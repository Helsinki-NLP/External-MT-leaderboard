The current cases of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The number of cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area is increasing at a similar rate to the UK, with a more rapid rate of COVID-19 outbreak in all countries at different stages.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their availability to the COVID-19 patient base for potential healthcare arrivals, especially those requiring intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the novel coronavirus 2 as the disease variant, now known as SARS-CoV-2.
It was later named SARS-CoV-2 - caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
According to current data, 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have had mild illness, with or without pneumonia, such as respiratory tract infection.
14% of COVID-19 cases are life-threatening illnesses requiring medical attention, while the remaining 6% are serious cases requiring advanced care.
The death rate for patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 was 4%.
In this study, we focus on comparing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with Hubei, China.
We compared COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread in more geographically dispersed regions, and the global COVID-19 epidemic has similar characteristics to that of the country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
At a Eurovigilance meeting on 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. announced the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe using WHO case definitions.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China were reported by France 24 in January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK). As of 31 December 2019, there have been 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths as of that date. Of these, 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Find the total number of COVID-19 cases and total incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) always updates the COVID-19 global status at 8:00 a.m. using information from relevant sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health administrations and WHO.
These data were collected to review COVID-19 developments in the EU/EEA and the UK and used for comparison with Italy.
We have compiled a 14-day COVID-19 case count based on the suggested natural travel of COVID-19 cases between EU/EEA and UK countries from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We present the country-by-country total reported on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the Italian figures for January 31 - March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA and UK
14 days of COVID-19 transmission in EU/EEA countries and the UK after the Chinese Hubei outbreak (Figure 1)
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases started to decline after 21 February, and then increased by a factor of 10 after 28 February 2020 (Helpful Materials).
This was largely driven by the high prevalence of the virus in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported similar increases in the number of COVID-19 cases.
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to the Italian cases from 31 January-15 March 2020.
At 8am on 15 March, the highest number of cases was recorded in 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to the highest in Italy three weeks earlier.
Our results show that identified cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The overall COVID-19 incidence indicates that the epidemic is spreading relatively quickly in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different levels, with differences in national public health policies, different interpretations of cases that may exist in different countries, and different protocols for selecting patients who are eligible for COVID-19 testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in other affected regions of Italy were seeking intensive care, which was the case for less than 10% of COVID-19 patients, according to media reports, and intensive care units in the region were the best in the country.
Current data on COVID-19 admissions at EU/EEA level are 6% in hospitals and 1% in intensive care (data not disclosed).
They should be gathered in a strategic manner to align with research that is focused on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010/11 study found that there was a wide gap in the level of higher and middle income support, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have a higher or lower level of wealth than Italy (12.5 intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modelling conditions related to healthcare capacity are in the sixth improvement in the ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment, including a >90% risk of treatment-inpatient COVID-19 cases and intensive care beds exceeding the maximum capacity in EU/EEA and UK countries.
In some EU/EEA countries and the UK, treatment and intensive care services in certain regions are provided to people from a limited area, and for these patients, the reference bed should be at the level of the assigned regional unit for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and other recent developments in other countries shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing at a rapid pace in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, medical and emergency departments should make the necessary preparations for the possible next outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the number of COVID-19 cases, as healthcare workers and emergency services may be needed in areas such as the affected parts of Italy.
A recent ECDC risk assessment report suggests that rapid, urgent and comprehensive approaches can reduce the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
A rapid risk assessment outlines public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have a short window of opportunity to improve their controls to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
Failure to do so could lead to a worsening of the health of patients requiring intensive care in other EU/EEA countries within days or weeks.
The 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected up to 80,000, with further deaths in other parts of the world.
Just as SARS-CoV infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from a tick in a similar manner and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate and higher transmission than SARS, affecting older men more often than younger men and more often than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of new infections, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research project.
We will cover basic issues related to epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this summary will help to understand and eliminate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 is believed to have been a memorable day for all Chinese who stayed indoors during the spring and coming weeks due to the new virus pandemic.
The virus has strong similarities to the SARS coronavirus, which caused the 2003 pandemic, and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease is COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one public enemy and is more dangerous than diarrhoea.
Since the release of viral sequencing from multiple patients on January 7, 2020, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment have been published in less than two months, according to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).
This review attempts to capture the study's interest in the new and fast-growing topic.
When possible, compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, MERS (the 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the prevention and prediction of the disease, some of the most pressing questions to be answered, and what we should consider so far.
CoVs are generally considered to be life-threatening in infants and are responsible for up to 15% of flu complications.
However, two outbreaks of CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have occurred in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and subsequently spread to other countries, causing serious illness and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV pandemic in human history.
As shown in Fig.1.1, on 31 December 2019, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were reported for the first time from Wuhan to China by the National Health Commission.
The CoV sequence was identified seven days later.
The first death from water was reported on January 15, 2020.
Eventually, the outbreak is spreading to neighboring cities, states and countries through the Nahr.
On January 20, health care providers were given a positive assessment of the virus, suggesting that it could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, a curfew was imposed in Wuhan, halting public transportation.
A preliminary clinical trial on January 24 revealed that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases were in direct contact with a Wuhan seafood market, where the disease is thought to have originated from an unknown animal, according to a preliminary clinical study.
The WHO declared the pandemic a global emergency on 30 January.
As of this writing, the outbreak has spread throughout China and to 50 other dependent countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
The extent of the outbreak is unpredictable as the situation is developing rapidly.
On February 11, 2020, the Multiple Resistance Center, which has received 8866 patients including 4021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, provided the following update on the outbreak (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects all age groups, most commonly those aged 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the infected patients were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and 14 patients were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread by cluster within Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days
The basic production number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), while the modified R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased sharply on January 23, 2020, due to the Chinese Spring Festival's heavy travel.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the overall mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most important risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of adult and envelope viruses with a strand of RNA that is sensitive to RNA.
Alpha, beta, gamma and delta are four genera. Alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptidease 4 (DPP4) receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively.
The viral RNA genome is transferred to the cytoplasm; once the viral genome is replicated, the genomic RNA is bound together by envelope glycoproteins and nanocapsid proteins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to form a virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 consecutive samples taken from the Hunan seafood market where the disease was first detected.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SaRS-CoV.
Electron microscopy detects particles of SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory epithelium through ultrasonic sections.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV:
However, compared to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a weaker affinity for human ACE2, which makes SARS-CoV-2 more susceptible to mild disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can produce novel proteins encoded by orf3b and secreted by orf8:
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and in inhibiting IFNβ; orf8 production, but has no known functional domain or pattern.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that full-length human ACE2 had a cryogenic EM structure at 2.9 Å resolution with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
The complex with a malignant and inhibitory structure was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex was found to bind to two S proteins, providing a clue to the identification and infection of the CoV.
A disinfection using B0AT1 is required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Ring and the Median Bearer
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have evolved from mosquitoes and transmitted to humans in sequence through the blood of rats and camels.
Using phylogenetics, comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs showed that this novel virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs from the bat bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, making it the first carrier of SARS-CoV-2 as a lococitus.
However, the intermediate transmitter that caused the virus to spread beyond the genome to humans is unknown, and the transmission line is not distinct.
Ji, et al., suggested that mice may be carriers of the virus from humans to humans, which involves the fusion of homologous genes with S proteins.
A study in Guangzhou, China, found that the 99% genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolin is the main carrier of SARS-CoV-2, with the most commonly used mammals, such as pangolins, being the most commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is itself a significant difference, and a final result is needed to provide a definitive definition. (Fig. (Fig.33)
The physicochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a hot environment for up to 48 hours at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% humidity for up to 1.5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar behavior.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to degrade by exposure to ultraviolet radiation and 30 minutes at 56 degrees Celsius. 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing antibiotics, pyractic acid, chlorophorum and other fatty liquids, but chlorhexidine, can degrade the virus.
Humans have a weak immune system to SARS-CoV-2, making them susceptible to new viruses.
Currently, there is no detailed assessment of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
As such, we see previous studies of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).4)
The virus generally initially binds to the host's innate immune system after it has eaten the host, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
The virus can slow the spread of the virus by producing inflammatory factors, dendritic cells and type I interferons (IFNs) by using a variety of routes, and the virus antigen is eliminated by macrophages.
The SARS-CoV N protein helps the virus to escape the immune system.
The adaptive immune system begins to work with others to stop the virus.
T lymphocytes such as CD4+ and CD8+ play a major role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce antibodies to the virus. CD8+ T cells directly kill cells that are infected with the virus.
T helper cells produce cytokines, which are anti-infective to help protect the cells.
However, CoVs can also infect T-cell membranes by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral antibodies such as C3a, C5a and antibodies are essential to suppress the virus.
For example, antibodies from recovered patients degrade MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, high levels of free radicals that exceed the immune system's response can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, can lead to death from damage to more than one organ.
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be more likely to affect older and weaker people with a group-borne origin and a combination of health conditions.
People who are exposed to multiple viruses and have weakened immune systems are more likely to be infected than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is on average 1-14 days, with the initial 425 cases in Wuhan lasting an average of 3-7 weeks.
However, a study of 1,099 cases suggested that the incubation period was on average 3 days and could last from 0 to 24 days.
As noted above, a recent study of 8,866 people found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) times.
Patients who do not show symptoms should be kept in isolation by medical authorities and should not transmit the disease.
Normally, people infected with the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The primary and most important symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be present alone or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, constipation, vomiting and vomiting.
Some patients have shown symptoms of dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after a single infection.
In severe cases, patients are more likely to develop severe respiratory problems, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and sudden fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no symptoms of the disease.
A demographic survey conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of patients with symptoms was 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dehydration, and 3% diarrhoea, with 8% of all patients requiring respiratory support.
Two recent studies of family co-infections and another of a non-symptomatic group of people have found similar results.
In contrast, a 2012 demographic study of MERS-CoV patients found that the main symptoms were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of cases require respiratory assistance, which is more dangerous than COVID-19 and is similar to MERS.
Constipation (26%) and throat infections (21%) have also been reported in MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), constipation (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms of SARS patients, and respiratory aid was found to be necessary in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the global total of 66:576 cases was at a 2% risk of COVID-19 death.
In contrast, the SARS mortality rate in 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 reported.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% with 2,494 confirmed cases, based on June 2012 demographic data.
Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 R0 ranges from 6.47 to 5.71-7.23 95% confidence interval (CI), while SARS-CoV R0 ranges from 2 to 4 purity.
Comparisons of the mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV to SARA-CoV for comparative symptoms are presented in Table 1.1.
The above statistics indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible and less lethal than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group outings occur in the same family or from the same gatherings or vehicle, such as a freighter.
Patients had a history of travel, lived in Wuhan or other affected areas, and had contact with infected or uninfected people in the past two weeks.
However, they suggest that quarantine periods should be extended as patients may remain asymptomatic for longer periods and recovered patients may be carriers of the virus.
In the first stage, patients have a lower or normal number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphadenesia with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L, a high lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, high amyotrophic lateral sclerosis levels and viruses were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients:
Most patients have elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in their blood, and in some patients, elevated levels of liver, gallbladder enzymes and myoglobin.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin-producing substance in the blood, is elevated and the number of lymphocytes is significantly reduced.
Unusual symptoms on chest X-rays are common in most COVID-19 patients, such as patchy shadows on the lungs or ground glass opacity.
Most patients are at risk for chronic pneumonia, sudden lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS causes air circulation problems, causing uncontrolled diarrhea, fluid retention and subsequent fibrosis.
If type-I and type-II lymphocytes fail to function properly, surfactant levels decrease, increasing the surface tension of the lung, causing the lung to become less dilated and closed.
Therefore, the worst results of samba radhi are associated with a significantly worse stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first diagnosis of COVID-19 was made with symptoms similar to those of other viral diseases and ARDS, including pneumonia, hyaline membrane disease, and a death from multinucleated syncytial cells and a buildup of intra-lung.
Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase has been used as a key step in COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high prevalence of false-negative cases, diagnosis using clinical signs (not just RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020 and could potentially delay the outbreak.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS test.
Therefore, the disease history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and RG results are generally important for a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang team announced a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for isolating SARS-CoV-2, which allows for the isolation of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick, without requiring an additional tool for less than an hour.
It is hoped that the new technique will bring about a change in the level of accessibility and convenience in the form of a closed loop.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors are only able to provide general care to COVID-19 patients.Alongside, trials are underway using CoVs and therapies for other viral diseases, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Table 2).
These treatments include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It has been suggested that plasma from survivors could be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the lungs and to a lesser extent other ACE2-positive organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory problems and failure are the leading causes of serious accidents and deaths in patients.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical in reducing symptoms and saving lives, including oxygen, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms are assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a novel cardiopulmonary bypass technique for use in patients with severe heart or respiratory problems.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organs are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
This cytokine storm comes as patients with SARS and MERS overreact to the immune response.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response that is caused by a buildup of various cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to break down free radicals, causing ARDS and many other internal organ problems.
Immunosuppression of cytokine release is particularly useful in treating severe patients.
Toquilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, and corticosteroids have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunological measures for cytotoxin storm include cell-specific immune response modulation, IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors; NJK blinatumomab; cytokine signaling signaling 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of infection damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They reverse the course of the disease by treating dangerous side effects such as vascular osteonecrosis.
However, it is recommended to use shorter courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses in severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral drug has been found.
However, a nucleotide analogue-based test was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was developed to kill other white-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Inspired by this, Gilead has sent a test kit to China to test a series of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, with highly anticipated results.
Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are also suggested to be used as therapeutic agents in patients with sudden respiratory distress.
Concomitant use of lopinavir/ritonavir may cause constipation, vomiting, vomiting, damage to the gastrointestinal tract and other risks.
Use of these medications in combination with other medications should be used with caution in patients.
Plasma and antibody production from survivors
Blood from survivors of infectious diseases has a long history of being used as medicine for other terminally ill patients and as a preventive measure for people who have not yet been infected.
Indeed, people who have recovered from an illness have higher levels of antibodies in their blood that can fight off the disease.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes and are involved in the attack of pathogens and other foreign substances on the body by isolating the individual molecules in the cells.
In response, plasma samples were collected from patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and given to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced infection and lower viral loads, along with improved oxygenation.
However, there must be evidence and evidence that a drug can be used on a large scale before it can be developed.
In addition, some plasma-related injuries should be treated with caution in view of the potential for medical effects.
For example, antibodies can trigger a dangerous disease called cytokine-relieving syndrome by activating the immune system.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is relatively low. They have a high plasma requirement for patients with severe disease.
It is difficult to produce specific antibodies quickly to prevent the disease.
Therefore, it is important to extract B cells from survivors and find genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or effective antibodies that work to destroy the main viral protein.
This allows us to measure the production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, TCM has been used in China to treat a variety of ailments.
However, the results are based on a combination of different components, based on a diagnosis and using a conversion formula based on TCM theory.
As such components are difficult to isolate, most of the active components are unknown or not clearly identified.
Currently, due to the lack of a standard treatment for COVID-19 and the lack of a specific treatment, TCM remains one of the main options for treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms who have recovered from more severe conditions.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be potential COVID-19 treatments.
In the treatment of COVID-19 patients, many provinces have high survival rates, including Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), where TCM treatment was used in 87% of patients, but Hubei Province had the lowest survival rate (13%) with TCM treatment used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a very inaccurate comparison and other factors such as weight and number of patients were not included in the estimate.
On February 18, 2020, Bollie Jang and colleagues presented a study combining Western Medicine (WM) alone with WM for TCM.
Patients in the WM+TCM group require only a short period of time to return to normal, to resolve symptoms and to withdraw from treatment, compared to the WM+TCM group alone.
Interestingly, the incidence of symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Blood-controlled trials should be conducted on a larger scale and in more facilities to ensure the effectiveness and safety of TCM.
The practice of TCM is highly motivated in determining the practical routes of treatment and in the most efficient manner possible in the elimination of their components.
Suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience severe anxiety due to the infectiousness and risk of the disease.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia and asthma, and other unintended effects such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to anxiety and mental instability.
Mental disorders such as chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and suicidal thoughts have been reported in the early stages of the SARS epidemic.
Cleanup and quarantine to replace COVID-19 mandates can make people more vulnerable to stress and anxiety.
Therefore, psychological support should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and contacts, and the general public.
The documentary mental health support included a review of teams of mental health professionals from multiple disciplines, regular and accurate communications on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and treatment plans, and clear improvements to protect your friends from the use of professional electronic devices and applications.
An effective vaccine is needed to break the chain of transmission from carriers and infected patients to people who are in good health.
Efforts are underway to develop a long-acting, well-functioning S-protein-based vaccine that will reduce the immune response to SARS-CoV with antibodies that are weakening.
Vaccines made from weakened SARS viruses have been tested on animals.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and the immunity of the in vivo-testing models against animal-derived viruses are to be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is because no new cases have been reported since SARS was eradicated 17 years ago.
Unusually, irregular MERS cases and clusters have been detected in the Middle East and spread to other areas with animal carriers.
A vaccine strategy for MERS was developed using non-activated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and subunits.
To control this future outbreak, we need the development of a safe and effective vaccine that is safe and effective for people who are not immunized against SARS-CoV-2.
However, the time required to develop a vaccine (an average of 18 months) is extremely difficult to overcome due to the variable nature of CoVs.
COVID-19 is a new disease and has now begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
Patients often survive without treatment.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 causes a higher incidence and mortality among patients with severe cases, with higher rates of mental retardation.
Therefore, a model of disease prediction is needed to give health agencies priority over services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors are thought to influence the prognosis of COVID-19 (Box 33):
Age is important to understand the prevalence of SARS and COVID-19.
The confirmation of 8,866 cases, as noted above, showed that COVID-19 occurred primarily in people aged 30-65, of whom 47.7% were over 50.
Patients waiting for intensive care services are more likely to have chronic health problems and be older (average age 66 versus 51), indicating that age is a significant contributor to the risk of disease in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect males from females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as described above.
Additional illnesses and consequences: COVID-19 patients who require advanced medical care are at higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest and arrhythmia than others.
Heart-related issues were also a prominent cause of death in SARS.
There are reports that SARS-COV-2 may combine with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes in COVID-19 patients to cause inflammatory disease.
It should be noted that age and health conditions can be correlated and contradictory.
Abnormal laboratory results can reveal levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood of inflammation or tissue damage and tell us about the prognosis of the disease, response to medication and survival of the patient.
It has been suggested that CRP levels may be related to COVID-19 prognosis.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may predict outcomes.
These enzymes are found in various organs, especially in the spleen and liver, to help relieve tissue damage.
So they are the ones who tell us about heart disease or colorectal cancer.
Major clinical signs, chest radiography and the transient progression of clinical symptoms along with other conditions should be considered in predicting COVID-19 outcome and associated symptoms.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of infectious disease damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are used in severe SARS patients, most survivors of the disease have suffered from vascular osteonecrosis, age-related disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses in COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Depression: As mentioned above, many patients suffer from depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people are isolated and close relatives and patients die.
It is clear that psychosocial counseling and long-term support are needed to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on June-population studies, COVID-19 has different epidemiological patterns from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 also causes respiratory infection in the lower respiratory tract, and other CoVs that cause tuberculosis also cause respiratory infection in the upper respiratory tract, but do not show any symptoms in the first stage of mild or moderate infection.
Therefore, patients with the infection in the early stages of the disease or in the isolation phase are more likely to produce large amounts of the virus in their daily activities, which poses a major challenge in controlling the outbreak.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is higher in severely ill patients and much lower in initially rare patients.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be more dangerous than the SARS pandemic.
Efforts are underway in China to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by closing Wuhan and surrounding areas and quarantining the population.
Although these actions have hurt the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is slowing.
The epidemic is expected to end in March and low cases will persist for 3-4 months.
However, some professionals are not so positive.
Paul Hunter, et al. predict that COVID-19, which appears to be more severe than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbine and throat-tubal fluid in patients discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus is likely to be a flu-like cyclical one.
However, as new cases of ANA have decreased, there have been promising signs in China that these current strategies may be working.
Ebola was projected to cause about one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is less likely to cause illness and death and may be a co-infecting virus with humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS are shown below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing and sneezing, but can also be transmitted by continuous contact with materials infected with the virus.
The virus is also known to be capable of oral-to-oral transmission if it is found in the mouth.
A recent review of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were caused by nosocomial infections, and 17 patients, including 40 healthcare professionals, had other conditions.
Therefore, special precautions must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, employees and even those who have contact with patients who are not their own.
The risk of infection can be reduced by using face masks, surgical masks and N95 respirators (series #1860s) as a first line of defense, which can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid from the infected person from traveling through the air and from sticking to the surface of objects and spreading to other people.
However, only N95 (series #1860s) masks can block viruses with a diameter of 10 to 80 nm. Only 5% of these viruses can penetrate the mask.
As patients can carry up to five surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear face coverings and white gowns to reduce transmission of the virus.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask.The virus is thought to have entered through the inflammatory eye.
Healthcare professionals should wear face coverings or goggles when treating patients.
Washing hands with soap more often than usual, staying indoors and reducing contact with affected people are essential for people living in affected areas.
People should keep at least three feet away from the patient.
These activities are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the disease from spreading.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human virus, it was announced on 7 January 2020 that the similarities between the virus and SARS-CoV should have been a major warning to China based on the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was unable to reassure citizens that the novel virus was low-transmission, had limited human-to-human transmission, and would not be difficult to control.
The message helped ease the fear in the population, especially as the entire country prepared for the spring break, a critical time to control the disease while it was still in Wuhan.
The Chinese Agency for Disease Control has learned this hard lesson and can make important improvements for the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be careful about the words they use when making public statements, as their reasons may change the public's perceptions and decisions; (2) avoid waiting for a regular statement from doctors or officials; (3) avoid attempting to prevent the public from doing the necessary prevention work at an early stage of the epidemic; and (4) improve the public's awareness and understanding of the epidemic by adopting clear and targeted behaviors that are consistent with the community response and response system.
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2, began in December 2019.
In less than two months of writing, the post has been distributed across China and to more than 50 countries.
The virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19 and SARS, which makes the COVID-19 pandemic similar to SARS.
However, there are important differences between COVID-19 and SARS that can be seen as important in controlling the disease and the pandemic.
COVID-19 affects adults more often than young people and males more often than females. The risk and mortality rate of the disease is higher from young to old.
SARS has a higher mortality rate (10.91% vs. 1.44%) than COVID-19.
COVID-19 patients are more likely to transmit the virus even if they do not show symptoms, but SARS patients are more likely to do so when they are very ill, making COVID-19 more difficult to control than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA of SARS-CoV-2 may be positive in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered may also have a second virus strain.
These findings are linked to the immediate spread of the virus.
Many critical challenges are expected to be addressed in rapid COVID-19 testing.
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like co-infections, it is not possible to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is a co-infection.
What animal is the intermediary transmitter of the virus from its primary carrier, the human to human contact?
If we do not know the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot completely prevent the disease and therefore the epidemic may return.
Molecular modeling and biochemical assays suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how does the virus enter cells in the respiratory tract and cause pathological mutations?
Does the virus also contain ACE2-EXPRESSING agents?
Without clear answers to these questions, prompt diagnosis and effective treatment are not possible.
How long can the epidemic last?
How does the virus show genetic changes when transmitted from person to person?
Will there be a global pandemic, a SARS-like outbreak, or a recurrence like the flu?
While important, it takes time to conduct the research needed to answer these and other questions.
However, we have no choice but to end the pandemic as quickly as possible and return to normal life, at whatever cost.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
Coronaviruses and CoVs, including humans, have evolved their resistance to mutation and adaptation over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause moderate disease such as tuberculosis.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemic have shown that HCoV infection is life-threatening wherever it occurs.
SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in central China in 2019 as a European controlled virus.CoVs have a higher transmission rate but a slower morbidity than SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are zoonotic and it is useful to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originate from non-transmitting viruses.
The intermediate host of HCoVs is also known.
Animal feces recognition plays a major role in the detection of disease immunity.
Studying and testing animal contact with CoV-infected individuals can help to better identify disease transmission.
This study includes our knowledge of the seven HCoVs based on their history of detection and animal-to-human transmission.
The main differences are the similarity and differentiation of the different types of HCoVs in terms of mutation and genome composition.
The COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this article.
We also discussed the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease and the progress of the transition from host to host.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae.The Coronaviridae include enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA virus groups.
These viruses are large, non-specific organisms with a genome of 26 to 32 kg, and are called CoVs because of their crown-right structure.
Unsegmented CoVs share the same genome structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into pp1a and pp1ab for replicate polyproteins.
These polyproteins are made from non-structured protein 16 called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of the amorphous protein ORF, which contains spike (S), membrane (E), thin membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Lineage-specific helper proteins are covered by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein structure, CoVs are divided into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). Of these, beta-CoVs contain most HCoVs and have forty subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Paleogenic description Flies and mice are the gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary hosts of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have transcended racial boundaries and some have managed to become serious human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
There are alpha-CoVs between HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 exhibit symptoms similar to fever and cough.
It has a higher morbidity potential compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2, and is associated with a higher risk of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and symptoms of extrapulmonary disease in most people following severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first HCoV-229E, B814, was detected in the feces of a malaria patient in 1960.
Subsequent studies of the measles-causing viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have provided further insights.
Before the SARS pandemic, HCoVs were thought to be harmless.
The worst SARS epidemic in history was reported in 2003. It affected more than 8,000 people, and 10% of them died.
A decade later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has become a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV) variant of the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The world is on the alert to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs originated from domestic animals such as bats, mice and other mammals.
Several lines of evidence suggest that all HCoVs from mosquitoes originate from a single source, provided that the viruses are not well adapted and pathogenic but show extensive genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major medical, scientific, social and moral upheavals in China and the world.
Understanding the natural history, driving forces and reasons for the racial restrictions are necessary to trace the zoonotic origins of HCoVs.
This can lead to the development and success of host-specific, interspecific and multiplying host-specific cells for SARS-CoV-2, useful measures to prevent further spread.
This review includes animal cloning of HCoVs, their ability to transmit from animal to animal and their ability to cause disease.
In particular, we discussed similarities between HCoVs and the fact that viruses do not cause disease in their primary host but start to mutate after transmission to another species.
The ability of HCoVs to transmit is largely attributed to their reduced pathogenicity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is also discussed in this opinion.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first case of HCoV-229E strain B814 was detected in humans, several viruses were found in camels, rats, mice, rats and rats.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV transmission in sequence (Table 1) will be a guide and a guide.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in 1966 from people with upper respiratory tract disease, but later adapted and grew in the WI-38 lung tract.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have shown common symptoms of chills, such as headache, nausea, nausea and sore throat, with fever and tuberculosis present in 10 to 20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was detected in organ culture and later in the spleen of a rat.
Clinical manifestations of infection with HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E. These have no distinct symptoms from other viruses that cause respiratory infections, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have been globally circulating, and are seen to be more prevalent in the tropical rainforest this summer.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a two-week illness period.
Research on volunteers suggests that people infected with HCoV-229E have had symptoms of concomitant fever.
Only a small number of patients with weakened immune systems developed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as non-communicable pneumonia, is the first documented global pandemic in human history, with SARS-CoV as the cause, and the third HCoV identified.
The first SARS case was reported in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
There have been 8,096 cases of SARS in several countries and territories, resulting in 774 deaths.
Highly transmissible strains can produce approximately two new cases each, requiring an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with peak viral load occurring on day 10.
People infected with SARS-CoV show symptoms of chronic pain, headache, fever, fatigue and cough, shortness of breath, fever and respiratory illness.
Lymphedema, impaired liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages have been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, organs such as the throat, liver and kidneys can also be affected in severe cases. In such cases, the presence of high levels of cytokines can be a major problem for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, many efforts have been devoted to studying HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals with respiratory disease.
Symptoms of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Other studies have shown that a pneumonia-infected baby in the Netherlands aged 8 months or older can acquire the same virus from an anthrax swab sample.
Although it is popular in the Netherlands, it has been adopted internationally.
HCoV-NL63 is responsible for up to 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with the highest incidence occurring in early winter, spring and summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the Langkawi influenza.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man admitted to hospital in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
HCoV-HKU1 is closely related to acute in addition to community pneumonia and bronchitis.
Along with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has also been found globally, causing mild respiratory illness.
The four locally transmitted HCoVs are well adapted to humans and have low susceptibility to infection, although there have been unknown outbreaks of HCoV-NL63 in recent years, causing severe lower respiratory illness in China.
In general, HCoVs are less likely to cause harm if they are able to transmit and survive in the body.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in a 60-year-old patient with severe acute myocardial infarction and kidney disease in Saudi Arabia.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, with secondary transmission reported in several European countries and Tunisia, the most recent of the newly arrived cases.
In 2015, 186 confirmed cases of secondary epidemics were reported in South Korea.
MERS clinical symptoms are similar to SARS, with severe progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, patients infected with MERS are more likely to develop acute renal failure. This makes the disease different from other HCoV-borne diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have shown a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses known to humans.
In December 2019, a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has named the next major respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, as a global public health threat.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases and 3.4% deaths have been reported globally.
The death rate is 4.2% in Hebei, especially, and 1.2% in other parts of China.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness, and its symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Constipation has been reported in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV is 82% similar to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of high nucleotide sequence homology, they are in different paleogenic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower incidence and higher transmissibility compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and are contributing to the rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 shows significant similarities and differences compared to six other HCoVs.
First, the transmission of HCoV infection in the hemisphere is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 has paved the way for six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on the relationship between SARS-CoV and the four environmentally transmitted HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections often exhibit characteristics of environmentally transmitted HCoVs, including ambiguity, mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Alternatively, small cases of severe COVID-19 may be considered SARS-CoV infections, although the ratio is low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the surprising nature of environmentally transmitted HCoVs to SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to infection than environmentally transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 reduces human-to-human transmission, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do.
Finally, as with other HIV, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in fecal samples:
The role of SARS-CoV-2 in oral transmission in some cases, as with SARS-CoV, is expected to be revealed in further research.
SARS-CoV-2 mutations are expected to be detected in communities infected with HCoVs at different times of the year.
However, the nature of SARS-CoV-2's transmissibility and risk factors determine the COVID-19 pandemic.
The four community-acquired HCoVs show mild symptoms of disease.
On the other hand, humans may be susceptible to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of an ancient HCoV pandemic.
Currently, there are no HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and no people with dangerous symptoms due to HCoVs.
For this to happen, HCoVs must be able to reproduce with extensive and extensive mitigating mutations.
Therefore, the greater the number of people and the greater the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the greater the likelihood of transmission to humans.
If properly adapted, pandemics can be difficult to control by quarantine or other governments.
For many years, the four CoVs in the community have been transmitting TB to infect healthy people.
These viruses need animal shelter.
In general, SARS-CoVs with high infectivity are not well adapted to MERS-CoVs and cannot be linked to human-to-human transmission.
They must remain and reproduce in their zoonotic habitats and seek the opportunity to disperse to a predatory human target, using one or more intermediate and transitional habitats.
SARS-CoV-2 shares similar characteristics with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, the four environmentally transmitted HCoVs.
This is similar to the HCoVs found in the environment, which are at least for now widely distributed.
However, it is more resistant and better than community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet known whether it will fully adapt to humans or whether it will be able to move around in humans without protection or between animals.
Before using animal strains of HCoVs, it is useful to investigate the evolutionary status, natural distribution, intermediate distribution and distribution of HCoVs.
Animals with homology similar to their existing habitat in the level of nucleotide sequences are classified as hosts of HCoVs.
This hereditary virus is a mildly contagious and non-infectious agent in its native habitat.
As such, the human's own body can remain a long-term host for HCoVs.
In both cases, these hosts are naturally transmitted HCoVs or their virus descendants.
Conversely, a short-term transmission from an HCoV-infected animal to a human can cause serious illness because the virus is not adapted to the new carrier.
The animal that is the primary carrier of the virus acts as a vector for human infection and also plays a key role in the virus's ability to temporarily infect the animal by replicating within it.
HCoV death can eventually cause infection if it cannot continue to be transmitted within an intermediate range.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to living environments and can survive for long periods of time.
During this time, the midline becomes a natural seat.
Epidemiological data show that SARS index cases have a history of being linked to toy animals.
A series of serum prevalence tests showed that animal traders are higher carrier of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
The coveted bats (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon and the akhal are the first known carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses in the animal market.
This was helped by the fact that SARS cases were not reported afterwards, as it indirectly killed all the infected in the market.
However, covered desert or farm insects without exposure to live animal markets were generally negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that covered insects are intermediate carriers of the host, not intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
In particular, more than 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, not forgetting that small rodents of various species are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the dead ends of the SARS-CoV host.
Subsequent studies of natural animal SARS-CoV hosts have shown a link to the rat CoV, SARS-related rhinolophus rat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horse shoe rats.
These viruses are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
This and other locust CoVs and SARS-CoVs have 88-92% of the same nucleotide.
These studies have revealed a new theory that bacteria produce human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are derived from mosquitoes, but other than WIV1, they are not viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV.
The tumor cell samples from WIV1 were modeled for the ACE2 receptor in tumors, mice and humans as a cell entry receptor.
Surprisingly, the convection serum of SARS patients was able to kill WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is a 95% nucleotide-like ancestor of SARS-CoV in the Lakota.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is believed to be not a SARS-CoV intermediate source virus and mosquitoes are not intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
Palogenetic analysis identifies MERS-CoV with the CoV-HKU4 group of the CoV-HKU5 group of the virus.
Both HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor as a precursor.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences have structural similarities to beta-CoVs found in Africa and Europe.
So far, no MERS-CoV has been found to survive in desert frogs.
MERS-CoV has 87% homology of the nucleotide sequence to its closest relative, the mosquito CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, viruses may not be direct intermediates for MERS-CoV.
In contrast, studies in the Middle East have confirmed that dromedary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific concentrated antibodies, similar to Middle Eastern camels from African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is identical to the virus found in humans, which was isolated from the nose swab of dromedary camels, which means that camels serve as a host for MERS-CoV Bona Fide.
It is also important to note that in the experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV, mild symptoms were observed with high viral transmission.
Obviously, infected camels transmit the virus not only by breathing but also by feces to mouth, which is the main route of transmission for the virus by mosquitoes.
However, as most confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels, questions are still being raised about the potential for human-to-human transmission, and the possibility of an unknown source of transmission, including an unknown animal species that carries MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with the rat CoV RaTG13, derived from rhinophyllous affine flies.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 mutation sequences is very difficult to separate.
This means that viruses may not be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless similar virulent CoVs are detected in the future.
A wholesale animal slaughterhouse in Hunan reports the first cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans.
Several recent studies have shown that several endangered species such as pangolin (Manis javina) may be susceptible to beta-CoVs of their genus related to SARS-CoV-2 based on their metagenomic sequence.
These new pangolin CoV genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are 90% identical to RaTG13 at the nucleotide level.
They are classified into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2, as are viruses in the paleogenetic branch, one of which shares a highly similar receptor (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark comparison, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 and RBDs are divergent, even with high degrees of homology genome sequence.
A study in infected pangolins reported viral contagion from a sample of the lung, which was similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study used a variety of interacting pathways and directions to sequence a portion of the genome, which makes up 86.3% of the full length of the virus genome.
Pangolin is likely to be an intermediate animal host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolins, which are caused by mutations in the scanning between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distances between the mongoose SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are smaller than between the SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is still unknown.
The highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and panglion; SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have high genome-wide sequence homology.
The high similarity of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 in the pangolin RBD is a convergent evolutionary finding that was selectively obtained.
A further proposal is needed for recombination between the panglionSARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild-animal genus.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination of beta-CoVs has become widespread.
The jury is working to determine the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been studied for their zoonotic origins.
The pathological identification of HCoV-NL63 indicates that HCoV-229E originated from rat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 originated from rat eggs.
A CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has been reported in North America with similarities to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is generally related to another leprosy CoV, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana and is suspected to have a potential intermediate host.
Animal cloning of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2 with the current knowledge.
Paleogenetic analysis suggests that there is historical evidence of HCoVs being transmitted between races.
A respiratory infection epidemic was reported in 1890 when HCoV-OC43 began infecting humans, not just domestic animals.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between different animal species is unclear.
Locucto alpha-CoVs have been found to have high similarity to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Evidence suggests that the virus is transmitted directly from cockroaches to humans.
Before alpacas, humans had to live in the same ecological habitat as the Lakota.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related mosquito alpha-CoVs are specific to mosquitoes and do not cause disease; alpaca alpha-CoVs cause respiratory infection in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not detected in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not excluded that alpacas may have transmitted this HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
Indeed, bedbugs are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nephritis and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E viruses can be transmitted directly to humans.
Although Lakota alpha-CoVs are a subtype of HCoV-229E, animals such as alpacas and Arabian camels have been able to transmit MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV may be a good example of a good case of cross-breeding from mosquito to dromedary camel from dromedary camel to human.
The origin of MERS-CoV from a tick was first identified in its early stages and was reinforced by subsequent contacts.
It is clear that the viruses carry several strains of the virus, which can cause inter-ethnic transmission.
Ticks are the main transmitter of the virus because of their longevity, hardiness, close proximity and ability to spread.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for decades.
The camels have been successfully adapted to become permanent residents.
In these animals, MERS-CoV was found to cause mild disease and have low mutation potential.
Because irregular human-to-human transmission is an exceptional case, humans remain the last carrier of MERS-CoV, and the epidemic may not be permanent.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unique, if any.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
The deadly host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, which may be a more aggressive case of SARS-CoV.
The role of SARS-CoV-2 in animal transmission is expected to be revealed in further research.
First, the SARS-CoV-2-related virus may be a host of the same type of virus as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niche with fleas by sniffing or sniffing.
In addition, pangolins have been identified as a SARS-CoV-2-like virus, making cattle one of the most vulnerable intermediate vectors of the virus.
People are infected by biting and eating meat.
Many pet animals, including humans, may be resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody testing in wild and domestic animals is permitted.
Third, as noted by Dr. Koch, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species if they were in contact with both the rat and pangolin.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Among these different types of animal hosts, there are three main methods to prevent CoVs from spreading to other strains.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
The average rate of mutation of CoVs is thought to be higher than that of other RNA viruses with white-stranded RNA.The average rate of mutation is ~10-4 mutations per year per site 2, which is determined by the adaptation of the new carrier to CoV.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonuclease, the destruction of which results in higher adaptation and mutation.
The nicotinic analogue called remdesivir prevents the propagation of CoVs by inhibiting exoribonucleases and RNA-binding RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is the most promising of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are millions higher than their homologues.
CoVs also mutate and adapt rapidly in the presence of a lack of immunity.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate, indicating a high adaptability to humans.
It may have been transmitted earlier to animals such as humans.
In addition, SARS-CoV-2, which also includes MERS-CoV, is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, genetic differences do not make vaccines or antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs also demonstrated rapid genome modification and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of cross-breeding and co-growth, and allowing these new CoVs to be released when conditions are favorable.
This is determined by the previous reading box and protein functions up to the last 3 genomes.
Third, during the hyperreproduction phase, RNA CoVs change their structure and substrate abruptly and repeatedly.
A host cell, a strand of transcriptional RNA that is frequently produced in CoV RNA transcription.
Full-length and subgenomic RNAs that are very similar combine to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetics has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal-infected CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The virus is transmitted by the human body.
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with its host receptors is a key factor in its ability to transmit from one species to another.
A combination of SARS-CoVs can be used as an example, which provides evidence of positive selection between different animal species during disease transmission.
Comparisons between human and variant SARS-CoVs have shown that SARS-CoVs are easily adaptable to a variety of hosts, particularly through RBD of S protein mutation.
In general, RBD is a S protein of the CoV that binds to the cellular receptor and is selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its common receptor for viral infection.
RBD can detect the ACE2 receptors of SARS-CoV in a variety of animals, including rats, mice, rats, rats and rats, allowing for cross-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to be distinct from human and RBD-derived viruses, and 4 are in the receptor-associated pattern to bind to the ACE2 receptor.
The active SARS-CoV K479N and S487T have mutations in RBD, which may increase the potential for these spike proteins to interact with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be critical to viral adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoVs-2 share the same cell type receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates the ability of the S protein to bind to human ACE2 in the S1 unit of the S protein.
Cryo-EM studies have shown that the combination of ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein in humans is 10 to 20 times higher.
It is also necessary to confirm that additional receptors are needed for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2 but with a distinct S subtype.
There are several HCoV receptors, including aminopeptidease A for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
CoVs that have been transmitted from different animals to humans may have a successful adaptation.
In addition to this receptor, the efficacy of these HCoVs for inter-species transmission is uncertain due to other host cell and restriction factors.
The isolation of these host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as mosquitoes, dromedary camels and mosquitoes may limit the transmission from one species to another.
HCoVs are resistant to host cell pathogens by invading host cell barriers and thus effectively reducing interspecies transmission.
Therefore, the molecular critical point in the relationship between viruses and carriers is still unknown.
Non-conformity of the genome-wide analysis of the host and the limiting causes of SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR state-of-the-art technology method may be fruitful.
Emergence of these new HCoVs, to return to zero
Variants of the HCoVs in the virus offer a high potential for emergence of new HCoVs.
This means that the CoVs serve as the gene carrier for the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination allow HCoVs to grow and serve as two steps in the process's advantages.
For example, the addition or absence of new protein-coding genes has the potential to dramatically improve viral phenotyping.
The presence of ORF8 in the SARS-CoV locusts, which is thought to be caused by the ORF8 in the SARS-CoV receptor protein, is not known; it is believed that ORF8 is responsible for the transmission to humans.
29-niclotide sequencing characteristics of SARS-CoVs were found in early human outbreaks of distinct strains.
This sequence of ORF8 is similar to ORF8a and ORF8b, which are adaptive mutations that help the virus to spread from one host to another.
SARS-CoV has a history of recombination with alpha-gamma lineages. A large number of small recombinant regions have been found in RNA-bound RNA polymerases.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and some parts of nsp14 are isolated within the recombination regions.
At the same time, MERS-CoV infection has been found to be transmitted in several lineages, most notably in the Saudi Arabian Deir Mandiri camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoVs also have a hybridization process. HCoVs are associated with animal CoVs through unstructured gene fusion.
And unwanted artificial selection can cause mutations in the virus' genome.
An example of these effects is the complete loss of ORF4 length in HCoV-229E prototitis configuration due to two-neuroxide deletion.
Uninfected ORF4 can be found in HCoV-229E-like viruses in cows and camels.Alpaca alpha-CoVs exhibit shadow nucleotide insertion and form a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is driven by the selection of their hosts.
CoVs have been reported to transmit either asymptomatically or only mildly, suggesting a dual nature of CoVs and infection.
It shows that viruses are highly adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the problem of pre-cancerous response activation by tumors significantly reduces the pathology of CoVs.
It also inhibits the killing mechanism in the pituitary gland due to the NKG2/CD94 receptor and low histolytic compatibility.
In addition, high levels of reactivation of oxygen species (ROS) can affect the growth and metabolism of CoVs through exoribonuclease, so introducing viral strains into new host cells can be highly pathogenic.
Additional pathogenic CoVs can attack cells by altering their protein or protein behavior.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new HCoVs have been created in the last two decades.
CoVs are pathogenic and live in the intestines of chickens and camels, but do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms.
They multiply rapidly when the immune system is weak.
There is a mystery as to why people do not show symptoms and why this infection causes serious illness in humans.
These severe symptoms are often caused by an over-reactive immune system, and cytokine storms in those with strong immune systems can cause severe lung damage.
On the contrary, those who do not show symptoms of the virus,
Similarly, a decline in immune function could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
This response to intrusion is particularly strong in tumors.
Therefore, it is useful to administer interferon type 1 to at least early-stage human SARS-CoV-2 infections.
In addition, NLRP3 does not activate the inflammatory response in the kidneys.
Therefore, MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 by blocking NLRP3 reuptake.
The SARS-CoV-2 emergence follows the general course of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.
The beta-CoV of Locucto has a 95% similarity to the nucleotide of SARS-CoV and a 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
Although animals in the market have been found to carry the same virus as SARS-CoV, no direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has yet been detected.
Pangolin beta-CoVs are remarkably homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2, which means that pangolins may serve as intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs contribute to the final stages of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments.
Despite the questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was accidental or man-made.
CoVs have been re-identified during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The safety of HCoVs in mice and other animals has led to a greater understanding of zoonotic origins and the importance of animal shelter for human HCoV transmission.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are thought to have originated in mosquitoes and are transmitted to humans through other vectors.
Closing down cheap markets and killing the infected, to replace SARS-CoV infection from humans to parasites in the marketplace, can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be withdrawn from the market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of several lineages that link pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future investigations into how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from panglions and other insects to humans will be controversial.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as useful transportation vehicles and are a major source of meat, dairy, leather and leather products for humans.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is possible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done in a wildlife market in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against camel MERS-CoV, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause epidemics.
Many human-to-animal CoVs are transmitted between animals.
There are many leprosy CoVs that can be transmitted to humans.
These animal CoVs may evolve and evolve to produce CoVs with higher transmissibility and potential for human exposure.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be banned to reduce the risk of human-animal conflict.
There needs to be better preparedness and response to the outbreak of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
Indeed, many viruses have been around for a very long time on this planet.
They are said to remain in their natural habitat until a chance of breeding is available.
Although there are many ways that mosquitoes can transmit the virus, transmission can be reduced by reducing human contact with mosquitoes and other wildlife.
Strict controls should be maintained in animal husbandry to reduce the transmission of diseases from animals to humans.
The most effective way to prevent animal-to-human transmission of infectious diseases is to avoid the environment in which animals carrying the dangerous virus live.
There are also unknowns in the SARS-CoV-2 management complex.
First, it is important to understand how flies and pangolins share a similar ecological niche if flies transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus from their relatives.
Human contact with animals should be limited as the virus plays a significant role in human transmission.
Third, if a third mammal is to be a suitable intermediate habitat, it must be able to cope with the different species of humans, including bats and pangolins.
Finally, many pet animals, including operatives, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and surveillance and testing of infections should be undertaken.
SARS-CoV-2 or the parent virus is believed to be the next natural host in the wild for cockroaches, pangolins and other mammals.
The field tests link the human COVID-19 immune system to the animal SARS-CoV-2 mutation.
Testing criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be updated periodically.
A paper published by our team on February 6, 2020, provides a proactive approach to combating the pandemic around the world by providing prompt guidance and practices for diagnosing and advising on novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Studies and collective experience in the field are gradually increasing our knowledge.
In this letter, in response to a comment in our guidelines, we have issued new guidelines for the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed patients as amended by the New Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of China.
A novel coronavirus, currently known as COVID-19, began circulating in December 2019 and is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
We have prepared and published an online advisory guide to help us succeed against SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 6, 2020 in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted much attention from the press.
However, given that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, so the diagnostic and treatment strategy is constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of China has published a total of seven editions of COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) with updates from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020.
We welcome the insight from Zhou et al., that they have developed a simple clinical experience-based measurement model.
Their work is also useful to the pandemic around the world as it can bring new information to our guide.
Let us show our appreciation by supporting their vital work.
However, the procedures need to be updated based on the new COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) Diagnosis and Treatment Guide and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a definitive study is to be conducted by combining one set of epidemiological histories and two sets of clinical samples to confirm the needs of suspected cases, or three sets of clinical data without a clear epidemiological history.
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history, residents of Wuhan and surrounding areas where COVID-19 infection has been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms appear, (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients (confirmed by nucleic acid testing), (3) history of contact with fever or other respiratory symptoms, residents of Wuhan and surrounding areas or areas where COVID-19 infection has been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms appear, (4) history of contact with group confirmed patients (≥ 2 patients with fever and/or other respiratory symptoms in the last 2 weeks, especially in confined spaces such as homes, offices or classrooms, etc.).
Clinical description: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms, (2) a picture of the characteristics of COVID-19 infection, (3) total number of normal, missing, or missing white blood cells at the initial stage of infection.
The following pathogenic or serological tests are suspected to be positive: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing with known coronaviruses showing high homogeneity; (3) SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody positive; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody changing from negative to positive, or in the recovery phase with an increase of ≥4 times the acute phase titer.
Real-time PCR for nucleic acid samples of respiratory and blood systems was published in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Diagnostic blood samples were included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, after which the serological theme was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the efforts of researchers to develop a more accurate nucleic acid detection kit. It also relies on the availability of better blood and respiratory samples and support for the introduction of positive results of antibiotics into proven doses.
The findings suggest that attention should be paid to people with unusual symptoms and no symptoms at all.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow chart should be improved to indicate that people without symptoms are at a lower risk.
This approach requires further practical and research validation.
We hope to get clear enough information to include and our readers will call us and give their views.
It is necessary to use the country's guidelines to distinguish between suspected and confirmed cases.
Our team provides temporary guidance.
Bangladesh reports five COVID-19 deaths, the highest on record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five deaths from COVID-19 at the same time.
This is the highest number of cases per day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases at home.
A total of 17 deaths were reported.
In an online news release, IEDCR directors, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the death toll included four men and women.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was 41-50 years old.
Both victims are from poor families.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, the local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, after being monitored by Kuwait's Maitre Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Monday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Infrastructure Obaidul Quader announced that public transport will be closed for a longer period of time than originally planned, until next Monday.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods -- medical, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on March 8, two people and the wife of one of them who had returned from Italy.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has passed the one million mark globally
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the day that Malawi reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus and Zambia recorded its first coronavirus death.
North Korea has announced that it is one of the few countries free of coronavirus as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, with 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours after 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with at least 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, more than 1,000 US deaths from coronavirus were reported on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Around the world, countries have announced restrictions on the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin said Russians will continue to receive their allowances until April 30.
The Portuguese government's parliament voted 215 to one to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days.
Saudi Arabia has extended its curfew on its holy sites of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, it was curfew from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand is set to enact a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
In Australia, stores have reduced the amount of soft drinks they can buy at a time.
On Sunday night, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles eased restrictions on the sale of single-packets of paper to each other.
On Monday, ALDI introduced a ban on only one bakko.
These restrictions were applied to outlets on Facebook and in bulk messages.
The increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 has been attributed to the increased need for self-quarantine.
On Thursday, Wal-Mart decided to sell toilet paper for home delivery as a single package per order.
The changes come after a ban on the simultaneous purchase of more than forty bags was imposed by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
In a statement on March 8, Coles said that while the ban on more than forty bakes is in place, "many stores are now selling their products within an hour of arrival".
According to a representative of Woolworths, the markets showed a strong rise last week.
Costco stores in Canberra have doubled the allowed pack size since last week.
To better address the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from the offer and repeat visits, Woolworth ordered additional offerings, and ALDI made the planned Wednesday special offerings available.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive secretary of the Australian Consumer Association, tried to raise prices, but local council restrictions on travel by car made it difficult.
Stores expect prices to rise as demand increases.
On Tuesday, ALDI said some stores would not be able to hold their Wednesday special market due to a rushed supply chain.
According to News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, the drugs are always filled at night.
The soft drinks are a huge commodity, with very few products on sale, and, once all are sold, a lot of storage space is empty, exacerbating the feeling of scarcity.
"If the look of coals and walnuts, the abundance of stocks on the shelves, and the availability and availability of products like toilet paper and sanitiser are increased, perhaps the shock can be reduced", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
A recycled toilet paper factory said production would be completed by Thursday.
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of the paper-based Clinix, and Sorbent, the maker of Solaris Pepper, are working 24/7 to keep the community close, News.com.au reported.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some sellers gave free toilet paper to the initial bidders at a Melbourne auction, while a few auctions were held over the weekend during the Sankey-branded daytime shopping holiday.
NT News, a Darwin daily newspaper, published an eight-page column in its Thursday edition that could be cut and used as a piece of paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, stores initially said they had no plans to set size limits on product orders, showing reluctance to implement the ban.
Russell Zimer and other products are also in high demand, including masks, cleaning products, paint products, laundry aids and heaters.
Similarly, outside Australia, the UK online supermarket Okado was seen to limit the 12 rolls of packaging to the Andrews toilet paper offerings on Sunday night.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the COVID-19 pandemic - a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - a pandemic.
"Although the term ""pandemic"" does not refer to the extent to which the disease is spread but rather to the extent to which it is dangerous, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that governments take action".
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
"Countries should be more responsive to populations and to identification, screening, detection, monitoring and travel", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are deeply concerned about this shocking scale and persistence, as well as the disturbing rate of negligence.
"According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was described as ""unexpected""".
"According to CNN's February edition, 'no respiratory virus has been contained from its onset to its global spread, except influenza.'"
Gbagbo also made a similar comment: "We have never seen such a coronavirus outbreak".
"We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled in the same time frame", he added.
The new regulation follows a January WHO decision declaring it a public health emergency requiring global attention.
"The last line, it will get very tough", said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases and 4,600 deaths worldwide.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20 is a continuation of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which is caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a global emergency on 30 February 2020, and a pandemic outbreak was declared on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories.
Some 364,000 people have been cured.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in the country, and the global average ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, fever and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include symptoms such as pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time period for symptoms to appear is usually five days from exposure to the meat, but can be extended from two to fourteen days.
To date, there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral drug.
Primary symptomatic and supportive care.Hand washing, coughing and mouth-to-mouth, social distancing, and isolation of suspected patients are some examples of precautions that can be taken.
Authorities around the world have issued responses to travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace injury prevention, and facility closures as follows:
The pandemic has led to a number of global social and economic disruptions, including a lack of funding for sports, religious issues, political and cultural events, cancellations of deadlines and humanitarian aid.
Schools and higher education institutions were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of international students.
Misinformation about the virus has been spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobic attacks on Chinese people and other people in East and Southeast Asia, who appear to be coming from areas affected by the virus.
Senki has reduced air pollution and carbon emissions by reducing travel and closing heavy industries.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province), began investigating in early January 2020 after reporting cases of unidentified pneumonia on December 31, 2019.
Most cases were linked to a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have spread from animals.
The virus that caused the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel virus similar to the contagious coronaviruses, Pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms was later diagnosed on 1 December 2019.
Two-thirds of the first group of patients identified in December 2019 were in contact with the marketplace.
On 13 March 2020, an unidentified source reported that, going back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province had reported that the initial case may have been the first.A WHO report dated 26 February 2020 noted that as new cases in China declined, with a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded those seen inside China for the first time.
There may be a high number of cases reported, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, the lowest number of cases were among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of the global population.Herd immunity is expected to develop if 60% of the UK population is to be infected with the virus, according to UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance.
A case is defined as the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results are positive according to the protocols established.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population.Many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had official policies against testing for mild symptoms.
A study released on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had not been detected, and these unregistered infections were the source of the outbreak in 79% of those who were detected.
The number of cases in Italy is estimated to be higher than the combined figure, according to a report published on 30 March.
The initial estimates of the baseline COVID-19 incidence rate (R0) were 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that the recommended reading is probably 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
In those who are not, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, but the most common is 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, there have been approximately 97,000 deaths from COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, around 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age, and 75% had other chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely higher because it does not include those who died at home, in care facilities, etc. without being tested.
Data from Italy shows that the number of deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID-19 death toll.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""we underestimated the mortality rate"" and that this was a reinforcement of the underestimates given by the U.S. underestimation numbers for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first recorded death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy, respectively, outside of Mainland China.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported homicides/deaths in Antarctica from all continents.
These figures vary by region over time, and are influenced by the number of tests performed, hygienic health care systems, treatment options, time since the outbreak began, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and overall health.
The global mortality and morbidity ratio is 6.0% (<97,039/1,617,204), according to Johns Hopkins University statistics as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
The relative mortality rate in China has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include mortality rate, infection mortality rate as a percentage of infected individuals, and infection mortality rate as a percentage of those who have been diagnosed and untreated with the disease.
These statistics are not time-specific, but are influenced by the population size of the cases.
Many researchers have attempted to construct these numbers in a population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the mortality rate following the outbreak to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This higher range estimate was accompanied by the results of a statistical study of the impact of randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany on CFR testing.
WHO has said the pandemic is under control.
The peak period of the pandemic and how long it will continue are unknown.
Massage Bonnie from Penn State University says that despite the lack of control, the number of people infected with the disease is declining after the spread of dengue.
However, at this time, it is not possible to make an accurate prediction of when this might happen.
"Former Chinese government medical adviser Zong Nansheng argued that ""the June flu could be gone"" if all countries follow the WHO advice on measures to stop the virus outbreak".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to survive for one to two years.
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing is necessary for other measures including vaccination (within 18 months of maximum and beyond).
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""The coronavirus is so fast-transmitting that it will not go away completely"" and that it "may be seasonal, but it may return in a year".
The incidence of reinfection depends on the community immunity of the disease and the prevalence of the infection.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively mild, and people infected with the virus may not show any symptoms.
Fever (88%) and dry fever (68%) are the most common symptoms.
Uncommon symptoms of fatigue include fluid drainage from the respiratory tract, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, joint and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, reaction, hemoptysis, cyanosis. According to the World Health Organization, one in six people will become seriously ill and have respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergencies such as shortness of breath, chronic pain or chest pressure, sudden tremor, difficulty in movement, and temporary lip or facial discomfort. It also recommends emergency medical attention if these symptoms occur.
Some of those infected may not show any symptoms, meaning they do not show any clinical signs, but tests confirm the presence of infection. Therefore, researchers recommend that people who have had close contact with a confirmed case should be closely monitored and tested for the presence of infection.
China is projected to grow from a few asymptomatic to 44 percent.
The average incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is usually five days, but varies from one to 14 days.As an example of uncertainty, the average number of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell dropped from the original 30% to 15%.
The detailed transmission of this disease is still being studied.
The disease is mainly transmitted by close contact, within 1-2 metres (3-6 feet) or by small particles that are not visible when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Studies show that spots from uncovered mud can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Although the virus is not transmitted through the air, some people suggest that the virus is transmitted through small, prolonged airborne particles that can be produced during speech.
These substances can be absorbed into the mouth or nose by people close to them or injected into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), cause the virus to spread through the air by mixing the air with the air in the respiratory system.
The virus can be transmitted by touching an infected object or body such as skin, eye, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may be transmitted by the Earth's eye, the risk is much lower.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via the soil.The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the spread can continue for the duration of the disease and before symptoms appear.
People can be diagnosed with the disease three days before they develop symptoms. This means that there is no evidence of infection.
There are few people without laboratory-confirmed symptoms, but studies suggest that they can transmit disease without any symptoms in certain countries.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) suggests that although it is not known how easily the disease is transmitted, it can infect two to three people in a single person.The virus can persist on the body surface for hours to days.
The virus can be detected on three layers of plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, cardboard for one day and meat for four hours in copper.
This, however, is affected by the temperature and humidity.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans, even if British authorities say you should wash your hands after handling animals as you would after handling infected property.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus type 2, first identified in three cases of pneumonia in Wuhan associated with severe respiratory distress.
All variants of this newly mutated SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the same natural coronaviruses.Since the virus is able to kill the parasite by penetrating the protective membrane outside the body, SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have been derived from animals.
Genetic research has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the betacoronavirus, and at the ethnic level to other strains of contagious viruses, including the subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B).
It is 96% identical to other bat-borne coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13) in the full genome levels.
Chinese researchers found in February 2020 that the human and animal-pathogenic pangolin viruses differ only in one amino acid.
At least 92% of the genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is similar enough to show complete genetic similarity, which is not enough to establish that pangolin is a medium carrier.
If the virus is detectable by symptoms, it should be confirmed by RT-PCR or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT indicates that CT is more effective at detecting the disease than PCR but is not able to distinguish it from other forms of pneumonia and infection.
"Starting in March 2020, the American College of Radiology advises that ""CT for COVID-19 vaccine should not be used as a primary antibody test""".
Various protocols for testing SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been published by WHO. The variant was identified by type 17.
The test used is called real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on a blood sample or a blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Generally, this test can be performed with a nasal swab or a throat swab. Blood antibody tests are also being developed by selected laboratories and companies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been sufficiently validated for widespread use.
US-based Cellex's antivirus testing laboratories have been approved for use by emergency services.
Radiographs and CT scans of asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions have been shown in people with no symptoms.
The results of the imaging of confirmed patients, which are distributed via the World Wide Web, are being prepared by the Italian Society of Radiology.
COVID-19 cannot be detected by PCR alone because it can be similar to other infectious diseases such as adenovirus.
Although oral cardiac CT results are less effective at isolating the disease from other diseases compared to PCR, a large study in China has shown that it is more effective at detecting acute and chronic disease.
Convolutional neural networks powered by artificial intelligence are being developed to display images of the virus, both by radiography and CT.
Physical hygiene: washing hands, rinsing hands, wiping eyes, not touching your nose or mouth, coughing or sneezing on soft drinks and then washing the soft drinks properly are some of the steps to prevent inflammation.
People who may be exposed to the contaminants are advised to wear surgical masks when in public places.
While physical distancing measures are recommended to prevent transmission, most governments have banned all non-essential travel to and from the affected areas and countries.
However, the virus has reached a point where it is spreading at the community level in most countries of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members are not aware of where and how they might be infected.Health professionals treating infected fat are advised to take appropriate precautions, including tooth extractions and eye care.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments has raised questions about privacy, and more than 100 other organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for a limit on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications are either in operation or available for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as sharing user proximity to other phones using Bluetooth.
Then, staff receive messages if they have been in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19. Misconceptions about preventing infection, such as washing the nose with water or rubbing the nose with a towel, are not effective.
Although many companies are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, there is no vaccine yet.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twelve seconds at a time, especially after using a toilet or if there is visible debris, before eating, after vomiting, coughing, and after vomiting.
This can kill the virus outside the human body, by shooting the soap-based products into the immune system.
The CDC further recommends the use of alcohol-based sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol at times when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with hand towels.
Body surfaces can be disinfected with a variety of chemicals (including stainless steel within one minute after application of the antibiotic): 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Others have a lower activity, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate.
CDC requires that all COVID facilities, such as childcare facilities, bathrooms, communal areas, shared-use electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines, be disinfected and cleaned during use by an infected person.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with their hands and wipe their socks with a cloth when painting or scratching.
Patients are advised to wear a medical mask. Wearing a mask is used to reduce the frequency and distance of respiratory droplets during speech, breathing, and breathing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use face masks.
Virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds said that as contact with the face with unwashed hands is a major public health concern, wearing a mask is encouraged and people who care for patients are advised to wear a mask.
Although the WHO believes that wearing a face mask is a risk factor for people to avoid exposure, it recommends that people in good health, including those caring for COVID-19 patients, wear a face mask only if they are at high risk.
Many countries are encouraging the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical cloth face masks. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks, especially for people who are in close contact with other people (less than 1 meter (3 feet) high) and are used by healthy members of the general public.
In Hong Kong, Kamtse Daly recommends wearing a surgical mask during public transportation when the wedding is in a crowded area.
Medical experts in Thailand urge people to make face masks at home and use them while bathing.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned the wearing of masks and face coverings in public places.
On March 16, Vietnam called on all people who went to public places to wear face masks to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that people entering grocery stores must wear face and neck masks.
Israel requires all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of masks for the princess since mid-March, has mandated that all passengers on trains and city buses wear masks from April 1.
Panama is making it mandatory to wear face masks when outdoors, and is encouraging home-made masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (i.e. physical distancing) includes contagion control measures to slow the spread of the disease by avoiding close contact.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas and shopping malls are some of the possible measures.
Individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding public gatherings, exchanging warm greetings, and maintaining physical distancing from others.
Many governments have or are considering imposing mandatory social distancing guidelines in the affected areas.
The high concentration rate recommended by U.S. health authorities dropped from 250 people (if there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state) to 50 people, and the severe one to 10 people.
Older adults and people with internal communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick and be affected. The CDC therefore recommends that people stay at home as much as possible, especially in areas with a pandemic.
The use of the term social distancing, in place of other alternatives to contacting others, has led to people becoming more likely to self-harm.
They recommend that you have sex with someone who is not infected with the virus or who has symptoms.
Those who are infected with COVID-19 and suspect that they may be infected with the virus are advised to stay at a friend's home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for quarantine. Many governments have mandated or mandated quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the disease.
The stronger self-quarantine guidelines have been announced for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently returned from a country with a high incidence of the disease are advised to quarantine at home for 14 days from the time of their last contact.
Measures to control the epidemic include containment and containment.
Flu suppression was introduced in the early stages of the disease as a measure to monitor and isolate infected individuals, and other measures to control infection and vaccines were introduced to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the virus is not contained, efforts are made to contain the spread, and measures are taken to prevent infection and reduce the impact on the health care system and the community.
They can work together using control and understanding.
The spread of the virus is below normal 1 and requires strict measures to eradicate the virus. Parts of its control include reducing the spread of the epidemic and preventing the spread of the disease.
This will allow more time for health services to develop vaccines and treatments, reducing the risk of over-service.
These measures include precautions that individuals can take such as hand washing, wearing masks and self-isolation, social distancing measures such as closing schools and public gatherings, and enforced sanitation.China has also taken measures such as city lockdowns and travel restrictions to slow the spread of the epidemic.
Other countries are also developing different guidelines to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed a mass cleanup and local quarantine, warning against the movement of individuals.
Singapore has offered financial support to those infected and quarantined while imposing heavy fines on those who do not.
Taiwan has imposed sanctions on medical supplies by increasing face mask products and by restricting medical supplies.The UK and US will face major challenges in developing guidelines for lockdowns (which will slow but not stop the spread of the epidemic) and lockdowns (which will keep the spread of the epidemic at bay).
Adequate prevention policies have reduced medical demand by two thirds and mortality by half.
Vaccinations may be necessary, but must continue until the virus is stopped from circulating within populations (unless a vaccine is available, if it has already arrived), because the outbreak can reoccur if restrictions are relaxed.
Measures to contain the epidemic can lead to social and economic disruption.
There is currently no effective antiviral drug for COVID-19, but clinical trials are underway to develop and test existing drugs.
Taking cold medications, taking fluids, and resting can alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the weight, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
Steroid use can impair the results.
The role of previously approved antiviral drugs for other viruses in treating COVID-19 is under investigation.
"The World Health Organization has stated that ""some traditional and home disinfectants"" may be involved in the production of SARS-CoV-19-induced symptoms".
WHO has identified capacity building and ensuring that healthcare facilities are fully adapted to the needs of COVID-19 patients as critical components of the response to the pandemic.
The ECDC and WHO Office in Europe issued guidelines for hospitals and healthcare facilities in Europe.The document summarizes how healthcare facilities can use their resources to provide laboratory services focused on COVID-19 testing, expand non-emergency surgery, isolate COVID-19 patients, increase intensive care capacity, and increase the number of beds and ventilators.
There is much speculation as to where the first patient (called Patient Zero) came from.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily declining.
These are associated with the Huanan fish and other animals.One would think that the virus evolved from these animals.Pneumonia cases were seen and treated in large numbers by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Hospital on December 26.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a coronavirus that resembles a smallpox virus.
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were punished by the police for spreading false rumors.
The Wuhan Health Commission Administration issued a public alert on 31 December and informed WHO.
In early January, enough cases of unidentified pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health officials to begin testing.In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases would have doubled in seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, helped by the Chinese New Year holiday, and Wuhan is a transportation hub and major railway junction.
On 20 January, China recorded almost 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to the latest official data, 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020. By March 26, the number of cases in the country had surpassed China and Italy. By April 9, 2020, there were more than 1.61 million cases worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cures.
There have been cases in nearly 200 countries and territories.
Many Schengen countries have restricted free movement in Europe due to the pandemic, and have put in place border controls.
As of April 2, approximately 300 million, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine.More than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India were vaccinated at home.
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people were under quarantine. Two days later, that number had risen to 2.6 billion - about one-third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Waters on 1 December 2019, although an unconfirmed report indicates the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a rare case of pneumonia on December 26, and her hospital reported the CDC to Wuhan and Jiangsu on December 27.
Genetic testing of patients on December 27, 2019 found SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the public statement was made by the Municipal Health Commissioner of Wuhan.
The World Health Organization (WHO) received the information on the same day.
"At the time of these statements, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police that they were "in a state of hysteria"".
The Chinese National Health Commission said it had not previously identified clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a crackdown on the virus, dubbed the ""People's War"" by then Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, aimed at controlling the virus".
"The "biggest outbreak in human history", described as a "dirty sanitation" that was declared on January 23, was a massive outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people".
The use of private cars was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations have been canceled in many places.
A temporary hospital called Huaoshan Hospital, built in 10 days, was completed, officials said.
A second hospital, Leichenshausen Hospital, was later built to increase patient capacity.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other public facilities, such as meeting rooms and stadiums in Wuhan, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government announced health declarations for travelers and the cancellation of the Spring Festival, among other measures that it said could help control the COVID-19 outbreak.
Universities and schools across the country are also closed.
Many Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken action, especially in relation to schools and universities.
In China, remote work measures have been introduced in limited areas.
Travel to and from Hubei has been banned.
Public transportation has been improved, and museums have been temporarily closed in China.
"Control of public movement is in place in most cities, and some 760 million people (about half the population) are subject to some form of outdoor restrictions. Before the pandemic hit the global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from ""spreading from other countries""".
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.On March 23, only one case of domestic transmission was detected in five days in mainland China, and it was a single person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the virus in the country would be halted and that the epidemic would be brought under control in China.
Except for Wuhan, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day after two months of lockdown, with the Chinese Foreign Ministry announcing on 26 March 2020 that all visa holders and residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, but did not provide details on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies and consulates.
The Chinese government has encouraged financial support to reopen factories and businesses on 30 March. A three-minute silence and a day of mourning was declared by the National Consulate at 10:00 a.m. on 4 April.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China on 20 January 2020.
The country's health agency reported a spike in confirmed cases of measles on February 20 due to a new religious gathering at Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu.
Worshippers from Xinjiang who have traveled to Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 or 13% of 9,336 churchgoers reported symptoms.South Korea declared a state of high alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea.
All South Korean military bases are under quarantine after three South Korean soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules have also been affected.South Korea has embarked on the world's largest and best-organized community-based virus screening and isolation effort, which seeks to isolate those infected and those in close contact with the infected.
The cleaning procedures are important for new international visitors, including mobile app-based signals detection, which results in a daily test of up to 20,000 vehicles with test results delivered the following day.
South Korea's plan to contain the epidemic is considered a success, despite the lack of a nationwide lockdown.
Several Koreans or government officials are holding a petition to blame Moon for the pandemic, praising the pandemic.
On March 23, South Korea reported the lowest daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that all new foreign visitors would be put into quarantine for two weeks, starting 1 April.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has been asked by 121 different countries to provide investigative assistance.
Iran announced the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kom on February 19, and two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
The government's previous measures included cancelling concerts and cultural events, Friday prayer schedules, and closing universities, colleges and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani announced on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine affected areas, but only individuals.
The inter-city travel restrictions were lifted in March, but heavy traffic flows between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
Shopping malls in the city will remain open to worshippers until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran was the epicenter of the outbreak, second only to China.
Following the suppression of the outbreak in Iran, more than a dozen countries reported cases to Iran on February 28, indicating that the spread of the outbreak was higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
Iran's parliament suspended its work.23 of its 290 members were confirmed to have the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to release without any preconditions those detained for peacefully expressing their dissent and to temporarily release all other detainees.
Closed facilities with inadequate medical care, such as prisons, are at greater risk of spreading the virus.
On March 15, Iran's health ministry reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the pandemic began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and officials, including ex-officio officials, were reported to have died from the disease on 17 March.
On 23 March, Iran reported 50 new cases and five new deaths per hour due to coronavirus.
The WHO official said the number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than the official figure.
In addition, the US sanctions on Iran are having a significant impact on the country's economic ability to contain the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called on Iran to ease economic sanctions on countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have entered Italy on 31 January after two Chinese tourists to Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
As cases began to rise rapidly, the Italian government declared a state of emergency, suspending all flights to China.
16 confirmed cases were detected in Lombardy on 21 February, followed by unrelated COVID-19 cases.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers passed a new decree to control the outbreak, which included 50,000 quarantines from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that "in the areas of the epidemic, entry and exit will not be bad".
"Suspicions of work-related and sporting activities in the area were taken into account"."On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country after 100 deaths were reported in the country. """
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were suspended for at least a month until April, except on March 9.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all business operations except supermarkets and pharmacies.On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published a medical practice manual on triage protocols that may be in use.
Italy surpassed China in the number of deaths from the pandemic after reporting 3,405 deaths on March 19.
On March 22, Russia announced that it would send nine military aircraft carrying medical supplies to Italy.
As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, with the highest number in Lombardy.
According to CNN, Italy's large demographic of people with dementia and the inability to quickly test all people with the virus are contributing to the high mortality rate.
The UK's initial response to the outbreak was described as lukewarm, with the Government of the United Kingdom not taking any measures to impose social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens until 18 March 2020.
As a result, the government has faced criticism for its lack of response and lack of transparency in the community.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson banned all non-essential travel and social contact, urging people to work from home as much as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues, including bars and gyms, should close as soon as possible, and to prevent unemployment during this difficult period, promised to pay workers 80% of their wages, up to a limit of £2,500.On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more restrictive measures and restrictions on social distancing, such as a ban on gatherings of more than two people, travel and outdoor activities.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions are enforced by the police force through fines and disruption of gatherings.
"Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those classified as ""essential"" such as supermarkets, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages".
On January 20, the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the Pacific Northwest of Washington in a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was convened on January 29.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include ways to produce antibodies that are effective in the response of the virus to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, as the coronavirus contains RNA.
This test is specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA and is only performed on cells.
Recent measurements have been used to confirm the activity of infection.
Antibody testing (serology) is useful for diagnosis and public surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those with very mild or no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the herd immunity rate are determined by the results of these tests.
With limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the disease in their populations as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and testing methods vary widely between countries.
This number also appears to have a significant impact on reported deaths, which are seen as being higher than estimates in some countries.
Using true reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed by a variety of methods, including samples from the respiratory system, nasopharyngeal swabs or a kidney sample.
Results will be provided within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test with a throat swab is reliable in the first week of the illness.
In severe cases, the virus can spread to the lungs and then disappear in the throat.
Infected individuals who have been tested in the second week, a suction catheter or a catheter (a catheter) may be used as a selective sample of material from the respiratory tract.

The FDA has approved the use of isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
These methods provide positive results in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, since no continuous heat exchangers are required.
Currently, 18,000 of these U.S. Abbott machines are expected to perform 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses monoclonal antibodies to bind to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan, and tests such as rapid influenza tests are expected to be performed in 15 to 20 minutes.
"A March 2020 literature review of ""oral cardiac radiographs have limited ability to detect disease in the early stages of the disease, but computed tomography can also prevent it before it causes symptoms""".
Common features seen in CT are a double multilobular hernia-like formation and a distal, asymmetrical posterior segmentation.
Subplural overgrowth, soil erosion and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
In a study comparing PCR and CT at the origin of the current Wuhan epidemic, CT was known to cause more disease than PCR, but it did not identify which disease was the worst, with most of its images being similar to pneumonia and other diseases.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology stated that ""CT scans should not be the primary treatment for COVID-19"" and as of March 2020, the CDC has recommended PCR scans as the primary treatment".
The immune system's response to the disease involves the production of IgM and IgG antibodies.
These are used to detect the infection within 7 days or so of the onset of symptoms, to confirm immunity, and to monitor the population at large.Testing is performed in a central laboratory (CLT) or point-of-care (PoCT) test.
High-speed automated systems can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, but their presentation may be supported by a separate system manual.
Although serial samples are used to monitor immune response, CLT is usually used to sample blood free.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually taken by injection into the skin.
Pre-testing is not required for extraction measures such as PCR methods.On March 26, 2020, 29 companies that notified the agency were asked by the FDA to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval for their test kits, which use IgG and IgA to identify antibodies to the virus produced in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours, making it much faster than the conventional viral RNA PCR test.
These antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the infection.In early April, the UK confirmed that antibody kits sold by the UK were not suitable for use.
"Hong Kong has developed a system where suspected people can stay at home, ""providing the patient with a sample tube from the emergency room"" and the results will be known later.The British NHS has announced that it will launch a home treatment system for suspected cases, and healthcare providers will take appropriate precautions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the car, as well as in-car testing of suspected cases, and other preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus when patients arrive at the hospital or when ambulances carry patients".
Road testing facilities have allowed South Korea to perform the fastest and most accurate tests of any country in the world.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance in Germany announced on March 2 that the healthcare profession will be able to perform 12,000 tests per day via mobile devices, with 10,700 tests to be performed in the coming weeks.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, vehicle inspections have been conducted in many cities.
There are no known cases of testing in Germany as of 26 March 2020, as only positive tests are being reported.
"The first laboratory trial began in the calendar week of 12/2020 and a total of 483,295 samples were tested by 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) showing positive results for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion tested a method that allowed simultaneous testing of samples from 64 patients at Rambam Hospital and the Technion, which allowed samples to be tested only if the recovered samples were positive.The newly opened 2,000-sq-square-foot water-based laboratory ""Yan-Huo"" (Chinese: 火眼, or ""Fire Eye"" by Chinese: 火眼) opened on February 5, 2020, with more than 10,000 samples tested in China".
The building took five days to complete, according to BGI-founder Wang Jian.Without this testing capacity, Hubei's cases would have been 47% higher than the current one and could have doubled without surveillance and quarantine.
The Wuhan laboratory was followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
On 4 March 2020, daily tests averaged 50,000 tests per day.According to the source, a design by Origami Tests would allow only 93 tests of more than 1,122 COVID-19 patient samples to be tested.These standardized designs could be performed in small labs without the help of robotic fluidized controllers.
In March, the EU remained under great pressure to conduct more tests for UK and US reagent deficiencies and inadequacies.
This has led some authors to review sample preparation protocols, including the use of a 5-minute boiling of RNA genomes at 98 °C (208 °F) for better testing.On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates reported that it had the largest population tested for coronavirus of any country, and the largest population tested for the virus.
"The in-car service, population scale and BGI (based on China's ""Huo-Yan"" randomized controlled trial) are a collaboration from the Group 42 Laboratory".
Built in 14 days, the lab can perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests in a day, the first time it has been used outside China.
Several tests comparing the genetic makeup of the coronavirus have been ordered in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved German kits exported to low-income countries that cannot produce them themselves.
The German vaccine was released on 17 January 2020, and testing was delayed because the U.S. disease control protocol was not available until 28 January.China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand by medical professionals.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's widespread testing supply has slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, largely in private laboratories, have been developed over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for testing programs to be effective in reducing COVID-19.Despite the widespread spread of the virus, hundreds of thousands of private tests have been conducted at U.S. laboratories, and testing questions are being raised as the supply of swabs and chemical reagents dwindles.
In March 2020, China reported a problem of inaccuracies in its test kits.
"In the United States, testing kits developed by the CDC had ""problems"" and the government then lifted bureaucratic restrictions that barred private testing of drugs.Spain purchased test kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, which confirmed that their results were not safe".
The agency said these inaccurate results could be due to problems with sampling or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry of Health has removed the test kits that produced false results, saying it is using other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of these test kits imported from China by the Czech Republic have given false results.Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million kits from China and found them to be contaminated.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that it be thrown into the Danube.Ateş Kara, the Turkish Health Ministry, said that the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and were "not used".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020 but said they were not ready for use".
Testing, quarantine and follow-up of people with positive SARS-CoV-2 results are showing positive results.
In the Italian city of Vò, Italy's first COVID-19 death zone, researchers conducted two rounds of testing on 3,400 people, with a ten-day gap.
Almost half of the positive cases are asymptomatic, and all confirmed cases have been excluded.
By preventing travel to the coma, this can prevent new infections.
With strict lockdowns, travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic was relatively mild in Singapore compared to other developed countries, with restaurants and retailers closing unnecessarily.
Most schedules were canceled, and Singapore began requiring residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time on 23 March after the holiday break.
Several other countries have managed to contain the pandemic with strict surveillance, travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, but with non-essential lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Countries with more testing than death rates have lower mortality rates, statistically, because they can distinguish between people with mild and no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have the testing capacity and have national laboratories with experience in COVID-19 testing should send the initial five positive and ten negative COVID-19 test results to the 16 WHO referral laboratories.
Of the 16 test sites, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the percentage of positive tests is determined by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients has a higher percentage of positive tests than all of its citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms, while all other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from them.
"Washing your hands with soap during ""critical periods"" of the day reduces the risk of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, because they are diseases that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route".
People can also contract respiratory diseases, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five most important times of the day to wash your hands with soap are before and after you take a shower, after you wash your baby's nappy or change her diaper, before feeding your baby, before eating and before cooking, and before preparing raw meat, fish, and milk.
If you cannot get soap and water, you can wash your hands with a warm cloth.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
Splashing of used baby diapers after changing or cleaning.
Sneezing, sneezing, or sneezing behind your nose.
After touching, feeding, or handling animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or receiving medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The primary health purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or illness.
This is especially true for those who handle food or who work in the medical field, and it is also beneficial to the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the spread of infectious agents; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reducing the mortality rate of home births.
A 2013 study found that frequent handwashing practices led to minor improvements in height problems in children under five years of age.
In tropical countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and respiratory diseases can be reduced by identifying simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action reduces the mortality from the disease by 50%.
Enhanced handwashing practices reduce sitting times by three, comparable to providing sanitation in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap plays a major role in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases by 48%.Washing hands with soap and water is the safest and most effective way to prevent common infections of the respiratory tract in the home, workplace and community.
Pneumonia, a severe ARI, is the number one killer of children under five years old, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, handwashing with soap and water before and after meals and using the toilet more often than vaccines and treatments saves lives, halves communicable diseases and reduces deaths from severe respiratory diseases by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene activities such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against infectious diseases that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The small critical effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing dries the skin and can lead to skin rashes.
A 2012 Danish study found that frequent hand washing can lead to eczema, dry skin eczema or hand dermatitis, which are common among healthcare workers.
Washing your hands frequently is considered a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five main times of day to wash hands to reduce the risk of infection from the bite and mouth: after using the toilet (after chewing and flossing), after wiping the baby's diaper (after changing nappies), before feeding children, before eating and before/after preparing food or raw meat, fish, or milk.
Handwashing techniques should also be used in other situations to prevent infection, including before and after treating a wound; after you breathe, swallow, or run your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, low handwashing rates with soap and water are common.
A 2015 handwashing survey in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households use soap-based bathroom soap.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, the United States was near the midpoint at 77%, and China had a lower rate of 23%.
"The ""Determinative Health Care Program"" implemented by the Department of Education is an example of the scale of action taken in the Philippines to strengthen children's health and education".
Repeatedly twice a year, daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride brushing are the main objectives of this national program.
It has also been successfully used in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is facilitated by dissolving them in soap and detergents.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the concentration of detergents and increase their effectiveness.
Water alone is not a good detergent, because fats and proteins, the building blocks of life, cannot be washed away by water alone.
Cleanup, however, is supported by reasonable water resources.
Dry soaps, by their reusable nature, can retain bacteria from the last use.
Many studies have found that the spread of bacteria from contaminated soil is low because the bacteria are destroyed by the soil.
"The CDC has so far said ""it is preferable to use liquid soap without touching your hands""".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily recommended by health-conscious populations.
To date, there is no evidence to support the use of these recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for naturally antibiotic resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains tolerate.
Therefore, antibiotic-resistant strains may not be as effective as desired, even if they are not selected by the antibacterial soap.
Along with the skin-protective agent, this complex formulation may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH stabilizers, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (alloy vera, vitamins, methanol, and plant extracts).
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective at removing natural oils that contain bacteria than cold, soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water is not helpful in reducing the number of microbes on the hands.
Hand sanitizers or hand antiseptics are hand sanitizers that do not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizer intermediates (alcoholic hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most isopyl alcohols or ethanol are mixed with a solvent such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) and gelled, or are humidifiers such as glycerin liquid, or are made into a powder to reduce the oxidation effect of the alcohol.
The use of hydrogen peroxide in the wash increases the antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol-containing sanitizers kill bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) as well as fungi.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants contain 70% alcohol 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) and kill 99.99% of bacteria in 30 seconds and 99.999% of bacteria (4 to 5 na log reduction) in 1 minute after applying to your hands.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers against Norwalk virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Wash your hands with enough hand antiseptic or alcohol to keep them clean or both hands clean.
Both hands should be rubbed against the front and back of the hand and the middle fingers of the hand for up to 30 seconds with the liquid, powder or gel.
Fingertips should be washed thoroughly, with both hands covered with a cloth.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing over sanitiser platforms, especially if your hands are exposed to dirt.
The main advantage of these agents is that they are easy to use and kill microorganisms quickly; however, they should not be substituted for proper hand washing if soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin, so disinfectants and/or skin filters should be added to the formula.
The oxidative effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other contaminants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing sanitizers contained toxicity and had a lower risk of skin irritation and corrosion compared to soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic dermatitis, urethritis syndrome and hypersensitivity to alcohol are also associated with increased risk of alcohol-containing additives being left in the hand.
Comparison with washing with soap and water to reduce the risk of developing irritant skin dermatitis.
Regardless of their effectiveness, non-water-based hand sanitizers cannot disinfect organic material, only disinfect it.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the transmission of many pathogens, as pathogens are more likely to be on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation, and have historically been seen as inferior to alcohol-free hand sanitizers.
In recent times, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and consistent antimicrobial activity against alcohol, but its effectiveness has decreased after repeated use, possibly due to a skin side effect.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap, so they use soap or dust instead.
Using a soap or dust cleaner is better than using water alone, but less effective than soap.
The dust or mud is not a threat to the spread of the virus, but to the spread of microorganisms, which can reduce its spread.
A disinfectant agent that combines soap, soap and water to create an alkaline stain.
The World Health Organization suggests that we can use soap as a substitute for soap in healthcare settings where soap is unavailable.
Proper handwashing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control include the following measures to reduce the spread of the disease:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Running water is recommended because stationary tanks can contaminate it, the temperature of the water makes no difference.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including your hands, your palms, between your fingers, and under your pillow.
Soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash with soap more often than with water alone.
If it is dry, rinse it for 20 seconds.
Hand scrubbing creates a diffuse layer, helping to remove germs from your skin, and long-term scrubbing eliminates many germs.
Wash hands with running water.
Washing hands in a bathtub can be unsightly.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or dry them with dry air.
Cheap, dirty hands are easily damaged. The most commonly forgotten parts of the hands are the thumb, wrist, between the fingers, and inside the palm.
Artificial inks and dye-staining inks can contain microorganisms.
Hand lotion is recommended to prevent dry hands when dry skin increases the risk of transmission of disease.
"Various low-cost options for water and/or soap can be offered to enhance handwashing when not available, for example, by copying or taping water from a tap of jericho and/or using a heater if necessary in tropical countries.
Tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a strap-on jog, and can be applied by rubbing a small amount of soap and water into your hands with your feet.
Proper hand sanitization is an essential part of hand hygiene, but hand sanitization in public toilets is controversial.
Several studies suggest that paper towels are more efficient than electric handheld platforms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Soft Paper Towel Manufacturers Symposium, comparing the hygiene performance of paper towels with the performance of modern, hot-air hand-held JET platforms.
Washing and drying hands in a warm, dry environment reduced overall bacterial counts in the fingertips by 194% and in the palms of the hands by 254%.
The overall average bacterial mortality rate for hand rubbing with a jet wash is 42% on the fingertips and 15% on the palms.
After washing your hands with a paper towel, the overall bacterial concentration decreased by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms of the hands.
The jet-air dryer, which expels air from the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), lifts microorganisms from the hands and seals other toilet areas, and is capable of contaminating the toilet area up to 2 meters in diameter.
Warm air from hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the surface.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt showed a different method of hand drying.
The following changes in bacterial abundance have been observed after hand rubbing:
There are many different manufacturers of hand towels, and hand towels have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with a soft turquoise sanitizer is recommended when soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis proved its suitability to prevent the spread of disease in hospital environments (in 1846).
There are electronic devices to remind hospital staff to wash their hands.
One study found a decreased infection rate with their use.
Wash your hands in any area of the body using plenty of soap and water or gel, which is recommended for 15 seconds if medical.
Hands should be held together and fingers should be crossed.
If there is debris under your fingertips, you can remove it with a brush.
It is important to rinse and rinse hands with a dry towel as germs can remain in the water on your hands.
After washing, use the paper towel to wash off the water (preferably with a closed door if necessary).
This will help your hands to avoid contaminating the areas.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to prevent the spread of germs and to prevent them from spreading to others.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, handwashing is unacceptable, and many doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other gentle procedures can reduce catheter-related blood vessel infections by 66 percent.
The incomplete hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the organizations can be found for public viewing on their websites.
This was reviewed by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment may display and display hand hygiene, if required by law.
"The World Health Organization has a ""five-season"" rule for hand washing".
After a blood or body fluid is drained
Before the illness, work, and
"After patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (""medicinal"" or ""anti-microbial"" soaps) acts as a disinfectant for hand washing".
Such lethal action can be used before surgery or in most situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are present. A 'hand dressing' is necessary for the surgical procedure, a disposable hand wash, and some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for hand drying, sterile towels for the washing of other sterile items and underwear.
All the corners should be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands to the corners, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wait for a long time (10 minutes).
If the upper part of the hand is wet, care should be taken to prevent water from getting into the hands.
After washing your hands thoroughly, wash your hands with a sterile dry towel and remove your surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is good to wash your hands before and after contacting someone who is sick or to use antiseptic.
In the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand hygiene was found in the first 20% of people who washed their hands, and the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35%.
Washing with regular soap is more than three times more likely to transmit bacterial infections to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Washing with alcohol-based hand soap for 30 seconds reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to using antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water from alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are better at removing H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from hands.Hand hygiene in healthcare settings can include teaching staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
More studies are needed to determine which of these treatments are the best.
In tropical countries, handwashing with soap is considered a vital tool for good health, as is good nutrition.
However, the lack of access to water, soap or handwashing equipment at home, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop global handwashing practices.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand-washing tapes in communal areas, even with the help of a self-service toilet.
However, low handwashing rates are the result of inadequate practice, not a lack of soap and water.
The emphasis on handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and create long-term handwashing habits in the population.
Control and monitoring are essential for this to work properly.
"Systematic reviews of 70 studies have shown that local handwashing approaches are better in LMICs, while social market approaches are not. "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF provides simple, simple steps for schools to encourage students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene products".
If a lower standard is met, schools can be awarded one to three stars.
The construction of hand toilets can be a catalyst for handwashing campaigns to reduce the incidence of disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is a campaign to try to bring about change in behavior. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus, UNICEF has encouraged the creation of handwashing emojis.
One study evaluated the overall external effectiveness of handwashing in tropical countries in relation to the cessation of DALYs.
However, one reviewer found that handwashing with soap is more cost-effective compared to other water and sanitation methods.
"The health benefits of hand washing for people  especially vulnerable people such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  were first identified in the mid-19th century by two founders of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of Vienna, Austria and Florence Englen, the English ""founder of modern cosmetics""".
At the time, many people believed that infections were caused by a poisonous insect called myasmosis.
In 1980, foodborne epidemics and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote improved hand hygiene as a primary means of preventing infection.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with the words ""proper hand washing techniques"" are hung next to public toilets and sinks and are also found at the entrance offices and at German airports".
"The idiom ""wash your hands before they get dirty"" implies a reluctance to take responsibility for the usefulness of anything".
The term "Pontius Pilate washed his hands" is taken from the Gospel of Matthew, but it is widely used in English society.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands vigorously to clear her guilt over her crime and the crime she encouraged her husband to commit.
People wash their hands more often than others if they remember or think about doing something disorderly, and they value hand sanitizer more than others.
"Also, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such an act have a limited ability to perform other "cleansing"" ritualistic acts, such as volunteering".
The ritual of hand washing, which involves washing hands with soap and water, is a practice of many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Tevilah and Netilat, Yadaim, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing, with some exceptions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prohibit washing hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam encourage washing hands before eating.
COVID-19 workplace risk management
COVID-19 workplace risk control means the adoption of workplace safety and risk control measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and type of work, the source of exposure risk, the severity of the environment of the disease, and the risk factors for people who are at high risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with low exposure risk are those with low exposure to the public or workers, and basic prevention measures include hand washing, keeping workers home if sick, respiratory procedures, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate-risk occupations include those that require repeated exposure to people who have been in direct or confirmed contact with COVID-19, but may be affected by ongoing community pandemics or international travel.
This includes workers who work with general population densities such as schools, high-density workplaces, and some high-density retail outlets.
Risk management team, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, recommended that anyone who is infected with COVID-19 use ventilation fans, masks and personal protective equipment.
OSHA reports that healthcare and funeral workers who are exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are at higher risk if they perform aerosol testing, or collect samples of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Risk management for these workers also includes engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment for the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a wide range of impacts on the workplace.
Employees may miss work because they are sick, need to care for others, or fear losing their jobs.
Business processes can be modified in two ways, with regard to the availability of goods and the way in which they are obtained (such as shopping at unusual hours or getting services in your car).
Finally, travel from countries most affected by COVID-19 can be halted.Infectious disease preparedness and response measures can help to prevent infections.
The guidelines identify the risk parameters associated with workplaces and workplaces, including sources of exposure, home and community settings, and the level of risk factors associated with individual workers, such as ageing or medical conditions.
To control the potential for situations during the outbreak, the authorities have put in place measures to identify the risks and public plans.
Infectious disease preparedness and response is subject to national and subnational advice.
The objectives of pandemic response include reducing the spread among staff, caring for people who are vulnerable to costly adverse health effects, maintaining business operations, and mitigating potential adverse impacts on the supply chain.
The location of the business affects the severity of the disease response.
Pre-processed risk management is often associated with healthcare operations and is the basis for group risk management operations up to a critical stage.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the best are engineering controls, continuous administrative controls, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls are the most cost-effective solution to protect workers from work-related hazards without affecting the personal character of the employee.
Administrative controls are changes in policy in the workplace or production that require action by the employee or manager.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less expensive than engineering and management controls, but some protective coverage can be useful.
All personal protective equipment must be designed in such a way as to ensure that it is in accordance with the requirements of the risk assessment procedure (e.g. respirator), is in continuous operation, is regularly inspected, repaired, replaced, is properly removed if necessary, is kept clean, and is properly installed and removed to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with low exposure risk have a low risk of exposure to the general public and employers.
Basic disinfection measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing with soap and water, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory rules such as wearing respiratory coverings and a mask, providing soap and garbage disposal, extending a high-shift system for telecommunications where necessary, making employees avoid using other people's products and equipment, and maintaining daily hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of infected individuals for workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace is a critical step in preventing the disease.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with severe respiratory problems stay home for up to 24 hours without fever, fever symptoms, or any other symptomatic medications, and that sick leave policies be in place to ensure that employees are able to stay home to treat a family member who is ill, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, vulnerable occupations are people with jobs that require them to be within six feet (1.8 m) of people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through community transmission in business premises, or who have traveled to countries with a high COVID-19 outbreak.
This includes workers who need to be replaced in general, such as schools, high-density workplaces, and some areas with high sales volumes.These include groups with higher exposure to this type of resistance and engineering controls to meet high-quality air pollution standards, increasing ventilation rates, physical restrictions such as plain plastic building insulation and feeding, and opening and closing windows for people who are in their cars and have access to services.The development of education and administrative training for groups with higher exposure to this type of resistance requires that the design of sites and the management of sites and the maintenance of facilities should be addressed in a comprehensive manner, including by providing public safety information on COVID-19 safety practices, providing personal safety equipment for workers to avoid exposure to COVID-19, and by providing protection for workers who are unable to travel, work, buy or use personal protective equipment, and other workplace hazards such as safety, security, safety, and security, and by providing personal protective equipment for workers who are unable to travel, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, and walk, and use safety equipment, and equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
These vulnerable workers do not need to use respirators as much.
If someone becomes ill on the plane, appropriate controls for the safety of the crew and passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, providing a mask to the sick person and covering the mouth and nose with a soft cloth during urination.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or when visiting a location where body fluids may be contaminated; personal protective equipment should also be used if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or respiratory problems.
Gloves and other items that can be used to remove dirt should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected.This includes commercial shipping, cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk management, delaying travel if you are sick, isolating your friends, and identifying medical personnel on board if anyone on board has a fever or other symptoms.
In principle, medical check-ups should be performed in the child's isolation cabin.The CDC recommends that schools and child care facilities remain closed until the child is cleaned and disinfected, regardless of social distancing, if the sick person is in the school building.
Where there is low or moderate community distribution, physical distancing measures should be implemented, such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings such as fitness classes or choir classes or serving meals in the cafeteria; widening the gap between neighborhoods, setting entry and exit times; reducing non-essential visitors; and using a special medical facility for children with symptoms such as flu.
If there is an outbreak in local communities, schools may be closed for extended periods of time in addition to social distancing measures.Law enforcement officials are required to carry out daily activities, and the direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement agencies that may have to provide medical care to people who have been confirmed to have suspected COVID-19 should follow the same standard of care, including a medical device.
In the event of an emergency close call, workers should clean and disinfect their emergency belts and equipment with household detergent spray or wipes before re-use, and use standard guidelines for storing and disposing of used PPE and laundry.
OSHA reports that some health care and funeral workers are at higher risk of contracting the flu.
Jobs with a high risk of infection include health care providers, assistants, laboratory and medical transportation personnel with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients who are susceptible.
The workers are particularly vulnerable if they are conducting aerosol tests, or taking samples from suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol dispensers include intubation procedures, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental treatments and tests, or invasive sampling.
Funeral services with a high risk of infection are for people who prepare the bodies of people suspected or confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19, who are more likely to be infected if they undergo autopsy.In addition, engineering controls include the isolation of those confirmed or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, and aerosol spraying.
Specialised negative ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and funeral facilities.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to the clinic and are not suspected COVID-19 patients be isolated and kept in a separate waiting area.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work within 6 feet of known and suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, including those who work in aerosol testing facilities.
In the United States, NIOSH-licensed face masks with N95 filters or better are used in a general, written respiratory protection program, including adequate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other respirators offer better protection and better worker comfort.WHO does not recommend full face masks, as COVID-19 is not transmitted through body fluids but is a respiratory disease.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for people undergoing medical examinations.
People who take, store, or transport respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol testing recommend the use of surgical masks, goggles, or face masks, gloves, and gloves.
If aerosol samples are to be tested, surgical masks should be replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
With insufficient global supply of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, using physical isolation as a transparent mirror, allowing only those who provide direct care to people with COVID-19, continuing to use PPE only when necessary for specific work, and continuing to use it when caring for multiple patients with the same disease, limiting and coordinating the supply chain of PPE, and encouraging the use of masks for people with no symptoms.

The Winnipeg Line: [COVID-19] Preparing for the future by highlighting the challenges
The date/time of the hunt is March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC.
License granted: CC0 No rights reserved
This month we have found ourselves in a difficult situation.
This is a clear indication of our global partnership and responsibilities as we face the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have no precedent for his promises. But we know that our main response to global compassion, cooperation and community building is to create a heart of this organization.
The friendship and interaction we have seen through email, calls and chat among our clients is proof that they are amazing people with whom we have had the opportunity to work.
I am very proud to count you all as my fellow workers.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to subscribe to Wikipedia in this day and age, and that this vital online help is a powerful sign that it is available to everyone.
This will make your work more successful, keep these sites running, or make our partners pay, or keep our community safer.
The world needs Wikipedia, more than ever.
It is time to make a meaningful impact on the world, not just on what we do, but on how we do it.
"Thanks to your commitment to this mission, we will be making some significant changes to our operations starting next week".
I was a pioneer in the United States.
As Robyn said earlier, this c-team met to discuss our operations and plan for the next few months and months.
In this discussion, we considered what we thought was the response to the current situation and what we need to do to ensure the sustainability of the organization in the meantime.
We wanted to help out in our assignment for a long time, but we were so anxious.
If you want to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations are 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not a party to announce - if you can work overtime, this assignment can be useful to you.
However, the world is a tough place to eat right now, and whether it's taking care of loved ones, shopping for groceries, or going to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We are not in control of your time
Do not go to work if you are sick.
This is something that can be understood without saying it, but we are saying it.
Need sick days or PTO - Tell your manager and help your team keep a calendar and plan to make sure the workplaces are occupied.
(If you are COVID-19 positive, let Bryan know about T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you get help and your condition can be addressed by management.)
Workers will be paid full time.
We will honor our commitments to our contractors and our hourly staff.
Everyone is paid according to the hours worked under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill and unable to go to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stress of this world.
Our work can be very rewarding, especially in such a time.
Even now, it's about taking care of your spouse.
We ask that you speak to your manager so that we can know what to expect and prepare.
Some tasks are classified as essential.
There are a few things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fund Liaison Teams (among others) are doing critical work that requires additional support.
We are going to start to focus on meeting the objectives of this time and helping the core of our mission.
We all have a lot to do, and we're going to look at the most urgent projects.
It never hurts to slow down now.
We are not planning to double our travel after the pandemic.
You were not expected to work overtime to meet the hourly limit.
Accept that things have changed, and work to set new goals and deadlines if necessary.
What happens to the APP (Annual Report)?
To adapt to our new environment and maintain our daily working hours, we are considering extending our 2020-2021 annual deadline.
Our goal is to propose a 2019-2020 plan that will allow employees enough time to prioritize critical work, care for their families, and loved ones, and to identify those who want to work on a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadline significantly reduces the workload and pressures of this period across the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and, once approved, we will update it with respect to delegates and groups for further action.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership.
The office environment, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, due to the need for caution, an anti-virus team has been called in to disinfect the premises of the San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade disinfectant to disinfect all contact areas, including the lobby and elevator backs to the hospital.
The building is counting on its own security personnel to provide security support to its employees.
We are confident that our office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, and we have shared its COVID-19 protocols with all DC-based staff.
Starting last week, our DC office has implemented full-length preparations with guidance from the San Francisco Shire.
We were talking about hiring a location in Brooklyn, as were some of our NYC-based partners.
These talks are ongoing but may be too late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
They believe that our long-range spacecraft are a failure, and they would like to offer some advice:
The length of the morning sessions should not exceed two hours
If long-term plans are needed, consider how they can be broken down over a period of days.
Make a list of meetings, make an agenda, and send out reading material in advance.
Set this video to default, to allow live connections and communication with Google Docs and Zoom.
You have instructions for each meeting, someone to monitor the chat and monitor the list of speakers, and anyone to take notes (or share notes).
If you need a silent headset, email tech support.
Use your security deposit to feed your family.
Updated to #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about the activities broadcast on Slack
This HR operations team is monitoring webinar-based ergonomics to help with the Foundation-wide expansion.
Last week, we asked all Wikimedia communities to suspend public events such as editathons until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand that this request for withdrawal or other restrictions make it impossible to obtain the licensed products we have agreed to and we would like to inform them that no one will be penalized for delaying or improving these products.
We will be following Wikimania's updates and other regional and thematic community conferences next week.
A global community of compassion and compassion, and a sense of relief that people can focus on their own communities, Wikimedia or elsewhere.
In addition, CRT is working to create a Meta-Wiki page to provide a place for the community to monitor its activity and monitor our interactions with them.
Being aware of COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and make time to meet in person.
We are in this together and we need to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive this information via email, as well as other important COVID-19-related information, on the Office Wiki.
CRT keeps these pages updated and all this information in one place.
We are working to maintain contact with staff in countries that are experiencing severe drought.
If you need assistance with travel, preparations, major business trips, or coverage, or anything else, please do not be afraid to apply to and work with CRT.
We are here to provide assistance and assistance as needed.
If you have a confidential or embarrassing matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
These changes should not be seen as limiting our work and responsibilities.
In fact, they suggest that our work and responsibilities today need to change in a way that is very different from the way we have done in the past.
These are steps that we believe can help us help ourselves and work together, provide the support we need for our movement, and help the world with their support.
Our work done yesterday will continue until the time comes.
From now on, we will help each other and create the groundwork for the important work we will do next week and in the months ahead.
I expect all of you to work for this to happen, so I want you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can find yourself fit and healthy when the demands change.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership teams (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b-Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the blood vessels of the lungs, heart, kidney and spleen.
ACE2 counters the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the size of angiotensin-II and increasing the angiotransferase (ACE1-7) levels, making it a promising drug for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human nucleic acid is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found in the endothelial and other blood vessels of cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collector and renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with a white translucent membrane, which is a major active site of the enzyme, targeting the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Outside the cell, the ACE2 domain is cut from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shades, and the resulting protein is transported to the blood vessels and then eliminated by the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is particularly associated with lung type II alveolar cells, small intestinal endothelial cells, arteriovenous endothelial cells, arterial lymphatic cells and the cell membranes of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The first service of ACE2 is to prescribe ACE.
ACE, the angiotensin I hormone, releases angiotensin II into the bloodstream.
ACE2 in turn separates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can synthesize various peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the blockade of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and has also been linked to heart attack.
As a protein marker, ACEI 2 is the main reference point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 influenza virus).
Specifically, the spike of SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV2 proteins is caused by the binding of the ACE2 enzyme domain in the bloodstream of the cells to induce induction and translocation of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes of the cell.
This process requires TMPRSS2, a carrier serine protease, to inhibit S protein prime. Blocking this protein is being studied as a therapeutic.
However, many experts and regulators recommend that a standard ACE inhibitor be used for treatment of ARB.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that ""the use of ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of developing pneumonia by 34% compared to controls""".
"Moreover, ""the risk of developing pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at risk of developing severe pneumonia, especially in those at risk of stroke and heart failure"."
Although the results were not as good as the reduction in pneumonia, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a decrease in deaths from pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury, and has been shown to improve pulmonary hypothyroidism and oxygen saturation in infants with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours, and the duration of the course of effect is approximately 30 minutes.
Multiple discoveries of rhACE2 may be promising treatments for people who do not respond to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) in patients with high levels of angiotensin II.Implanted rhACE2 has been validated in clinical trials to treat severe respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 apps are a mobile phone-based information system for monitoring and tracking contagious disease transmission in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. a process of isolating people who may have been in close contact with an infected individual.
In some states and jurisdictions, many applications have been banned or removed with official government assistance.
Many applications have been developed to help monitor contacts.
A system based on geographically based monitoring of security threats, especially by users
Less convenient options for using signals to connect a user to other Bluetooth mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google announced that it was working with Apple to integrate its Bluetooth-based app directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has implemented an app that will let citizens know if they have been in contact with a COVID-19 infected person.
It is being used in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, an app called Trace_Tugether is being used.
"This app was developed by the local IT community and is available to the public. North Macedonia launched a Bluetooth-based application called ""StopKorona!"".
The app is developed by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Communications Technology.
The app was expected to be approved by the Google Play Store and Apple Store by April 14, 2020.
On April 12, the government announced that the communications tracker had delayed the development of the app and was about to roll it out in a matter of weeks.Similar applications are being planned in Ireland and France to develop (COVID-19).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using an app based on the BlueTrace protocol, the Singaporean TraceTogether app.Russia will launch a geofencing app for confirmed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they stay indoors.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed several practical problems associated with application-based systems, including false positive results and the potential for efficiency loss associated with the use of the application in a small segment of the population.
"To combat the spread of ""coronavirus"" apps that provide misleading or harmful information, Apple has restricted the number of organizations that can upload coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, allowing only ""public"" or trusted organizations".
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
The risk of the coronavirus is highlighted by the use of low-level development to establish infectious diseases after the coronavirus, especially after the disease has passed.
Amnesty International has issued a statement calling for more than 100 other organisations to impose restrictions on these types of surveillance.
The organization has issued eight conditions for government projects:
The monitoring should be legal, substantive and proportionate.
Control and surveillance cameras require the inclusion of a backwash.
Data use will be limited to COVID-19.
The security and confidentiality of information must be maintained and maintained in the context of the Markov Act.
Digital resilience must eliminate disparities and biases:
Sharing any data with third parties is legally binding;
The rights of citizens to defend against and respond to these interests must be protected;
"Significant participation from all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and private groups, is required. The German CCS Computer Laboratory and Reporters Without Borders RSF have also issued a checklist".
The upcoming Google/Apple update aims to address the ongoing security problem by removing this monitoring and surveillance method from their devices when it is no longer necessary.
Some apps use location-based networking methods based on country of use, which is useful for reducing the chances of app downloads and subsequent removal.
Network-based monitoring is approved in Israel.
A web-based solution that can access local data has a significant security problem.
However, all systems with a central server have a private local access point, and many have a freeware system only for connecting central servers (see also section below).
In South Korea, an out-of-app system was used to monitor the movement of coconuts.
With the use of a dedicated app, advanced mobile tracking and map tracking with separate sources, these individual text messages are sent to patients.
In addition to alerting people to potential vulnerabilities, the government made the location information available to the public, allowing for a change in information policy following the country's MERS outbreak.
This information is available on various websites and apps. Countries such as Germany also use a centralized privacy-protection system.
No lists have been released as of April 6, 2020.
A legal process to ensure that people who have had contact with a patient are kept safe was launched in 2013 by a small research team.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts have been using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to track how close a user is to other phones to use a security-safe solution.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort with a centralized and decentralized approach, and is not a shadow protocol.Non-centralized protocols include privacy-protecting submissions monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary substitution numbers (TCN, fka substitution numbers, CEN), personal vulnerability protocols and mobile substitution monitoring (PACT), and others from the central distribution.
Under these protocols, no personal information is transferred from the device and all interception is done on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing a secure way to quickly detect the spread of COVID-19 by collecting and using privacy-preserving techniques to collect and use data from the path intersection of the data.
"It is based on research from the whitepaper ""The Best App for Keeping Privacy Safe During a Pandemic"" and was published in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTres Platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company at the MIT Media Lab".
Safe:Trace users will share private addresses and study status with Calot users and employees without risk.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups of like-minded approaches and interoperable protocols, with the aim of reducing disruption and working together to create a global monitoring and detection platform, a key to a widely distributed network.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the official release of the Bluetooth protocol used by the government's app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communications monitoring initiative based on low-power Bluetooth technology and cryptographic storage security, which they said protects privacy.
They also illuminated key technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be rolled out in three phases.
Tools for governments to create privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking apps
This process is directly linked to the OS, Android, Google and Apple, by updating the system via the operating system, and then removing the system in the same way to identify any further problems and to identify any future problems.
b'Drug re-use (also known as re-purposing, re-profiling, re-purposing or drug conversion) refers to the use of a drug approved to treat another disease or health condition for another disease.
This is currently a line of scientific research to monitor the development of effective and safe COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convoluted plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drug-like proteins, each with multiple ligand receptor sites.
The study of the transcriptional sites provides a realistic plan for the development of an effective drug against COVID-19 proteases.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are the papine-type protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein, AA et al. studied several compounds and then developed a highly recognized antiretroviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical trials and added design to the clinical trial.
Chloroquine is used as an anti-malarial drug and for some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs approved as part of clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state of New York will begin testing chloroquine for hydroxychloroquine on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and is only approved as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized in clinical trials but cannot receive treatment under emergency authorization.
The CDC says it has not yet been established whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Doctors have recommended using the drug when there is no other option.
A small study in Istanbul by a Turkish research group is on the use of chloroquine with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting safety and efficacy trials for the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials have shown favipiravir to be ""clearly effective"" in Wuhan and Shenzhen".
In Shenzhen, 35 people were declared free of the virus in 4 days, while 45 people who did not have the virus were in illness for 11 days.
A study in water was conducted in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom were treated with favipiravir and half with umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminds the public that the current evidence supporting the drug is preliminary and insufficient.
On March 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan and use the military to distribute it to university hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Post, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump administration to buy the drug.The drug may not be effective in severe cases because the virus is so widespread.
It may be unsafe for women who are trying to conceive while breastfeeding.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (CALETRA) concluded that the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir had both benefits.
These drugs can prevent HIV from spreading by binding to the prosthesis.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to improve drugs to create compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community that drugs developed exclusively for HIV/AIDS are using resources for other purposes.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in a global strength trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to prevent Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity against a variety of phylloxera, pneumococcal, maramyx, and coronavirus viruses.
One problem with these antiviral drugs is the development of mutation resistance, which can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdesivir has a high genetic limit to tolerance.Many clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
There are currently three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 illness. Two of these are placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan announced that it will begin clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an asymptomatic inhaled corticosteroid, as a treatment for patients with the novel coronavirus who have not yet developed symptoms.
200 patients with severe medical conditions from Denmark, Germany and Austria will be included in a Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for efficacy.
The Montreal Heart Institute in Canada is studying the role of colchicine in reducing pulmonary irritation and nausea in people with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, began with 6,000 COVID-19 patients over the age of 40 who had mild symptoms and did not require treatment.
Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers or those without effective contraception are not eligible.
Several anti-malarial agents are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, a light molecular weight drug, is used to treat a wide range of patients.The Italian Medicines Agency helped develop this guideline.
A large-scale clinical trial of 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14 to study the potential of anoxaparin sodium as a preventative and therapeutic agent.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on re-targeting approved antiviral drugs before MERS, SARS and West Nile virus were approved.
Ribavirin: The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines recommends that ribavirin be used as a COVID-19 treatment.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended as a treatment for COVID-19 by the 7th edition of the CHI.
Some antibiotics are considered to be a potential treatment for COVID-19, but are not:
Tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor): has been approved in China.
See also trials in Italy and China for tossilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a psychotropic vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, several trials are underway to develop a vaccine of this size.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, within 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety trials.
COVID-19 was first identified in September 2019.
A pandemic spread across the world in 2020, prompting massive investments and research efforts to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are working to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 using the imprinted genomes.
Announced in April, CEPI's key development milestones for vaccines are speed, manufacturing capacity, mass availability, and global supply.
In April, CEPI AI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 in early 2020.
Major stages of the Phase I safety study include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Grade I development and vaccine selection), Moderna (Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I development and vaccine selection, CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to a report by CEPI Scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates in general are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but using little public data (those that are expected to be available or planned in the future).
Phase I-II trials are primarily safety, immunogenicity testing, randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site trials that determine the accuracy and efficacy of drug doses.
Phase III trials involve large-volume and controlled trials of vaccine efficacy to prevent disease and adverse drug reactions at the desired doses.
Effective progress in 79 vaccine candidates since early April 2020 and 74 in children have not been evaluated (still under investigation)
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine that could activate the immune system by modifying viral proteins with a molecular clamp.

This means that they may benefit more than they prevent.
Australia is seeking additional testing by 4,170 healthcare professionals
Vaccines in development may be considered safe or not effective.
Studies in animal models specific to COVID-19 to test the effectiveness of vaccines, such as ACE2-transgenic strains, other laboratory animals, and non-human pathogens, suggest the importance of maintaining biosafety level 3 measures and a robust safety protocol to reduce international integration.
Intrinsic models of human and animal disease by SARS and MERS vaccines
There is no safe and effective vaccine or treatment for SARS in 2020.
According to papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development of a new vaccine or drug for SARS is a priority for governments and public health authorities.
It was believed that the current SARS research vaccine could be a useful model for developing a vaccine against MERS-CoV at a time when MERS was so prevalent.
As of March 2020, one Class I MERS vaccine has been in clinical trials in humans, and three others are in the process, all of which are viral-vectored, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one DNA-dried (MVA-MERS-S) MERS vaccine.
Social media posts have suggested the theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and that a vaccine existed.
The patents on social media are for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Similar symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, constipation, sore throat, difficulty moving and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is mainly transmitted by people who are close to the infected, usually through small stimuli that are released by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these spots are produced by the respiratory system, they can travel long distances and fall to the ground or other places rather than being absorbed by humans.
People can become infected by touching an infected area with their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on infected surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is highly transmissible in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although transmission can occur in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by true reverse transcriptase polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) sampling from nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for those who are suspected of having the virus and their relatives.
The general public's advice on mask use varies, with some authorities saying it should not be used, others recommending it, and others seeking its benefits.
At this time, there is no clear antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.
Local outbreaks of the disease have been reported across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may develop only flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Sudden symptoms of shortness of breath, persistent heartburn, tremor, difficulty moving, swelling of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is needed.
Unusual, upper respiratory symptoms may include wheezing, a ringing in the throat or sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and constipation were reported in several percent.
One Chinese case initially had only signs of oral heart pressure and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the periodic table.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The transmission pathways of these asymptomatic carriers are not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
A large number of asymptomatic cases are currently being identified and monitored, with the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases are asymptomatic on their hospital admissions.
China's National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases on April 1, and of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic.
The colic and the rash are highly virulent.
A lot more sites are affected by loud speech than normal speech.
A study in Singapore shows that uncovered coughing can cause bedbugs to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Because the virus is not entirely airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission is possible, and air collectors have tested positive for RNA in samples from other people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may involve aerated respiratory fluids, which can cause airway obstruction.
Although there is a risk of transmission, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most commonly transmitted when people are symptomatic; however, transmission can occur before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was unclear where the disease was transmitted, but that it could be two or three people to one person.
Specifically, the virus can survive on the surface of an armadio for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) for three days, and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for four hours, and on 99% copper.
However, this can vary depending on the temperature and humidity.
Soaps and detergents are effective if used properly; soap products weaken and disable the immune system of the virus, and they remove dirt from the skin and other areas.
Other fluids, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, a urine sample was taken two days after you fell asleep in hospital.
Of the six patients, five had the highest viral concentration in the first sample, while the sixth had the highest viral concentration when tested in the second.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan in three cases of severe respiratory illness and pneumonia.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has all the characteristics of a coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which is useful as a defense.
Molds are the most commonly affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters human cells using the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in high concentrations in the type II aliviolar cells of the molds.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the human cell".
Severe heart damage was found in 12% of infected patients and was reported in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and was higher in severely ill patients.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high, which is also the cause of the systemic inflammatory response and immune system dysfunction in this disease, but new myocardial damage with cardiac ACE2 receptors may be the cause.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are associated with cardiac function.
A high incidence of blood clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) have been found in ICU COVID-19 patients with poor recovery rates.Autopsies of COVID-19-related deaths have found diffuse alivolar damage (DAD), and inflammatory tumors containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
SARS-COV-2 has a tropism that expresses ACE2 and respiratory epithelial cells; people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-producing T-cells have been found to interact with inflammatory IL-6-producing monosides in people with severe lung pathology with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been detected in the test tube.
WHO has published several diagnostic protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the true reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on respiratory samples with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a nasal swab may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results are of direct value.
Chinese scientists have isolated the strain of the coronavirus and printed its genetic sequence, and the world's laboratories have successfully tested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to prevent transmission of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and detect whether a person has already been infected) were under development, but not widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown a 60 to 70% accuracy.
The US FDA approved the first test point for use on 21 March 2020. Test guidelines were proposed by Wuhan University Hospital Zhongnan for detection of infectious agents by clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Peripheral, asymmetric and post-transmission, such as bilateral multilobular hernia, are common in early infections.
Subplural enlargement, enlarged cavities (lobelar septal enlargement with alveolar enlargement), and considilation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is limited data on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings of autopsy:
Macroscopy: Pelloritis, pericarditis, and pulmonary and pulmonary condylation
Four types of viral pneumonia can be diagnosed for severity:
Mild pneumonia, pulmonary edema, lymphocytic hyperplasia, atypical lymphocytes, interstitial inflammation including lymphocytic infiltration and multicellular large cells
Severe pneumonia, diffuse alvicular injury (DAD) with dilated alvicular exudate.
DAD is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Treated pneumonia, fluid retention in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood, circulating intravascular coagulation (DIC); lycoerythroblastic response
Precautions to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds after washing, keeping a good breathing mask and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends using a soft mouth guard and a hand sanitizer when you are coughing or sneezing.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings in crowded areas to reduce the potential for transmission from people who do not show symptoms.Social distancing measures have been used to prevent people infected from coming into contact with crowds, including closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and closing public places.
Distance guidelines People should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no effective vaccine against COVID-19 and vaccines are not expected to be available until 2021; the key method of controlling COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands for at least 20 seconds if they cough frequently, especially after going to the toilet or if they have dirt on their hands, before eating or after coughing, coughing or coughing.
The use of a 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer is recommended if there is no consistency in the ingredients, and if soap and water are not available.
In these formulations, these antimicrobial activities are derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
It helps to kill bacterial infections with hydrogen alcohol and peroxide; hand antiseptics are not a potent anti-aging agent.
Glycerol is treated as a humicant.
People are provided with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen support and other large organ support.
The CDC says people suspected of having the virus should wear masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being tested.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Medical assistants are used in the first signs in people with mild symptoms.WHO has issued guidelines to the National Health Commission of China for hospitalized people with COVID-19.
Medical researchers in the US can access the IBCC and provide free information and advice from a variety of sources.
As of April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals prefer paracetamol (acetaminophen) to ibuprofen as the first-line user.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the potential for transmission of the virus, especially in the case of aerosol dispensers in healthcare settings where aerosols can be produced at restricted times, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are advised by the CDC to place the person in an airborne infectious disease isolation unit (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, coughing precautions and respiratory precautions.The CDC has issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during this pandemic.
The contact gear is PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If they are close, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA only authorizes these masks for use in emergency use authorization (EUA).
These are used to protect against airborne agents such as ammonia, but the use of certain biological agents is not guaranteed.
When you do not have a mask, the CDC recommends using a face shield or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other means of transportation, although a small percentage of these cases are.
The need for respiratory support is increasingly evident in people with COVID-19 respiratory failure who are hospitalized, with the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure to eliminate intubation.
It is not yet known whether these two treatments lead to the same benefits in people with severe illness.
A physician may prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if they are nearby because this method reduces aerosol secretion compared to a high-concentration nasal cannula.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds for each patient, which reduces the capacity of the health system to handle the severe cases of COVID-19.
In China alone, 5% of studies have required intensive care, 2.3% required mechanical respiratory assistance, and 1.4% have died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Ventilation mechanics can be complicated as COVID-19 develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes more severe.
Ventilators with pressure control and high PEEP increase oxygen supply and reduce ventilator-related lung injuries and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be present in older ventilators.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir has been shown to be more promising.
Although development of new drugs may continue until 2021, most of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are in advanced stages of testing.
Antiviral therapy may be tested in individuals with severe disease.
The WHO has asked for volunteers to be involved in the trial to verify the efficacy and safety of certain drugs.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convection plasma as an experimental drug, which poses a serious risk to the life of the test subject.
There is no clinical evidence that the disease is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to control the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use surveillance data to 'lock in' and therefore detect potential contamination risks.
One user can view the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is identified, this app will not only advise identification of your friends, but also inform local health authorities.Big data analytics in mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone detection and artificial intelligence are used to identify and identify infected people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people with coronavirus.
This measure is to strengthen quarantine and protect those who have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared its general telephone location data with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Foundation, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify people who have been quarantined by serum.
"Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galera, said that ""40% of people are still moving"" via mobile phone operators".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon that attracted more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid calls for a global innovative solution to the coronavirus.
Individuals may be self-anxious due to quarantine, travel restrictions, and fear of side effects of the infection.
"According to BBC's Rory O'Connor, ""social isolation, privacy, health concerns, stress and economic collapse are all factors that are increasingly affecting people's mental health and well-being""".
The disease may have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, as with other common upper respiratory diseases such as cholera.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with severe or life-threatening illness take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, show that COVID-19 is not yet present.
In these more severe cases, COVID-19 can cause rapid and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
The most severe effects associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, irregular bleeding, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Anemia, especially prothrombin elevation, was reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, and renal dysfunction was reported in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to some reports, the difference between the day of onset of symptoms and the day of death is ten days, with five days of hospital admission.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median death rate from bedwetting to hospital stay.
In early studies, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is 14 days, but can range from six to 41 days.
According to the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men have a mortality rate of 2.8% and women have a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of deceased lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage and fibromycoid exudate in both lungs.
Viral cytotoxic changes are detected in the lymphocytes.
This lung scan appears to be an emergency respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese Health Commission, heart damage was caused by troponin infusion or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of people undergoing sleep treatment had other prior health conditions.
Estimates of the overall mortality rate in this case vary due to regional differences, as well as methodological differences.
Inadequate treatment of mild cases can lead to an exaggerated mortality rate.
However, the deaths seen so far are from patients who have already died, so the current mortality rate is not fully understood
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive monitoring or death than smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Administration found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ failure.
This was followed by a progression leading to post-concussion syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether previous infections can produce active and long-lasting immunity.
The absence of infection is based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in cases of coronavirus that were later followed by positive tests.
These cases are believed to be reinfections of a persistent infection, not reinfections of the infection.
The virus is of intermediate and animal origin and is thought to be transmitted by a tabahilo, a parasite.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, transmission of the virus was almost entirely human-to-human.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, show a date of onset of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
Officials from the WHO reported the onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
There are several methods for calculating mortality rates.
These numbers vary by region and over time are influenced by the number of diagnoses, the complexity of healthcare systems, medical preferences, the proportion of the population since the outbreak, and other characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 sudden death codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for non-laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths for clinically or epidemiologically confirmed COVID-19 deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people who die from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of people who are infected and die from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-limited and are followed by a larger population in the case of a cure.
Since not all infected people develop disease, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have accumulated.
80 (1.7%) of the 4,600 residents of the province, the epicenter of the outbreak, have died in Italy.
In Gangelt, the disease was contracted due to the Carnival Festival, and was able to spread to adolescents, resulting in fewer deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths should be categorized as such.
In addition, the German healthcare system will not be overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, 3% of donors may have antibodies derived from donor blood.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been reported to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of the pandemic are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in a study in China and Italy.
The risk of men in their 50s being diagnosed is only 90 percent different between men and women.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, low prevalence of infectious diseases in women, and higher prevalence of high blood pressure in men may have contributed to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are men and 72% of COVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked data on gender-related COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on January 11, 2020, that the name of the disease was ""COVID-19""".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for coronavirus, VI for virus, and D for disease, with 19 representing the year the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
This name was given to avoid identifying a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, and would have been intended to prevent discrimination if it was not in accordance with international designation guidelines.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus that causes COVID-19"" in public statements".
"The disease and the virus are called ""coronavirus""".
"During the first outbreak of Wuhan, China, the disease and virus were collectively referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov be used as a name for the severe respiratory disease of the virus and the disease causing agent 2019-nCoV, in line with the 2015 guidelines.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
By limiting the capacity of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are producing healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the facility was unable to deliver within the deadline, a local startup engineered the necessary 100 valves in one night.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about its origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other components of the disease have spread rapidly online.
Humans can transmit the virus to animals.
The study found no evidence that the virus could be spreading in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease.
A global study of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry research.
"In March, the World Health Organization began a ""SOLIDARITY Trial"" of four existing antiviral compounds that showed high promise".
However, while vaccines are not required, several agencies are offering vaccine options.
Preliminary work on SARS-CoV has been increasing due to SARS-CoV using ACE2 receptors for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 and human cells.
Three vaccine variants are being studied.
First, studies are trying to develop a full vaccine for the virus.
The use of such viruses, inactivated or killed, is intended to boost the human body's immune system to the novel COVID-19 virus.
A second method, part of the vaccine unit, aims to make the human body immune to the virus's subunit.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine development technique).
The safety and efficacy of these experimental vaccines must be tested within these procedures.The first vaccine was launched by four volunteers in Seattle on March 16, 2020, by European regulators.
This vaccine has a harmless genetic code that mimics the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-assisted enhancement is a recommended feature in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is also controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven trials tested approved drugs for the treatment of malaria, including studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
A re-purposed antiviral drug contains most of the Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries, according to a report released in late April.
The development of COVID-19 vaccines and selected drugs has been extensively reviewed, starting in April 2020. Various antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 detection, including remdesivir, chloroquine for hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
There is limited evidence of remdesivir's efficacy, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements were seen in people who were tested with mild remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, a malaria drug, was studied in China in February 2020 and showed preliminary results.
However, a review of the study is needed.
Health officials in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Institute of Water Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, although taking two of these doses is considered too dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for emergency use by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. This 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary evidence suggests that high levels of ribavirin are necessary for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Vitron.
Nitazoxanide has been tested in a continuous biological trial with low SARS-CoV-2 resistance.Studies of the first spike protein associated with transmembrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is active against ACE2 receptors.
Cloroquine has significant limitations, which is why studies with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine have not been able to be used by the medical community without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no cure for COVID-19.
Cytokine storm is a late environmental side effect of severe COVID-19.
hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tocilizumab was included in its clinical guidelines after a small national study in China.
A nationwide non-random phase 2 trial is underway in Italy after positive results in people with severe illness.
Serum ferritin and blood tests to detect cytokine storms, such developments, are thought to be the cause of death in some people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of multi-causal steroidal refractory cytokine-induced syndromes based on a retrospective case, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, no randomized, controlled trial has shown that tocilizumab is effective for CRS.
Resistant and suppressed antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 are not considered to be effective against people who need to be vaccinated, but have not been tested for the use of the innate immune system.
This method was tested for SARS and yielded unsatisfactory results.
Passive antiviral therapy for viral neutralization is expected to be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as antibody-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be possible.
Other safer antibody therapies, for example, the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convulsive serum administration, which contains a collection of blood fluid from people who have recovered from the disease and contains antibodies to the virus, may be beneficial for rapid efficacy.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, died while trying to raise awareness about COVID-19 before he contracted the virus.
