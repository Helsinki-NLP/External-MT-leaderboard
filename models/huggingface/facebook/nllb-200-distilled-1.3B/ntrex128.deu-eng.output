Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are upset by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly of all political parties fear being the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly said his group was concerned that the name rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh twp stands for doof and pwp for Aa.
A Plaid Cymru National Assembly member said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change but pointed to the strong similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on the name changes, said: The final decision on the designation of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the name Welsh Parliament for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the panel preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while at a public hearing the option MWP received the most support.
The National Assembly members seem to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was scheduled to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with a similar name, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
Today, both are gone.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
People's social lives are different today, he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people meet regularly.
He fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume and that the churches will "sooner or later get back to where they started".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos housing people who do not support the remaining shelters.
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white, he said, and thus hasten the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that held its services nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's congregation was planning to rebuild, they commissioned the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell-ringing "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July used different words: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors drawn in part by lay leaders of the church and part by the bishop's diocese.
The parish council  the governing body of the parish , made up of lay leaders, expressed in July written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the parish council, although the latter had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old California lobster diver
In California, on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters, according to official reports.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel said he thought at first the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
When Hamel arrived at the boy's home, he found that his entire collarbone was torn open.
"I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was concluded that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For 48 hours, officials closed off beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles says there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's is attacking department stores with department stores with specialized assistants, boots, super drugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested at 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, will be expanded to more stores next year.
Investment in cosmetics coincides with supermarkets' search for ways to repurpose store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, its cosmetics range is doubling for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also be given more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its make-up range Boutique, with most products being vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer will test Fragrance Shop in two Sainsbury's outlets, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and a second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily in local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of branches and a number of Habitat outlets, which has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's supermarket stores.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for UK£125 million three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the look of our cosmetics department to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to all needs.Because of the enticing environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that challenge the previous way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal worth £11 million.
Dragons Star Peter Jones is angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two of them's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons star Peter Jones by withdrawing at the very short-term from her lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly "angry" when the "Golden Girl" of television admitted in a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she was no longer able to devote enough time to her new business  worth up to £1.5 million  of the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
A source said that "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority".
It should ensure their long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are spending the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business dealings".

He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for such positive statements about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news anchor:
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on denuclearisation have, however, stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top diplomat, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US imposed sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
We are very successful with North Korea, he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: an end to missile testing, support for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, claiming hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international support, so this is a bit difficult, said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster management authority, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be involved in the relief effort.
In view of the constant earthquakes that Indonesia has to contend with, the country remains unfortunately ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters have been established in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning in Palu despite a warning in place probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's damaged infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
The government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding shortfalls.
Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes and apartments as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge scores a deep free kick against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London with a goal in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team was 0-1 down.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
I was just trying to get into this position and get to the ball.Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time for myself as possible., Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I had contact with the ball, I didn't think too much about it and I just took the shot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward then gave Mateo a heel pass, then turned around near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick double pass in the middle of the field.
Then he threw a steep pass, putting Hazard in the penalty box.
Hazard left the defenders behind and hit a left-handed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker and into the back of the net.
Liverpool play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face each other in the UEFA Europa League video game on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which sent waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that is of great importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was trying to get to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that it will take hours before they can re-enter the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She keeps saying, "This is so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the checkpoint and another vehicle was outside the checkpoint.
Inside the barricade were several police officers guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to log entry 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of a debate over the rewrite of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The storming of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure many still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course from the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely true account is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killer pig bites Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, whose surname was only Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood, near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his nose.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated", the cousin, whose surname was Wu, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was being held to prevent attacks on other people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They like to twitch and are very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
He said they just had to be treated with the right amount of respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on its way across the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, pink will bring flood-inducing rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa had wind speeds of 86 miles per hour, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 400 miles (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is being carried northward in the southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, over the next few days, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching trough to produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, two to three inches [2.5 to 10 cm] of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, floating debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in rainfall rates of nearly two to three inches [5 to 7.5 cm] an hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, particularly much of Arizona, up to two to three inches of rain is expected.
The dispersion of tropical rainfall makes it possible for floods to occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly discouraged to go to the desert on foot.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to burst into torrents, and thunderstorms can bring local gusty winds and winds that bring dust with them.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of over one centimetre is possible, which can lead to small amounts of drifting debris and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first rain showers will arrive in Arizona Sunday night and Monday morning, with heavy rainfall on Monday night and Tuesday.
Tuesday, heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners region and continue through Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the central United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 degrees Celsius.
Over the next few days, the continuing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For much of the central and eastern United States, a warm early October is expected with widespread temperatures of 27°C from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing .
Over 20 million viewers watched on six television networks Thursday the stirring testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued as the networks interrupted their regular programming on Friday over a last-minute twist: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen watched the hearing.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office viewership.
To put this in perspective, this is roughly the same as the number of people watching a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionated anchors strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest total of any network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the all-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters loudly pressured him in the elevator on his way to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there for minutes, his eyes downcast, while he was reprimanded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
"You have power, while so many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office released a statement, adding before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later as the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on whether to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the full Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week as the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was significant because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the nation's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, calling a proposal to impose tariffs on each other by the UK and EU "totally absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on a charge of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson, who police say lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by CBS affiliate WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for their "care and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-3 winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this", Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash on Mexico City.
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grumbling and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles [72 km] southeast of Mexico City, since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between riot police and pro-independence protesters, as thousands took part in other demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing independence referendum.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the riot police, threw eggs at them and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the roads usually crowded with tourists.
The police also used batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while they were met by unionists chanting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the autonomous region remains tense.
The voters had overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes outside polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer saw the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a major, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the pro-police protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
The situation is getting more tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since late last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to denounce the erosion of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Also, there's a possibility that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga scores means Livingston has a 1-0 win over Rangers .
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised Rangers and led to only the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive in allowing Gary Holt's team to tie Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and face Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, can increase his division winning streak to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn't had a losing season since taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing chances against a wild-card guest.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, because his directness was putting the Rangers in a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of goal, then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after slipping in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
Thus the decisive gate was made.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson brought Menga into shooting position, who hit the goal with a contact ball from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession but could not overcome the hosts' defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unmolested.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow squeezed the ball out of another standard situation past Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly made it into Livingston's penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks were denied - one by Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Phenomenal  by Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally good and have again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their game and their team have changed little since they returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he's rocked the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the line throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard for a while, they couldn't meet that standard.
Their last ball was inadequate  they could only penetrate the home team once , and that's kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, hailed by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Cyclist killed in Deptford car crash
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics treated the man, but he died at the scene.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus diversions have been set up, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
Specialised Tornado officers have been brought in to put an end to the rioting involving eight occupants confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer periods behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a convict.
In October last year, emergency officials were called to the prison to respond to a major riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the deserted southwest, bringing with it the risk of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday night and pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "Since 1950 only 10 tropical cyclones have come within 200 miles of Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression!"
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Arizona border as a hurricane.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of precipitation with occasional up to 15 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and occasionally up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flash flooding, the pink-colored rainfall associated with the drought in the region can be a boon.
Although flooding is a major concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part because of the current drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will remain hurricane-force with maximum winds of 86 miles per hour, and will be 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, before moving north at 12 miles per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken.
So Rosa is expected to make landfall in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be heavy in parts of Mexico, creating a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonoran Desert, rainfall totals of two to six inches [7.5 to 15 cm] are expected, with up to eight inches [25 cm] possible, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The main threat associated with Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest Sonoran Desert, and the deserted southwest of the United States, the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these rains, life-threatening floods and mudslides are expected in the desert and in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack, four arrested for attempted murder.
After a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found wounded at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Somerset Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials asked anyone with a cell phone recording of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the "meanness, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democrats' unscrupulous and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered from the Democrats' "meanness, the anger" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charge.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw that day the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told his crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am running, he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as "resisting and blocking".
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, death toll rising
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them washed away when huge waves washed up on the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi following a powerful earthquake and tsunami.
Hundreds of people were gathering at a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the beach at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to it, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it washed away cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the disaster response agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and businesses, curved and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was rocked by more aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay could have made the tsunami bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse, the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting to warn people on the street below him of the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, cutting off communications around Palu and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other essential supplies.
The airport in the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was scheduled for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala reached Palu City safely, where staff are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but Doseba said they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as relief groups began the difficult task of getting relief work under way, some complained that skilled foreign workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
At the moment, it is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, okay, this is a national disaster, we can accept international support.
As the second night since Friday's earthquake and tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel collapse spread under the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
But his messages led to gray question marks instead of blue ticks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport Police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee while refilling an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to add more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, a man ran after the Brink's employee and stole a sack full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the suspects is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name from  to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The being formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He appears in the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, canceled for emotional reasons.
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current occupational name, but it has a religious meaning for West, according to his own statement.
"I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du", West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "the only one", became just "Yeah", simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who West has worked with before, has written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student aid and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various parts of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan: The country aims to become the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much further behind the US.We are looking for the next AI breakthrough., said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player.
Lee praised past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
It is not China that is taking away the academic elite, but the companies, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired a bunch of universities to work on AI in the last few years.
Lee also believes that a change in U.S. immigration policy could be beneficial to U.S. AI efforts.
I think that people with a PhD in AI should be automatically offered green cards, he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia.
DARPA also announced this month that it will invest $2 billion in its AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, nothing has been done on US legislation regarding the creation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it claims Greek territory.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, a boycott campaign that cast doubt on whether turnout would reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, membership in organizations like the EU and NATO is worth the price.
I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will abide by the result to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I am here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage outside the parliament in Skopje and set up chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door, Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO, Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" vote would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote "Yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he threw a left pass to Sterling.
The English striker used his first contact with the ball in the penalty area to throw the ball back to Aguero, who overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero is struggling with foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
It's happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on that move far away on Brighton's side.
He threw a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues forward aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped.
City play in the Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Jokers trying to ruin the game for the Rockies .
With the Nationals out of playoff contention, there was little reason to force another stake.
The ever-powerful joker, however, hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it's relevant to the playoffs for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least a wild card in a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can throw, because we know the atmosphere in the crowd here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I'd face this year.
Why shouldn't I want to participate in this contest?
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokers pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was making his 34th start, was training in the bullpen on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, his usual day of rest.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not running, but I'm running, so I'm running for great candidates everywhere.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the ugliness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not gonna give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as "resistance and blockade".
"And you've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest".
He named the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, causing a roar in the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document get out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you a  that was really bad body language  the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer accepting all opinions.
The Party is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to reprimand me, it came as little surprise.
I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she had spoken out vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in the impeachment case for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians on.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'the meetings should be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the Friday night GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today are not in this tone, and the promised 'friendlier, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously believed I shared similar political views now expected me to make a turnaround and take positions with which I would never have otherwise agreed, whether on national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak out  no matter what I say , a flurry of abuse follows on social media, calling for my disqualification, denouncing the political centre and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And I'm not alone in that experience.
In fact, I know I'm better off than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called on the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer accept all opinions, and with each motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have often been advised over the last two years to cover my head and not express my opinion so clearly.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the Thatcher government's neglect of my classroom in the whole school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor and as a Cabinet minister.
I never made a secret of my political views, not even during the last election.
I would like to say that I am very pleased that the Commission has taken this opportunity to make a statement on the subject.
To the supporters of Friday's motion, I would just like to say this: given that the country is racing towards a Brexit that will hurt budgets, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I am not sending this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of election or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: undefeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have skewed the final result a bit, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win in this most entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only undefeated team in the table.
In the end, the home team's success was due to their superior defense as well as their better use of chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Acknowledgement for Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, which was raised by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however Melrose was able to make the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released by the Warriors for the game, and Jason Baggot caught an unraised try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a goal directly at half-time and then scoring a solo heightened try, leaving Ayr 17-5 at half-time.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's shot, boosted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field, Ayr extended his lead with a Climo-enhanced try from Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, who was Ayr's captain, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, Melrose had the extra man paid for by an unenhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty area behind the advancing Ayr pack.
Climo raised the bar almost as he had since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to make the switch to the hospitality industry after it emerged he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes the scripts for and in which he plays one of the main roles alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source with the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was interested in joining Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol outside the rope-lined naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag flies at public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is our rightful property".
To take it back is a duty.
Throughout Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may be as high as they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, due on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness and is naturally looking forward to the outcome with a positive attitude, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will be watching the ruling on big screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim, which, after decades of sporadic talks, commits Chile to negotiating sovereign access to the sea.
The stakes are also high for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious re-election bid next year.
We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and believe that this would change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorised to address Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ruling of the ICC is six months after the final appeal suggests that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also be a setback.
The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume their talks, but after these events, it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia had 'an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile' and 'an opportunity to end 139 years of disputes for the mutual benefit of all', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, he added.
The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to get over the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into practice the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees "a delusion".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections of giant headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headgear on the catwalk for their 2019 summer collection, which captured the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their sensational creations across the runway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like broad brim that almost squeezed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a scuba gear, including snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice pack.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on from La Bomba, the two-inch-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears.
The iconic label behind the extremely impractical hat, which made huge waves on social media, sent another great creation over the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a bathing suit holding the bag.
The red orange brassiere bag with brassiere fringes and a white leather heel was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be on the streets next summer. The designer has created so much buzz that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Scotland's independent schools continue to excel academically, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding test scores, and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest possible standard of care for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after as electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you've got their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's examinations show that the languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages obtained A marks in their higher education exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A's in the senior exams, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A's.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as electives, as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for problems filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future jobs.
As more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future from such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilinguals an edge over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
That's why it's important for today's children that we invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from with appropriately specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego .
For fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet certain.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after practice about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare at this stage of my career", he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies planned for next week, including in well-liked places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his confirmation of the Supreme Court vacancy still pending, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time).
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on sexual misconduct allegations, which have been held in a tense atmosphere this week.
But the main purpose of this rally series is to support Republicans facing a difficult November election.
So President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will "mobilising volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House".
"Controlling Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy election season approaches", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight, and media outlets in Pittsburgh will cover it.
Saturday's visit is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to back the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to come in to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness to fight to keep the hope alive for singles on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday afternoon's four-game series may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
They were six points ahead, and now it's four, so I think that means a little momentum for us, Jordan Spieth said as he left the field.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four points, followed by twelve.
However, Spieth said the Americans are feeling a bit of wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can boast three points from four each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and is leading by example.
The guttural shouts of enthusiasm grew louder as his round continued as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had trailed by two points after two holes.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to get down on my knees and take care of my own game", Spieth said.
That's all the individual players have left.
18 holes to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, making Ryder Cup history.
Europe's unequal but likeable duo is four points clear of four and can do no wrong.
The Mollywoods weren't the only couple to miss a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeyes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the energy that seems to flow between them and the cheerful crowd proves that they are the players to beat on Sunday.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But it would be premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-time hero, who starred alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a bind they could hardly overcome.
But on Sunday, no one can help them out of their predicament.
The fours and fours are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a flash.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly ahead on the final day, but this four-round series has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leads the United States 10-6 after Saturday's quarter-finals and quarter-finals and is well into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and managed to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, looking to win back the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the fours in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series 3-1.
In the four-match series, the USA put up more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 singles games Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized brilliantly, beating the disenchanted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged through two games on Saturday, had an occasional flash of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and quarters and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fours, returned and played as Henrik Stenson's partner in the fours, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world number one and number three.
But on that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe was not doing as it had hoped.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinals 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the singles, but as the defending champion, a draw is enough for Fury's team to retain the trophy.
After only being second for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without full confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen its distrust of the United States and that under no circumstances would the country unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "substantial goodwill" measures in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
We do not see any response from the US, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm first.
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization approach, where North Korea would be rewarded for taking successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also resisted calls for an easing of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even against declaring the end of the war, Ri said.
The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a figment of the imagination of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If South Korea, instead of the US, had been the other party to the denuclearisation issue, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this standstill.
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was vastly different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missiles were inevitably going to hit the US mainland after "evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: Whether it takes two years, three years or five months  doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must in any case be vigorously continued until we achieve complete, final and verified denuclearisation.
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to finance Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class to learn how to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University is making sure all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure against the growing macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and studying all night.
One scientist found that students at the world's top university are often lax in their self-esteem.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And then one girl came up to me and said, "Why don't I just learn about this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explained to students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to launch the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see a picture of a dorm room and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books, which provide information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cancer.
Then, a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols is used to encourage them to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how your decision to smoke affects your health", added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of "pushing a night shift" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
To ensure adequate sleep, he said, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and to prevent weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leaving them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should set an alarm clock for bedtime and wake time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston versus Rangers 1-0 Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's goal for Steven Gerrard's disagreeable team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking to record their first away win since a 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side conceded Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the Hearts who are by far the leaders in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the lackluster Rangers seemed to have no chance of equalizing.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
The Rangers are also in for more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury sustained from an apparent object thrown from the passenger block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the squad, which overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, has remained with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point off the Hearts last week and should be thrilled to see his well-trained team keep their opponent under pressure at every turn.
The Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston was more effective when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first goal led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass the rear post.
The Rangers were in control, but their game in the final third seemed more hopeful than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that he should have received a penalty kick after a 15-minute clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers have just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may not have been the game's match, there's no denying that they earned it for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a long shot from Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted at halftime and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, the change having almost immediate effect as the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly racing from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they were meant to, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball one after the other.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final period, but McGregor held up well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called a late penalty kick after a mix-up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado starring the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
I hear a crack!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and "kill" degenerate cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize diseased cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be injected back.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory to see the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar technique, in which immune cells are taken from patients and trained to attack cancer cells, has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance on SNL, wearing a MAGA cap (Make America Great Again).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he flatly praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town", wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he proceeded to lash out at the Democrats, reiterating his support for Trump.
I get asked so often by white people, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist".
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual harassment allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's scolding ride was not aired, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by publishing it.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble backstage with his head covering.
They were harassing me backstage.
You said, "Don't go out with the hat on".
You were harassing me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he's going to put on my Supermancap because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His remarks prompted at least two roars from the audience, and SNL staffers seemed embarrassed, Variety reported.
West had been hired as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture titled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU for DESTROYING THE MASS".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just being himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I would NOT like to reward (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) someone who adopts and gives of himself to an ideology that I think is harmful to my community.
He's free.
The same applies to us., she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to The being formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg went by the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in connection with a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in the Arbitration Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution is investigating the allegations.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as sword wielding Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often make boys feel they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also of 31 years, also of Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important" to him.
I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment, he said.
What have we taught the growing men about the problem we are now seeing?
Harington believes that television, due to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television and on the street that makes a boy feel that he must embody that particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Because something clearly went wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be participating in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ended next summer.
Starting in November, Harington will be seen in a re-release of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about Game of Thrones for him was meeting his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I have my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the lover of Harrington's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte.

HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year on year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is widely reported.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffers leaked the data of GOP senators, criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the House Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said she believed the claims of "ultra-right" experts and websites would be spread.
"Lies, lies and more heinous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released is said to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, released during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by an unidentified person in the government district.
The release came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie, Waters continued.
The member of my staff  whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations  was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
People who are accused of something they didn't do shouldn't be angry.
You can't be defiant.
You cannot question the prosecution's motives.
You must be calm and composed.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big deal if this is true", he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.
"You only live three times" "A weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson"
It's now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-colored film, and it seems to be the case with this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English, The Spy Who Shagged Her, and stutteredly revived in 2011 with Johnny English, Just Now.
Is an ironic self-parody on how obviously stupid we are turning into a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glint-eyed, grimacing and incompetent Johnny English to screw up has been renewed for a second time, and his name signals more than anything else that he is a common comic creation for moviegoers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he's the crazed secret agent who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, when in reality he's made up of some clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a click of this guy who contributed a single note to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics for the theme song to "The Hour of the Winner".
Also, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's latest adventure has a nice moment or two.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor, the blades of the rotor briefly hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather weak and oddly redundant, especially as the "serious" film series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now also offer confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures aren't as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gag as the Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents on duty, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty, an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a bloated and distressed figure already on the verge of total collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been exposed and she must therefore bring someone from retirement.
This includes the goofy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy establishment but is teaching undercover work off the record, with a few gags, because English offers a School of Rock-like spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his formerly-heavily tested sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a pesky woman of high society whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's intelligence service, are back in action, where they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they cause chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English tries to get inside Volta's house using a virtual reality headset, causing sheer anarchy.
This last sequence is a complete setback, but as fun and enjoyable as it is, it is a subject that is covered extensively on children's television.
It's a fairly moderate amount of stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really lived up to his talent?
Labour denies working on a plan to make Britain work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
This would give the employees a three-day weekend, but still give them the same pay.
Sources say the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of workers.
The changeover to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
A change will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an endeavour which is in line with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the Party's overall industrial policy strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit-makers" in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make  deductions due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees to company boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity capital of private companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that might ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about it than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I told the court that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, that claim was made, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be set in stone.
"My opinion is firm on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be a bombshell", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all those who mentioned her could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has this festival helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission  to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is in its seventh year, not only to see performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in poverty alleviation.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you must complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communicating with a leading world politician (by email or phone) or similar activities to raise awareness of the goal  the fight against poverty .
How successful is the project, given that Global Citizen has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of promising a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it's time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism  when you think you can make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that the project has seen more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least US$10 billion has already been disbursed or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition Project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, which pledged $35 million to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, which is what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They said, "It's going to be a long, hard road with ups and downs.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosting.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports  Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examiner, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to prevent energy from Russia from reaching markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
I think the real reason for Russia's involvement in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe, he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways to do that.
The United States can work with the Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and block them if necessary to prevent energy from Russia from reaching the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the event attendees of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that sees itself as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia, he said, while describing Russia as a One Trick Pony with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made as the Trump administration was in the process of expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as the far less expensive option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth US$11 billion and designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we all agree that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure and that consumers can choose their own suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received a headwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply, says BDI's board member Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "test" a 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced Saturday that she would "closely consider" a presidential bid after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to consider a presidential bid after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about the way Donald Trump is treating our democracy", she said.
Warren has not taken a page off her lips in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation was of course required before the vote.
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's constituency does not believe she should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic candidates who are considered for a 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make his official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally on post-traumatic stress disorder, which Palin suffers from.
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room", and said of her son and other war veterans that they come back changed, that they come back more grounded, that they come back and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal challenge to new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a forensic briefing in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who questions the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not released.
She reported that her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are seeking asylum in the United States, as nations that are struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels".
The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle, the expert's statement stated.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that policies that deny immigrants entry into the country adversely affect the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary manpower.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is available to anyone who leaves their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
It was never intended that by granting asylum we would alleviate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as race fatalities double over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she calms her feverish young son at a rescue centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, a new ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their wet belongings and salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospital workers, who were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
It all happened way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls", he told The Associated Press, adding that the reason for his stay in the city was a wedding.
I heard my wife's cries for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place.
US Ambassador accuses China of tyranny with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital of Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, last Wednesday after he accused China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election are consistent with the statement US officials made to Reuters; a new phase in an escalating campaign launched by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a widespread trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, which exports large amounts of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling down on this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
With its propaganda spread, the Chinese government is claiming America's proven tradition of free speech and independent press by running paid ads in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing voices at the newsstands here in Beijing and not a real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic development given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had not accepted the offer to publish his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are scolding voters ahead of midterm elections with the debacle over Kavanaugh, observers warn
With many of the most influential Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, which could come from women in particular.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already announced that they will proceed with a vote.
"These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow, and they don't forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, first counselor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to stick with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer, told the news site.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, observers suggested that a backlash could ensue if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
It's not just about the panel vote, the final vote or Kavanaugh's review; it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated them, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the Democratic election, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided on who to believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a somewhat larger share siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced by Ford's statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was attacked by Kavanaugh when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee had exposed his genitals to her at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made the point that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
We must act now, he said on the topic of start-ups.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide for himself who can access which data.
The company calls this concept personal empowerment and development through data.
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and related capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a major change that would completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
We're not asking for her permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-state Web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee helped to redesign the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key player in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely confident about this new era of the web, he added.
Father Bernard Vann, recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I was honored 100 years later in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his actions in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain's highest war honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was symbolic because the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic deed.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through thick fog and under heavy field and machine gun fire.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with "great bravery" before advancing alone with a field gun and eliminating three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that made you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a true hero is shown above all by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a thrilling Bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose Bill featured 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night long in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the UK audience was not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly on display.
Some were untouched after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the fight.
A fan described the switch to the cartoon character on Twitter as a kind of bad joke.
Due to a government policy, this content is classified as not suitable for young people, so it had to be changed to a children's show at 6am, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa, the pig, that's right.
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said that the company would update the schedule to take into account UK viewers in the future.
I think the problem could be solved in the replay, he said.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning for viewers in the U.K., and we won't solve the incident until Sunday, Monday local time.
But we're sticking with it.
There was a lot of communication when we moved, and it was a mess, and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical malfunction.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the government's part.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to narrow it down to five fights instead of six as usual, and we've tried to provide the fans with the best possible experience.
The whole situation is rather unfortunate.
Tom Daley feels inferior when it comes to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has competed in several Olympic Games as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize he was different until high school.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, winning the Olympics is not so important to him.
The original host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, is taking a break for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, he said that he used to consider himself inferior to others because love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said, "To this day, feeling inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately my success".
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke out on the subject because he was fortunate to live without restrictions and discrimination and wanted to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner 20 years older last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been an issue.
He says that when you have to go through so much as a child and teenager - he competed in the Olympics for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it is hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple had a son in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes his whole outlook has changed since then.
Last year, he would have won gold medals.
But there's more to him now than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main asset.
He shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept his impending death, and one of the last things he asked for were tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he is not invincible", he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics", he said.
His first song selection, Proud by Heather Small, was also influenced by this, which he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still made him goose bumps.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, sits on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he's got to work hard to keep it from turning into a debacle.
Mickelson, playing in the event for the 12th time, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he usually is, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering for others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that plagued him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal fit for the cramped Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the course itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson will face perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a rookie in those tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in their 12 singles games and can get off to a hot start, Mickelson's play could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was fully aware of his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the world's most famous personalities and he's done so much in the past and this week for these teams.
I didn't think he'd be in two games.
I had more in mind, but that's how it turned out and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldos' record for most Ryder Cup games played on a Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence alone has enriched the team.
He is funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team, he explained.
I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that the lead may be over soon.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the final singles of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning by 141⁄2131⁄2 points.
"The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that was close", said Bjørn (pictured), after watching the Class of 2018 win 53 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience has shown me and all the team members that it's not over.
We're going to start tomorrow.
You just get in there and do the right thing.
This is not over until the dots are on the bulletin board.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what we're up against on the other side: the best players in the world.
Happy about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn said: "I would never rush this.
Tomorrow, it's going to be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual achievements, and that's a whole different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to the limit of your golfing skills.
You have to make it clear to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he needs to get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turning points on the final day of the tournament, he was on the winning side in Brooklyn before he was on the losing side after Europe's "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to a fast start like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We'll set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel like it, you know, we'll try magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with counterattacking, he must face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything", says Bjorn about his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, it will not be delivered until next year, according to local media.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Times, which cited a military spokesman.
The ship was to have been commissioned as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are to include a high-powered cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-sea missiles, and stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible for the newest frigates not to have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
The continuing delays, however, may mean that the state-of-the-art warships that are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate that was the target of the disaster made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship back and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the yard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are manned by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also noted that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz was apparently twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training the crew, became a problem.
The cost appears to have risen to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the €2.2 billion originally envisaged.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German parliament's military commissioner, confirmed that the navy was running out of ships.
Bartels said that the problem had grown over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could be taken out of the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out at a farm in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as brown long-eared and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations on the property to record the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with portable detectors.
An expert analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species is doing what.
A map and habitat report are then drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help to identify the benefits of habitat management measures such as grassland and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat stocks in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their night-hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-tracking to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the bat issue very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct examinations, inspections of sleeping areas and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
Here in Threave, we have a great bat area, he explains.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats yet, so we're doing this work here and on other properties that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel good.
He stressed the importance of pre-maintenance prevention of bats in the holdings, as the unintentional destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help.
She explains: 'We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we don't know what the population situation is.
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape allegations against him "fake news" and said people "want to be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus Torino striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports Fake News just hours after they were published.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to do this.
What they reported today: Fake News, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They're trying to profile themselves by using my name.
It's not a bad thing.
You want to be famous for my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror over allegations they described as "illegal reporting on privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player was seeking compensation for moral damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is believed to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was 99 percent a good guy who succumbed to one percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later settled out of court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and "afraid of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to rescind the agreement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK would regret losing carmakers forever
The UK would 'forever regret' losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Economy Secretary Greg Clark said.
He went on to say that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if the UK left the EU.
Clark says we need a deal.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis lines are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that if Brexit is uncontrolled at the end of March, we will experience production stoppages at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard no-deal exit and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to carmakers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's production facility operates on a Just-in-Time basis, meaning that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to produce the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock of more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company explained, and therefore production had to be stopped.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is exactly designed to avoid such border controls.
We need a deal.We want the best deal, which, as I said, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but also to seize this opportunity, he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The lessons learned not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains we have so far.
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be halted, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed at Burnaston for 24 years and is the top official in the Unite union at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had raised the possibility of secret recordings of his conversations with Trump and the removal of the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday as new reports emerged about his supposed resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it clashing with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not yet been set. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court right now.
But I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "influence-hatred" of TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't deny that they are influence-haters".
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President does more Q&A rounds than any President before him, she said, without providing any specific evidence:We have looked at these figures
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but only if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why when he gave a bizarre and sometimes bizarre speech to a gathering of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU NHS workers over Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health is addressing people from outside the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wishes for them to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of residence permit applications for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU have continued to negotiate their withdrawal over the summer and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for all of you.
I therefore wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the side line before he was put on a stretcher and transported away for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the nature or extent of the injury are known" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he had recorded a total of five tackles, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty on purchases of UK property in future, with the additional revenue to benefit the homeless under new Conservative Party plans.
This move is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the extra income to benefit the homeless.
This move is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty and includes the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties available for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to add up to £120 million a year in revenue.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors outside the United Kingdom, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, particularly the capital, have become 'ghost towns' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to give more young people their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land without using it and urged Theresa May to drop quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "housing disgrace".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a sensational series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rent fix to a ban on evictions without good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of bettering life from generation to generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-UK residents and companies based abroad to buy property as it is for hardworking British citizens.
The dream of a home has become too remote for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains too great a problem.
Jack Ross: My biggest goal is to manage Scotland
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says that his "greatest goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the north-east English club, which is currently third in League One and three points clear of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bench and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
But I used to watch Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and that's something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I was successful in managing the club.
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claimed he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by whether I can get the club back into the Premier League.
He said that given the structure and the opportunities in this club, he definitely belongs in the Premier League.
It is no easy task to get him there, but I would only consider my time here a success if I could get the club back there.
Ross has a three-year management career, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to League Three and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was a real crossroads, he recalls, when he took over responsibility for Alloa.
I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I didn't do badly, I made a good living off of it, and I had some very pleasant highs.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I still do it because of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and I'm doing it now, and I've never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sport Sound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time to have a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study.
The summer heat wave has missed a boost in revenue for Britain's failing pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar businesses saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pubs saw sales rise by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants suffered even more.
The 1.8% decline in the restaurant sector in June continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks fared best, with area-adjusted sales growth rising higher than declining for restaurants.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and restaurant industry analysts RSM, explained: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in the turnover in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent loss in sales compared to the previous year, in addition to continued cost pressures, will be particularly painful.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused business operators and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite.
The overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over £9 billion and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in so-called Fake Insta pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have social media accounts that they can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in so-called fake Insta accounts, a nod to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who was urging others to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of athletes' at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of Scottish Athletics at its Annual General Meeting as a non-executive member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
Eilidh is respected in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from her election to the Council, said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope to make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic gold medals and is a frequent BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a temporary blood disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'll recover.
It was hard work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and am doing some mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows causes a stir on the Internet
A manufacturer of milk pumps caused a stir on the Internet with a commercial comparing breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what it claims is the world's first portable, low-noise milk pump, consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released a somewhat lighthearted music video to highlight the freedom the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a dick in me" or "In case you haven't noticed, those aren't eats, those are my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has met with mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it belittles the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, except that their young are taken away within days of birth", one commenter said.
Elvie's milk pump fits neatly into a breast-feeding bra.
Another comment read: Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use it to advertise a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another person added:  Such a far-fetched advertisement.
Others defended the advert and one woman admitted that she found the song "ur comical".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping it out, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to over-interpret it.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one person.
Another person commented: This is a funny ad directed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals to the women that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a breast bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go outside during the pump procedure.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, explained: Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that come with them, while also presenting the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a fun and understandable way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is at an all-time high, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because of the Trump administration's harsher rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to place children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and now fear being targeted for deportation if they report to take a child in.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective caregivers and other adult members of their household would be required to hand over their fingerprints and share that data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Almost 80 per cent of people who are either carers themselves or members of a carer's household are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreign criminals.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals', Albence said.
To speed up the processing of the children's cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to shelter staff, require some children to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear by video link rather than in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
If the decision is negative, the person will be deported quickly.
The longer these children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted outbursts, according to information from shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in the last month.
Advocates say these concerns are reinforced in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child's problems are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They also said that the trauma many of the children already suffered could be exacerbated if they were moved to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and were being treated accordingly.
You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territory is cleared" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are aligned against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were in place and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prevent refugees from returning home.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return, he explained.
They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be provided to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity to push forward political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian armed forces on the province, which has a population of three million.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would be "eliminated".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and stated that its work should be limited to revising the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a impeachment or scandal did not prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency in history.
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting tired.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at peak times, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show topped ratings with 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything you see on television, can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen to realize that you've already spent six hours watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of so-called "Deep Background" sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket, or the impact of Stormy Daniel's riotous description of Trump's, well, anatomy.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Some of what he does feels like a reality show he shows you every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three from the pawn shop", about Trump's rotating cast and daily plot twists (breaking down a fence with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're not coming.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his house on the north shore of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he was crawling inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He just couldn't get away from the screen, not when Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Donations flow to the tightest congressional race in the midterm elections.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is awash in donations thanks to redrawn district boundaries that have left two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb district is running for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District triggered a campaign finance battle between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a highly-anticipated special election in March for the state's 18th congressional district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won it by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much opposition from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
US State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all US missions abroad from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, was considered for punitive measures.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar gathering the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which diplomats say will take place in mid-October, to signal the importance the government attaches to the gathering.
The three American diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh announcements or punitive measures from Washington.
A spokesman for John Bolton's administration declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Her comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning From the Past
The next big surprise could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now ample evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is now reportedly also investigating whether Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Trump would face a body that will hold him accountable, just as he is about to run again for office, and possibly for a jury.
That is a lot of "ifs" and I do not want to say that the fall of Donald Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if the West would only resist and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who will decide the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the report from the New York Times.
How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we're in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about the game against Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to make an appearance until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing we could make something of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated the first half, but we tried hard in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do it with the crowd behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can look ahead, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Fear of retirement causes women to have sleepless nights.
Although the survey respondents knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the women in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes in time.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial adviser on board: your adviser can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Their financial choices for long-term care can include traditional nursing insurance, a hybrid capital-generating life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a power of attorney so that you have a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It's not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors? asked Martin.
What is the medication treatment?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Have you already made that plan?
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was walking home from work with friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as a "voluntary act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
Due to the failure of communication systems, aid workers were unable to receive information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that stretches along a coastal strip of over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The government district, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The fishing and agriculture sectors are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, affecting 14 countries and killing 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hits the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was caused, but over 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hit the popular tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and stranded thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin 's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former vice presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting police, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from an acquaintance as she tried to call the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been posted.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where when asked about his plea, he replied, "Not guilty, sure", the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the wave hitting the country are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for suspects in the New York terrorist attack .
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot pickup truck to carry out a terrorist attack in October, when he ran over pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the plea in the death penalty suit filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the context of organized crime, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "profound planning and intent", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as "abominable, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain, grief and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a case that sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal crime was executed in New York City was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, court documents say.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to do the deed after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also demanded to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all involved, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP calls for Brexit negotiations to be postponed
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP party leader said politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would "already be out" if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided party was compounded by the fact that members of your party who are in favour of remaining in the EU took part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister is having trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that Chequers belong on the garbage.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was responsible, we'd be out already, he explained.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will be in favour of Brexit, but Chequers belongs in the trash.'
He emphasized his opposition to the EU by saying: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely false.
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please drop your chequers and start listening.
In a sharp message to May, she continued: Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep your promises.
Farage said in a speech that politicians "must feel the pressure" if they are to cheat the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class, Farage said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and that's why we're here today to tell them, you're not getting away with this.
He told an enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We are mobilising the power of the people of this country, who helped us win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of anti-Brexit activists within May's party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party peer, made fun of the Tories for having security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders, are there in Ireland, says Adonis.
This is a farce.
He added that there was simply no good Brexit.
Warren plans to take a closer look at the presidential bid.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has declared that she will "carefully consider the presidential candidacy" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voters in what's known as the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.
Arrested after shooting LSU player Sims to death
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they have arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of the injury, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to sports media outlet 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world championship after his team gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed ahead of Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' stall order would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he was ahead of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went into the pits first and pushed Hamilton into the traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close wheel-on-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, at the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from one of the back seats of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first lap.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri was a great performer all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he asked me to pass.
The team did an excellent job to win a double, says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event on Saturday for insisting she had not released to the press the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was not addressed directly, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "mean, malicious and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that's happened in the Senate over the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and dishonest", the president said.
When you look at the leaks and you say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, one moment, please.
Did we -- no, we didn't publish it, he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein was leaked the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, although Feinstein denies the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish your story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I agreed to her request for secrecy.
Her denial did not seem to go down well with the president, who said at the campaign event on Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continuing defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the naughtiness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt when they put themselves under the wheels to maintain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee .
The Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday with a 5-3 win in the replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead early on the clock, on the back of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equalization before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for Adam Keefe's men, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League this season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes on a pitch from Kendall McFaull.
In this exciting opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his equalization goal after 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before halftime when he scored his second goal of the night just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalised with a power-play goal in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen then secured his team's victory with a fifth goal after just over half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Pilot died after making sure hundreds of people on a plane escaped the earthquake
An Indonesian pilot is being hailed as a hero after he died trying to get a plane with hundreds of people on board to take off safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was hit by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still being felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swaying control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to fall.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia's aviation safety agency, said that decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
He added that the Commission was deeply concerned by this news.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, with the country's disaster management agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached, said authority spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute a new ambulance arrives with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's military: I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks that go with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing over 550 people.
Air Niugini reports one missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very flat.
"This is a very good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a pier rushed to the rescue in an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sank into about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
The Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people were killed in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its testimony Saturday in a retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of their deaths.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sandford said he lied about my pickup being in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost their messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers died.
He erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge will assume that the case will then be heard by the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop socially conscious again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues couple for firing after racist texting
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "still black".
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to "blackmail".
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new daycare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"Never again, never again", Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her fake passport, the "embarrassed" plastic surgeon fired Maurice, claiming that the outgoing African-American daycare worker had done a poor job and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and is claiming compensation for the $350 a day she would have spent over six months on the job she was originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", she told the newspaper on Friday.
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, arguing that firing Maurice was the reasonable step, as they feared that Maurice would no longer be trusted after he insulted them.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", explained husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone who was rude to them, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now.
Plasco compared the legal dispute to "blackmail" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
You want to prosecute a person like that?
This is not very nice, the investment banker added.
As the legal battle continued, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today is very funny with our current knowledge of Paddington's huge success.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a small teddy bear, would have had no problem with his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, who she describes as "a very important member of the family".
He was a very quiet man and didn't brag, Jankel said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for its success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone .
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance, says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, telling me that she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping was slowly wearing off and leaving her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything came down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head down and tears were running down my cheeks the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hang signs to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide struggle to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day, she explained.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up a room.
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after he committed suicide.
Davis explained: 'I'm always afraid that this could have an effect.'
Davis designed the maps to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, we need to talk about this.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He did not say that he felt depressed or down, she explained.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at his lowest point, and when the kids were unwrapping their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said his death was a big trauma for her, but that she had to get through it: "It's a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh 's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation .
"I thought if we could actually get what he asked for, a limited investigation in time and scope, then maybe we could get some agreement", Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dislike is due solely to the timing.
With the November 6 midterm elections only five weeks away, if the Republicans do poorly as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their bid to elect their husband to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can muster at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide in a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors sinks under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean politician said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1,127 defectors were registered last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks on the suspended denuclearisation talks.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
If we cannot trust the US, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm first unilaterally, said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court job.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was characteristically unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but feel that a woman who would have acted like that would have been labeled 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he would almost scream and almost burst into tears when he spoke about his family and high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational murder" organized by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't serve on the Supreme Court because it shows he's biased against Democrats.
"I think he's declared himself unfit by these statements and the way he's been talking about the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he were confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'm going to say this much: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but unfit for his current position as a judge", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion policy decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person coming to this courtroom and expecting us to say, 'Oh, isn't that wonderful?'
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of boiling anger and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's uncommon, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she cries when she gets angry, but she's developed a technique, and if she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger, in part because they're completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying out of indescribable rage and was grabbed by the collar and dragged up the stairs by an older woman, a cold-hearted manager who I had always been a little afraid of.
"Don't let her ever see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're pissed.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with themselves because they think you've gone off the substance.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called the Monkey Business having an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign already well underway, she was behind on fundraising and vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men only gave $250 to her campaign.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude to her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, and anger over sexism, that she was close to tears.
"You could have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
You would have thought that Kleenex, the handkerchief manufacturer, was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
She was crying?
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening ointments of the US-China trade war were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a gulf between the countries in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new punitive tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has responded in the same way each time, recently imposing punitive tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to any action taken by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will stumble anytime soon.
To induce Washington to bow would mean to yield, but a public bow to the United States would be far too shameful for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers previously realized", says Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring normalcy back.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for much of the tournament, sank his shot at the 16th hole (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution, said Garcia, who was emotional after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2-1 in singles against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, who I've watched on TV since I was a kid", said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed at a high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought hard.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make any of it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off.
We have been defeated.
Red tide update: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more gaping flowering conditions are being recorded in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
A red algae bloom stretches along about 130 miles of coastline from north Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in or off the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory distress continues to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No new respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
