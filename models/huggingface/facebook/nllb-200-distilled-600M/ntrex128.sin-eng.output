The AMs in Wales were concerned about 'looking like idiots'
Some AMs were alarmed by a proposal to change their position to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It was brought about by the plans to rename the Welsh parliamentary session.
The AMs through the political audience were concerned that it could be called a joke.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned about the "suspension with its Twp and Pwp".
For the Welsh-speaking audience: Twp in Welsh means "crazy" and pwp means "uncomfortable".
A member of AM in a wool suit said the group as a whole was "displeased" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh-neutral activist said their group was "open minded" about changing the name, but that it identified us as a short verbal leap from the MWP to make us stupid.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire English accent.
The current Assembly Commission, which drafted legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision of any commentator who calls the Assembly members is in fact a matter for the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorised members to change their name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals that found wide support for calling the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the position of AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP alternative received the most support in obtaining public advice.
The AMs seem to be proposing alternatives, but the effort to get the prototype to the official, Ellen Jones, who hopes to introduce a bill of amendments in a few weeks, may be a headache.
The reform legislation will include rules on the inadequacy of AMs and other changes to the way the meeting works, including the establishment of the committee system.
AMs will vote on the final question of how to address them when they debate legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Saw, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
When the churches of Harlem struggle, the crowds of St. Martin's are silent.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said that there was a nursery and a church at every end", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of that".
He said that the invisible is perceived.
"People are social in many ways these days", he said.
"The classrooms are no longer the basement living rooms where people regularly go".
As for churches, he regrets that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and "sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-storey apartment complexes with buildings filled with people who do not support the remaining churches on the ground floor.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartment complexes in these buildings will be white", he said, "so the day when all these churches will be together will be imminent, as people who have moved into these apartment complexes cannot be expected to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the White Clergy before Harlem became a black priest - the capital community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The Methodist Church, a white denomination, left in 1930.
The black church, which was placing blankets around it, took possession of the building.
The Black Church, led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, led a strike on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that prevented black people from hiring or being promoted, seized ownership of St. Martin.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's contributors prepared plans to rebuild it, and they put the Gunta Wildlife in operation.
The priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the giant wolf "the giant wolf of the poor".
One expert who played the gana wild in July called it something different: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany A.G., an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first organ played by Dionysius A. Lind, a black musician who had moved to the largest organ in the Church of the River Eight 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not taken his place.
The roles of St. Martin's have over the past few months been a complex myth of architects and contractors, some introduced by church amateur leaders, others by the bishops' monarchy.
A vestry composed of amateur leaders - the governing body of contributors - wrote to the bishop in July, noting that the bishop was concerned about "expenditure on vestry", although the bishop was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the vestry.
Some contributors complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the Guru.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy who was diving to catch poultry in the California wild
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during the early days of the California poultry season while diving.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamal told KSWB-TV in Santiago that he heard a boy crying for help while diving for an hour and a half with his friends on Saturday morning, and then ran into the water with a group of people and pulled him out.
He said that he thought it was just the excitement of catching a chicken, but then realized that he was crying out, 'Hit me!'
I was bitten!
When he reached the boy, Hamal said his entire ankle was torn open and his ankle was broken.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in Santiago, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Life Saving Larry Gillis said in a press conference a few weeks ago that a shark had been caught in a net, but it was determined that it was not a threatened species of shark.
Gills added that the area of the upper elevation of the accidental tank was hit by a fall.
For investigative and security purposes, officers are closing access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Master Beach in Escinitas for 48 hours.
Although there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of them are not considered threatened.
Sansbury's plans will push the UK beauty market forward.
The Sainsbury supermarket chain will take over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, including a retail-style retail chain with specialist assistants.
As part of a significant £2.8 boost to the growing beauty market, which continues to decline in fashion and furniture sales, 11 major beauty stores across the country will be tested, including 11 major beauty stores, and if successful, will open more next year.
The charging of cosmetics once came as a trace of supermarkets for the use of TVs, microwave ovens and flatbed space for furniture.
Sainsbury said for the first time its cosmetics offering will be doubled to 3,000 products including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, Dr. PawPaw and more.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range of products to those found in shops like Boots will have more space with brand fields similar to the existing range.
The supermarket is also reopening its shopping line to make the product more vegetarian-friendly, something that young shoppers are most in demand.
In addition, fragrance shop, a fragrance retailer, will be testing relief-priced goods at two stores in Sainsbury, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying a small amount of food daily from a local convenience store mean supermarkets have more to do to get people to sign up for their store.
Sainsbury CEO Mike Coop, Aldi and Lidlhas said that stores selling their goods will look more like malls as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discounted establishments like more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury, which bought both chains two years ago, is buying Argos, which sells its products in hundreds of stores, and has introduced a number of Habitats, which it says have made it more profitable to help retail and acquire.
Previous attempts at modernizing its beauty and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury tried a spin-off with Boots in early 2000, but the company folded after a dispute over how its pharmacies share revenue from its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its 281-shop pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million.
Lloyds said that a feature of the design will be implemented by adding an extended series of luxury leather paints from La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands.
Paul Mills Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's supermarket chain, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our channels, including our image-based platforms, to improve the environment for our customers.
Specialised assistants are also being hired to provide advice.
Our brands are designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations are a visual destination that will attract more consumers who are now challenging us to shop the old fashioned way".
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willowby withdrew his £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones, television presenter Holly Willoughby, has been angered after withdrawing his £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't really have time for their furniture and accessories brand.
The couple's business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning news anchor used her Instagram account to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby's exit from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute angered Dragons' star Peter Jones - to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when she said on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she did not have time to devote time to their furniture and jewellery brands due to new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The venture was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and gave Willoughby the pleasure of doubling his fortune by an estimated £11bn.
Willoughby, 37, went to his Instagram account to announce his actual departure, and Jones flew out of Britain on a jet to visit one of his vacation homes.
"In fact, in many ways, Holly's top priority was to make a living", said a source.
It was her long-term future, where she could be seen for the next two centuries.
Her decision to withdraw was a complete shock to everyone involved.
Since it was so close to launching, no one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
"There is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at Marlow Headquarters".
Experts believe the departure of this morning's news anchor, who is Britain's top money-making star, could lead to millions of losses for the company due to a large investment in a range of products from mattresses and candles to textiles and furniture, and the possibility of further delays in its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, have been closely associated with his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production.
Willoughby was to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not comment on his business activities".
After a serious conversation, we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of the president for making a statement that some considered unreasonable and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so backward?
Trump told his humorous "news anchor" in a voice.
"I have left nothing behind".
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump sees as a major step towards the nuclear elimination of North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament is still pending.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ryong-yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday that the United States would not see a response to the preliminary steps to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the meeting.
"We will do great with North Korea", he said.
We were preparing for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
Now we have this great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results - including ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of American troops to their country.
He defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this crowded theater, we're going to keep 200 here", Trump said, pointing straight at the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake killed hundreds and destroyed an island.
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared for international relief.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it is very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Zumba died.
Save the Children is sending a team to Pallu, and it is not yet clear if foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Indonesian officials are approaching Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to contribute to relief efforts, said National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country's preparedness for the natural outbreak is at a tragically low level.
A tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, but it is not common on other beaches.
Even if an alarm is triggered, the absence of tsunami warning tubes in Palu could cause deaths.
In many periods, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters complicate the transportation of goods.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok was on its way to Palu to treat the victims of the earthquake, but it would take at least three days to reach the scene of the new tragedy.
The improvement of Indonesia's underdeveloped infrastructure has been a focus of the campaign by President Joko Widodo, who has invested in highways and railways.
But Mr. Joko is running for re-election next year and his administration is suffering from a lack of funds.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted the more traditional form of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs used sharp weapons, bow and arrow and other violent weapons to kill over 1,000 people and displace tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Stridge of Liverpool, Chelsea, has reduced the depth of the match against Pelé.
In the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Stridge scored a goal against Chelsea to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat.
Stridge was offered a ball from Sheldon Shakire, about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the remote pole.
It moved towards the upper right corner of the net, and the effort went over the box.
The ball eventually fell over the dash of Arisabala and fell into the net.
"It's just an attempt to get the ball to the point where players like Shark always play it as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible myself", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Cante came forward and saw one floor being thrown, but he hit it so carefully".
In the 25th minute, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the semi-final after scoring a goal from Belgian football star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a return bid to Matteo Kowalski in the same round of play before spinning near midfield and spinning to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick delivery and run in midfield.
He then led Hassad into the fort and made a beautiful throw of the ball.
Hassad overcame the security measures and crossed Allison Baker in Liverpool, with a left foot hit, and entered the net from the pole.
Liverpool will play Napoli at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm in San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videtons in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday that the total number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
In a press conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Ngroho said that many were trapped among the debris of buildings that were hit by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which caused waves of about 20 feet high.
The ruins of collapsed buildings were scattered throughout the city of Pallu, with a population of over 380,000.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Burknham.
She was found at 7.55am on John Street in Grayson Moose with a knife wound and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police have asked the people of the area to report to anyone who has seen or heard anything related to this.
Detective Police Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone near John Street in Burknham to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
I would like to ask anyone, including taxi drivers who have recorded anything with the dash cameras, to contact us, as they may have information necessary for our investigation".
The woman is confirmed to be a resident of the Burkenhead area and her body was found in a property, a police spokesman confirmed.
Friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask where they found her this morning.
Police said the victim's immediate family is being briefed and the investigation is ongoing.
Police have announced that a taxi driver from Grayson Mews has been denied entry or exit into the building while attempting to re-enter his apartment.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to be allowed back in.
A police officer told one person that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman stood there crying.
"It's very dangerous", she continues.
Around 2 p.m., two police vans were in the security ring and another van was nearby.
A number of officers were in the security ring to monitor the blockade.
Anyone with information will be asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crime Prevention Department anonymously by posting note 247 on September 30 at 0800 555 111.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest memorial in the line of 'Rewrite History'.
His exile would serve as a poetic justification for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious monuments by his extremist Puritan followers in a Taliban fashion.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as nonsense and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Club, said: "The current debate over the removal of the cinema was inevitable, with the image of Oliver Cromwell being targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or execute the destruction of statues during the English Civil War.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell sacrificed himself for the deed of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The impressive representation of Cromwell by Sir William L. Thornecroft is a testament to 19th century opinion and is part of a historical record of a character that many believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "In the late 19th century, Cromwell was considered by many, in Parliament, as a defender of the state's sovereignty against external influences, at this point.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a characteristic figure who represents one side of that division.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as a Chief of Defence".
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer.
According to a local media report, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, known only by the surname Yuan, was found dead of a massive blood clot near a pigsty in a market in Liufengzhou, Guizhou Province.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 at a pig farm in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly arrived at the market with a cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from the neighboring province of Yunnan.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and a door to the nearby pigs' enclosure was opened.
He said that a large male pig with blood on his jaw was in the pigsty.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the farmer was beaten to death by a 550-pound pig.
The Guardian quoted a cousin, nicknamed "Wu", as saying, "My cousin's legs were bleeding and crushed".
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the police were gathering evidence at the scene and that the pig had locked up the premises separately to prevent an attack on another person.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly in talks about compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig had driven a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife screamed and drove the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as a blood-tasting catalyst.
They're playful.
They're cute, they're very careful... they're not trying to hurt you.
"You have to take good care of them", he said.
Hurricane Rosa is about to bring heavy rain across the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves through the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
By 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Hurricane Rosa had developed into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, and was located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tropical depression is beginning to form above the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Tropical Storm Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, deep tropical moisture will begin to push northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Interaction with the approaching rainfall will result in heavy rainfall spreading to the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can also lead to dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the risk of desert flooding.
Rainfall rates reach 2 to 3 inches per hour for spots in deep tropical humidity, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
The scattered nature of tropical rain can lead to sudden flooding with rapidly declining conditions.
Walking through the desert with the threat of tropical rainfall would be a dangerous, foolish act.
Heavy rainfall can cause rivers to swell in size, and thunderstorms and dust storms can result in strong winds and thunderstorms.
The approaching traitor will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
More than half an inch of rainfall may occur, which may lead to a small amount of debris flowing and slippery roads.
This is likely to be the first wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday before the rainfall spreads more widely on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will continue in four directions until Wednesday.
While the Arctic will cool down in October, extreme temperature changes will be seen across the United States, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This may cause large temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a massive temperature change across the central United States.
Temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and Des Moines, St. Louis and Iowa, are 20 degrees.
In the coming days, we will try to build a lasting summer heat and expand again.
With a wide expansion from the southern plains to the northeastern regions in the 1980s, most areas of the central and eastern United States will expect warming to begin by October.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a higher probability of normal temperatures in the eastern United States for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
The appeal by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blaisey Ford, was viewed by more than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the incident at the last minute on Friday: Political stance continued as broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for a deal drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake on behalf of the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations.
Kavanaugh told the Ford Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure he caught her at a high school party while drunk and tried to save her clothes.
Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent convinced that it had not happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people will be watching it on Friday.
The average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC was calculated by the company.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen Institute generally has some limitations on counting people who visit their offices.
To get an idea, it's the same audience size as a football playoff or Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader of all networks in a day-long trial with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with a 3.26 million viewership.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC has 2.89 million subscribers, and CNN has 2.52 million subscribers.
After the trial, interest was high.
The central character in Friday's play was Flake.
After the office of the Republican-Neutral Party issued a statement that he voted for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him accusing protesters of climbing the elevator to attend a jury trial on Friday morning.
He was knocked out and watched live on CNN.
"I stand before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power when many women have no power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying that before the elevator was shut down, he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was to vote to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate vote, all cable and broadcast networks were broadcast live for hours afterwards.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI understood that charges against the nominee for the Democratic minority party's next week were being investigated.
Flake was partially convinced of this by his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Kuns and several senators, Flake made his decision.
It was clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation, so Flake had the power to choose.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing a "political game" on Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of playing a political game with Britain's future and undermining the nation's good.
Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party summit in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Checker's plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to add tariffs to each other was "completely fraudulent".
Shot to death by Wade Sims: LSU player suspected of killing Ditiane Simpson is arrested by police
A suspect has been arrested by police for the fatal shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Damien Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Sims clash, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, which contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to fatally shooting Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to a lawyer's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Corps released a preliminary report Friday saying the death was caused by gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Extension Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the Department of Public Safety are grateful for their support in the investigation that helped lead to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement agencies for their diligence and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wade's death had devastated the team and left the team in shock.
"You're always worried about this", Wade said.
The volcano has spread ash to Mexico City.
The 20th Grey reaches the southwestern neighborhood of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano due to the activity of the crater, which reported 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of collisions and tremors.
Social media images show thin gray layers of car windshields in neighboring areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted that the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, has been increasing in activity since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the rebel police, and thousands marched to celebrate the first anniversary of the vote to separate Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists held by the riot police attacked them with eggs, throwing powdered ink and creating dark dust clouds on the streets, often filled with tourists.
Later that day, the police also clashed with the police using their baton poles to control the fighting.
For more than a few hours, pro-independence groups cried out "Let's not forget, let's not forgive" and faced union protesters shouting "May Spain live long".
Local newspapers reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions in the Free Zone are high, a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of anti-secessionists voted against the vote, but the majority chose to remain independent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop voting in violent clashes at polling stations across the region last year.
Independent-minded groups have been camping on Friday night to prevent a protest in support of the National Police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Terms, a 68-year-old electrical engineer, joined his wife in a separatist campaign and said he was no longer hopeless about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we lived through one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry over the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite managing a very important but decisive victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan Independent-Friendly Parties have this year struggled to retain power in the face of the typo-forced deportation or referendum of many of their prominent leaders, and the subsequent detention in custody in anticipation of a trial for declaring independence.
Joanne Puyge, a 42-year-old technician who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", he said.
O'Reilly, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial since late last year, announced on Saturday that O'Reilly Junqueras will run for the European Parliament election next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline and repression of democratic values we have seen in the Spanish parliament", he said.
Men were arrested after a car hit a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being continuously hit by a car in a house in Londry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinegard Crescent.
The damage to the gates and the building was reported by Detective Bob Pleming.
The car may have been hit by a crossbow.
With Menga's strike, the Rangers beat the Bengals 1-0 to win the League over Livington.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the title.
Livingston surprised the Rangers by promoting him to manager of the Ibrox club for the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games.
Gary Holt's side was tied with Hibernation in second place, which proved Dolly Manga's strike was different.
Gerard's team will remain undefeated in the Championship this season and will face forward Hearts who will be pursuing eight points behind next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rapids were hosted by Rangers in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have extended their unbeaten run to six games this season, and Holt is still enjoying a losing streak after replacing head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses his chances against Blunt Vittors.
Their directness caused the Rangers all sorts of problems and Holt's team had to move on much earlier to score.
Scott Robinson was successful, but his effort was pulled across the board, and Alan Litgo was later able to lead his effort more widely after slipping across the board to meet Craig Halcott's advance.
The hosts were pleased to allow Rangers players to play in front of them, knowing that they could discomfort guests with their playful style.
That's how the critical sphere came about.
The Rangers took a free kick, and Livingston started and DeKlan Gallagher and Robinson joined the manga, which scored a touchdown in the middle of the box.
By that point, the Rangers had retained their dominance but were unable to break the host team's defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was often uncomfortable.
Despite the forced rescue of Alfredo Morelos from Kelly, the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman's strike was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's foot, while Litgo struck out in another regular-season swing at Livingston.
Cross-blowing continued to enter the Livingston Castle, which was consistently prevented, and two penalty requests - following Halcott's challenge over replacement Glenn Middleton and one for touch with the ball - were abandoned.
The 'miracle' of Livingston - Analysis
Allard Lamont of the BBC Scotland service from the Tony MacArony Stadium
The miraculous performance and results of Livingston.
To a man, they are the great ones who have exceeded expectations on this journey upward.
Their style and personalities have not changed since their return to the top, but he deserves credit for the strength of the team since Holt's arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcott was a highly organized and unlimited protector, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell fully prepared.
But the Rangers were less relaxed.
As good as they were under Gerard, they fell below those standards.
Their last chance was lost - they only managed to win the host race once - and the Rangers were called to wake up in the middle of it.
Erdogan is receiving a mixed reception in Cologne.
On Saturday, September 29, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast, where there was a warm and friendly atmosphere.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit to the country, which was intended to renew relations between NATO allies.
They had disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdoğan left for Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police offered security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from coming to the mosque, but a large number of supporters were nearby to visit his president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - protested against Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to recognize him.
These hateful protests reflect the duality of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced as an autocrat by others.
The bicycle driver died in a car crash in Deptford
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, southwest of the city.
The driver of the car was stopped and medical personnel arrived, but he died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist fled the Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The city police said that the authorities were working to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Buses are being diverted and roadblocks are being made, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Larrettin Prison: Six officers were injured in a riot
The Bureau of Prisons said six prison officials were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison.
The situation at HMP Long Lairtin, Worcestershire, has been disturbed since 09:30 BST and continues to be disturbed.
Special forces from the Tornado have been called in to deal with the riots, including eight inmates from each unit.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the time.
A prison service spokesperson said: "HMP has deployed a specially trained prison staff to handle an ongoing incident in Long Laird.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the violence in our prisons and the responsible will be turned over to the police and will likely spend long periods of time in jail.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden, who was attacked by a prisoner, was hospitalized.
In October last year, the prison was also called upon to suppress the serious riots caused by the pool balls being used against the staff.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to cause flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which may be beneficial to drought-affected areas)
Arizona is seldom subject to tropical depression, but it is likely to occur early next week due to the residual energy of Hurricane Rosa, which is haunting the southwestern desert, threatening rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood water alerts for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, northern California and Utah, on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain-bound tropical storm is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm 40 miles from the AZ border".
With up to 6 inches of isolated rainfall in Morgan Rim, Arizona, the latest National Hurricane Center forecast is 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Other areas of the desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Smoky Mountains, can be found at depths of 1 to 2 inches with a total isolation of up to 4 inches.
Rainfall from the storm rose on areas that are not at risk of flooding is a blessing because those areas are affected by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, this report will be effective in some areas, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Survey, less than 40 percent of Arizona's state experiences severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of the storm Rosa leads us through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With maximum winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa is still in the grip of a hurricane, moving northward at 12 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, and therefore has less power.
Therefore, during the mid-afternoon or late afternoon of a tropical storm, sewerage is expected in Mexico.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall may result in significant flooding.
The weather.com reported that rainfall is expected to fall from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonara, with a drop of 10 inches.
Hurricane Rosa will follow a tropical depression as a tropical storm through Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, and then it will follow south through Arizona into midnight Tuesday.
"The main hazard that can be expected from Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is the severe rainfall in the northwestern suburbs of Baja California and the southeastern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is expected to cause immediate flooding of rivers and waste streams in the deserts and sewerage in the mountainous terrain.
In the middle of the summer, Norton attack: Four attempted murderers arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy in Somerset was found with a knife wound.
The young man was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He's been admitted to the hospital where he'll remain in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radsstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The authorities have asked anyone with a cell phone record of the incident to come forward.
Trump says the Democratic Caucus is "suffering, humiliation, anger".
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and unethical tactics, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that the Democratic caucus has suffered anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, quickly and emotionally denying the accusation that Christine Blazey Ford sexually assaulted him as a teenager decades ago.
Ford testified against her in court.
The President said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm a lawyer with the most talented legal minds of our time, with an excellent record in public service", he told a group of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that Democrats were engaged in a campaign of resistance and disruption.
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major Senate voting procedure on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on or before Friday.
Hundreds died in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the magnitude is rising.
A major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, killing at least 384 people and leaving many injured by massive waves hitting the coastline, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of about six metres (18 feet) in the evening hit the beach, killing many and destroying everything found.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were no longer on the beach without leaving and they became victims", said Sutopo Parvo Ngroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, at a meeting in Jakarta.
Noting that the tsunami hit the coast at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour), Ngrohho said, "The tsunami did not come alone, it pulled cars, badges, houses and hit everything on the ground".
He said that some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges crumbled and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city was hit by a series of earthquakes on Saturday.
A region of 2.4 million people felt a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical location at the end of a long, narrow bay has likely increased the size of the tsunami.
The damage was "extensive", and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, Ngrohho said.
He said that several bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, injuring 540 people and missing 29.
The city of Donggala, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palou, is the epicenter of the earthquake, and the area known as Donggala, said that the number of casualties and damage could increase.
The communication from Donggala has been "completely inactive without any information", said Ngrohho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, and that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"It's already been a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami in Palu, but officials said the waves came during the time of the warning.
An amateur video circulated on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building being able to hear the alarms of a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water will break down on the beach and destroy buildings and cars.
Reuters News Agency was unable to confirm the sighting immediately.
The power outages caused by the earthquake and tsunami cut off communication around the fault, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but rescued people still need food and other basic facilities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the detention centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The total number of tsunamis in Indonesia is over 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision staff arrived safely in the city of Pallu, where employees are staying in cotton tents set up in their office windows, and on their way, they witnessed scenes of destruction, Douseba said.
"They told me that they saw a number of houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Although aid groups have begun their efforts to initiate disaster relief, some have accused highly skilled foreign aid workers of preventing them from reaching Pallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only be started if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It never happened.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Olia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"We may be open to international support once the government says this is a national disaster, but there is no such situation yet".
As the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday dawns on the town of Pallu, the friends and family of the still missing look forward to the dark miracles that will make their loved ones the victims of natural disasters.
A little boy was picked up in a garbage dump on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days, and was close to her mother's body.
Two para-gliders trained by Jendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, for the Asian Games, which began earlier this year, are missing.
The other people trapped at the Rowa Rowa Hotel were Mr. Mandagee and his students.
"As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional touch", he said.
Mr Jendon recalled how hours after the news of the Rowa Rowa Hotel's collapse spread among the paragliding community, he sent tough WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who were attending the beach show.
His messages resulted in a pair of blue markings, not a gray mark.
"I think the idea is that the messages are not received", he said.
Thieves receive $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport, Levy.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, $26,750 was stolen from a Bronx employee who was depositing money into an ATM in Levi's, Newport, on Friday morning.
The car's driver has been preparing to empty an ATM at the amusement complex and add more cash, inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was there, another man ran behind the Bronx employee and stole a purse of money he was about to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Y.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to "Yay".
Announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed "Y" for a while and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change will come before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he hopes to release his new album, "Jungi".
The show's creator said he will replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for natural reasons.
As an acronym for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word is of religious importance to him.
"I believe the most commonly used word in the Bible is 'ye', meaning 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking to the Big Boy radio announcer about the title of his album.
So I am where you are, I am where we are, this is about us.
It became a can, a single person, a reflection of all of our good, bad, complexity.
This album is a reflection of who we are going to be.
He's one of many rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P.D.D., or Diddie, but he expressed his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
West's collaboration with JAY-Z also created a name with or without capital letters.
AMLO, Mexico, pledges not to use military force against civilians.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students approaches.
Last Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful protest campaign was being held in the Square, a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America, and the military attacked and killed about 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to create a favorable environment for young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to the students and opening more public universities that offer free education.
He said that unemployment and declining educational opportunities attract young people to gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI professional who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the United States should double its research spending on AI as China shows increased activity on AI.
Opinions emerged after various U.S. government parties announced AI, and commented that the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: they aim to become the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
With all other countries far behind the United States, doubling the budget for AI research will be a good start, and we expect the next rapid leap in artificial intelligence, Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding would double the potential for the next big AI victory from the United States.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, an investment firm in China's most powerful AI-related company Face++.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, Ohou developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American athlete, and was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
The previous U.S. government had praised technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when such a competition would be held again to identify future prospects.
Lee said that researchers in the United States would have to work hard to get government grants.
It's not China that takes out scientific leaders; it's companies that do, Liu Li said.
Recently, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited faculty from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee says that changing immigration policy will also help strengthen U.S. AI-related exercises.
I think people with PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically get a green card, he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development plan.
Li said that while the Chinese Natural Science Foundation funds individuals in educational institutions, the quality of education in China is poor, in a similar way to the way researchers in the United States are funded by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that aims to involve industry partners and scholars. The White House also announced the establishment of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced that this month it will invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation, which currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no activity has been reported for months on the U.S. law, which was enacted with the intention of creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians last Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country from the Republic of North Macedonia, a decades-long dispute with Greece that has hampered its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, was denied entry into NATO and the European Union, saying that the name of its northeastern neighbor also represents claiming its territory.
Although the two states reached an agreement on the proposed new name, nationalist opponents argued that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and has raised doubts about whether he will be able to get the minimum 50 percent required to validate the referendum in the face of the strike action.
The referendum read: "Do you accept the agreement with Greece and consent to NATO and EU membership?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable price to pay for entering institutions such as the European Union and NATO, a state that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Macedonia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the young generation in Macedonia, so that they can live freely and united with the EU, and that we all can be safer", said Oliveira Jorjeveska, 79, of Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said that the results of the vote will be updated to decide on this matter.
The name change must be done by a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The state election commission announced that no irregularities had been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, the total votes cast so far were only 16 percent compared to the current 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, which saw 66 percent of the vote cast.
Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje, said that because the children came to vote, we should belong to Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, voted in a referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, opening the doors to Macedonia to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
Vladimir Kvardarkov, 54, in front of the Parliament in Skopje, was setting up a small platform and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by the strikers.
"We would like to enter NATO and the European Union, but not through the back door", said Kemerkov, holding his head up.
We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they can't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will agree with this, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", said Saiyev in his vote.
He said that the answer was yes. Our future will be a confirmation.
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the number of voters who took part in the referendum was between 30 and 43 percent, which is less than necessary.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of respondents were ready to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, the referendum must have a turnout of 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow to a loyalist Western government that took power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City travels all over the Brighton area to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling lost in the Brighton Rovers in a 2-0 win at Manchester City Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero, who scored his goal in the 65th minute, showed it to be unusually easy.
At the start of the series, the Argentine striker got the ball in the midfield.
He runs through Brighton's guard and follows the open ground.
Then Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one guard before crossing the last few gates of Fort Brighton.
Then he looked at Sterling and moved the ball to his left.
Stirling touched the box and again directed the ball towards Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and threw the ball right-footed into the net.
Aguero is suffering from a leg problem, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him as a student.
But the first advantage in the Premier League was won by Sterling.
The sphere arrived in the 29th minute.
In the middle of the Brighton area, Aguero got the ball.
He moved the ball to the left of Leroy Sunny as a pinch hitter.
Sunny touched the ball a few times before Sterling was sent to a remote location.
The Sky Blue team didn't let the ball out, they threw it into the net.
On Tuesday, the Champions League will be played between Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany, and Hofheim.
Scherzer needs a tough game to win against the Rockies.
The Nationals have stopped their fight against each other, so there was no need to start again.
But the always competitive Scherzer is looking to compete against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies respond to it one level more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies played at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but still struggle to win the division title.
Even if we don't win here, it will be important to know the situation in Denver with the team, and by playing with the best team, we can be prepared to face any situation.
So there's no reason not to compete.
The National Team will officially announce this on Sunday, but Scherzer has reportedly been given the opportunity to comment.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, has been training before Thursday and will usually have one Sunday off training.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections, the President indirectly commented on the situation regarding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we did will be put into question in November.
We have five weeks left until the most important election of our lifetime.
This is the biggest one we have, -- I'm not just running this, because it's so important, I'm looking for the best candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see these devastating radical Democrats, you see it happening now.
They're trying so hard to regain power, you can see the lowliness and the ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, they do whatever they want to get power and control, that's all they want, power and control, we won't give it to them.
The Democrats are trying to get us to do the opposite, he said.
"You've seen it in the last four days", he continued, "and he calls the Democrats angry, lowly, and disgusting and false".
He was deeply disturbed by the name of Dean Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Oh, what.
No, no - there was a very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a party that listens to everyone.
It is not tolerant of its speakers.
It is no surprise that activists in my area voted to block me.
In fact, I've just joined the crowd who heard that the party was no longer welcome because of the comments.
My fellow MP, John Ryan, was treated the same way because he was anti-Semitic.
When I was involved, the blockade was taken because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy spoke out against former leaders on the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and many other issues.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
In my eight years as a Labour MP, all Friday committee meetings have been the same.
Unfortunately, the situation is not the same today, and the promise of a more kind, more gentle politics was long forgotten.
The Labour Party's intolerance of dissenting opinions was increasingly manifested and every opinion was asked about whether the party leadership was acceptable.
This began a few days after Jeremy took over as leader, and the person I thought had the same political views as the colleagues had been looking for a complete reversal of my politics and a different position on the European Union, whether it was national security or the single market.
Every time I spoke publicly - whatever I said - I was attacked on social media and told that I should be removed and praised by the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the accusations and opinions that I have been made against are purely political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my fellow workers who have experienced a number of sexual or racial abuse but never recovered.
One of the most frustrating features of this political era is the normalization of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Cobb announced the need to create a culture of tolerance within the party.
The truth is that we are no longer a party that listens to everyone, and with every vote of no confidence or change in election rules, the party gets tighter.
For the past two years, I have been advised to keep my head down and not talk so much and then everything will be fine.
But I didn't come to politics to do that.
32 years ago, with my extensive schoolroom deteriorating due to Thatcher government neglect, I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy and have worked as a local councillor or minister of state to provide good public services to people with greater needs.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever seen a confusing view of my political positions and the opposition to my current leadership.
All I can tell everyone who supported Friday's motion is that I cannot understand why I waste so much time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party, at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that is damaging homes, businesses and our public service.
But in fact, my only message is to give not to the Nottingham Force but to my voters, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of removal or political gain will ever stop you from acting for what I believe is necessary for your good.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayer 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayer is on top.
Despite two attempts to alter the outcome, it is no doubt fair to go to Ether for the victory in this magnificent Tenants premiership.
Now they're in the top 10 and the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, they were led to the position of having their high scoring and opportunities to be fully exploited and their coach Peter Murphy should be satisfied with it.
We've been tested in a number of matches but we've still not lost, so I should be happy, he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Everyone deserves credit for the way they used their opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th minute jersey was replaced by Fraser Climo and Eyre came forward, but the yellow jersey for Scottish captain Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggett to make successful attempts.
Klymo led Eyer with five penalties and scored 17-5 at the break as he scored a single try before the break.
But Melrose started the second round well and was only reduced to five points by the efforts of Patrick Anderson, who was dismissed by Baggett.
After a serious accident in which Ruerid Knott was taken to hospital, the race was delayed for a long time and after a resumption, Eyer continued to progress with the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who was turned by Climo.
The Earring team's interim captain, Blair McPherson, was then awarded a yellow card, where the Melrose team under heavy pressure frustrated Bruce Colvin's efforts.
However, when Strawne Hutchison received a yellow card for a slim-tackling in the offseason, McPherson brought it back to Eyre.
After the resumption of the game, Kyle Rowe received a boxing hit from David Armstrong and Gregor Henry's attempt failed.
The actor in the game of Steel is about to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Actor in the Steel Game, Ford Kieran, is set to work in the hospitality industry with the revelation that he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old writes the popular BBC drama series with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill, where he plays the role of Jack Javis.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be its last, and Kearnen appears to be preparing for a new life after Craig Lang.
He is the director of the newly established AdriftMoren Company.
The Scottish Sun reported that Kearn was planning to join a new restaurant in Glasgow, but declined to comment.
Our Oceans: Bolivia's landlocked Pacific route to the Pacific is expected to reopen via the corridor
The sailors were on a cruise to the naval headquarters in Las Vegas.
Sea-level flags are flown in government buildings.
The naval headquarters from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon echo the motto: "The sea is ours".
It is our responsibility to get it back.
For landlocked Bolivia, the beaches became a memorial to the 19th-century conflict between Chile and the bloodshed - but they are still hoping to sail back through the Pacific.
Decades later, these expectations reached their peak as the International Court of Justice issued its decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the strength of unity and peace, and hopes for a positive outcome, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kelsadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, and the Hague Tribunal is expected to fulfill a justification for Chile's request that after decades of uncertain discussions, Bolivia be granted a sovereign route to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's president of the indigenous non-cooperation movement, which faces a controversial conflict over his re-election next year, is also at great risk of taking the decision on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts point out that the court is unlikely to give Bolivia a favorable ruling - and that nothing will change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to declare a territory of Chick and is not responsible for the outcome of any negotiations.
The International Court of Justice's decision comes six months after the final hearings, which means that the case was not a complex one, said international law expert Pas Sarate of Chile.
Bolivia's goal has been achieved in the last four years.
The problem of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration, Sarate said.
She noted that Morales' eloquent speeches also destroyed the balance of goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will have talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former Bolivian representative in The Hague, President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily swift.
Bolivia will have a unique opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile on Monday, he said, ending 139-year-old disputes and benefiting each other.
Moreover, Morales, still the most popular president in Latin America, denied using the maritime issue for political gain.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to the Pacific, he said.
This decision is an opportunity to crush the past.
North Korea says it will not achieve nuclear disarmament unless it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Yong Ho said that if he could not trust Washington, his country would never carry out a nuclear disarmament.
The United Nations General Assembly has been called upon to address the United Nations.
He also said the two rivals should keep the promises agreed at the Singapore summit.
He said this less than three months after the defunct nuclear diplomatic talks with North Korean Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Singapore.
Lee said that the challenge of pressing the North to kneel down against the continuing sanctions and the announcement of an end to the Korean War is a dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration until it takes a significant dismantling step from Pyongyang.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump need a second summit.
However, the denial of the news by Pyongnan about the arsenal, which he believes is the only way to ensure the country's security, has sparked considerable suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion houses suggest bringing a unique headgear around.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, now is the time.
Valentino and Tom Brown added a crazy-sized line of helmets to their SS19 collection, which was a Paris Fashion Week attraction.
The most impractical hats were posted on Instagram this summer, and the three designers created eye-catching designs in the fashion world.
Valentino's most notable design was a wide-winged hat with a light brown feather that completely covered the model's head.
Other clothes that were of exceptional size included pearls, a magic hat, and even pineapples, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown brought a strange line of masks that fit the coming Halloween season.
Most of the colorful masks were lipstick and more reminiscent of Hannibal's Lectors than the Early Modern style.
One design looked like a scuba diving kit with snorkels and goggles, and another design looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're looking for a stylish edition - you're in luck.
These unique hats will be on your streets, as fashion enthusiasts predict.
Hats of this size came along with a two-foot-wide, leather hat, the Kala Bombay, which was visible everywhere from Rihanna to Emily Retzkowski.
With this social media hat, which was at the top of the unprofessional ladder, came another design - a beach bag of oak that was as big as a swimsuit model.
The burnt orange leather bag with a white leather handle was a highlight of the Paris Fashion Week's SS19 collection by Jacques La Rivera.
Famous celebrity designer Luke Armitage told Female: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive next summer - the designer has made such a huge impact that the potential demand for luxury clothing cannot be ignored".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are maintaining a record of academic excellence, and continue to do so in 2018 with further impressive test results, reinforced by sport, art, music and other community-based initiatives.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represent the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are actively working to prepare their students for further and higher education as well as their chosen careers and as global citizens.
We see modern languages as a subject that is more popular and more readily available in schools as a field of education that can design and implement formal school curricula.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak in a language that a person can understand, what you say goes through his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his heart will feel it.
This teaches us very well that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to maintain relationships and gain trust with people from other countries.
Recent results of this year's exams show that languages remain at the forefront of independent schools with the highest pass rates.
68 percent of students studying foreign languages have obtained top grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a grade above Mandarin, 72 percent achieved a grade above German and 69 percent achieved a grade above French.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland will support foreign languages as a necessary skill for children and young people in the future.
As a subject of choice in the curriculum of independent schools, as elsewhere, STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are considered at the same level as the language of choice.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that 17 percent of the difficulties entrepreneurs face filling vacancies were linked to language skills deficiencies.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing number of jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
The Bible teaches that learning a second language is a lifelong skill, regardless of the profession you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad will always put a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
In a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent found that they could not speak a foreign language with the ability to have a conversation, and the only other language spoken by 15 percent was French.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching languages to children today.
In developing countries, children are more likely to find suitable jobs by being able to speak several languages.
In Scotland, the language taught in nine schools varies from one school to another.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, independent schools may offer a variety of languages and employ specialised teachers to teach them.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that prepares children for the future and perfectes them with the skills they need.
In a global business environment, languages are undeniably crucial for the future of the country, and these needs must be reflected in education.
Modern languages are considered to be international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth community.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
Labron starts his Lakers tour this Sunday in Santiago.
LeBron's debut season with the Los Angeles Lakers will end the players' long wait.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in Sunday's preseason game in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how long he'll play.
Walton told the Lakers' official website it would take more than a week and less than 48 hours.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would play for a limited time.
James was asked about the pre-game schedule for six Lakers games after training earlier this week.
I don't need pre-matches to prepare for the next level of my career, he said.
Trump's West Virginia wave, his YouTube channel
President Trump is launching his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump's first of five planned waves over the next week, with stops in several friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote on his election to fill the vacancy was temporarily suspended and Trump is building support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
The parade in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally on YouTube online via the live stream below.
Meanwhile, Trump will speak about a week-long suspension of the Senate decision-making vote over the FBI's investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court on charges of sexual assault.
But the primary purpose of these tumultuous meetings is to provide the Republicans with the support for the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign says the five-round campaign next week is aimed at keeping and expanding Republicans' majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, while strengthening volunteers and supporters.
As we move into a busy campaign, control of Congress becomes very important on his agenda, so he will travel to as many states as possible, a campaign spokesman for Trump, who declined to reveal his name, told Reuters.
Today's rally at Wesbank Arena in New Wheeling, West Virginia, will bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania to Metro News and receive media coverage in Pittsburgh.
Trump's trip to West Virginia on Saturday marks his second trip there in the past month, with more than 40 percent of the total in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator candidate Patrick Morrissey in Virginia, who is running with him to the polls.
A political scientist at West Virginia University, Simon Header, told Reuters that the president's presence here to help with the latest election was not a good sign for Morrissey.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is preparing for Sunday's game
After three one-on-one sessions, a four-man team on Saturday may be the thing needed for this Ryder Cup.
Spinning vertical village is a completely newly discovered game concept but something that players are very confident in, and this game is a perfect example of that.
Where are the Nine now?
"They had six goals, now it's four, so I think it's a bit of a village", says Jordan Spit.
The European Union has a positive position with four points ahead and 12 matches.
Speeth says the winds are low for Americans to ride their roller coasters and they have plenty to encourage.
From T to Green, Spith played a game of cat and mouse, setting an example for everyone.
The sound of the big celebrations that he made throughout his playing career, and he and Thomas scored on equal terms.
The same sound was heard when he scored 15 points and pushed the ball, showing everyone that the American team was still in the game.
"But you have to play the game, you have to worry about your own game", said Spit.
That's all these players have left now.
There are 18 holes to success.
Only Francisco Moulinary and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The beloved players of Europe are unlikely to make mistakes.
The only pair to miss the Saturday night was Mollywood, but they also missed the Saturday night and played Saturday morning, Friday evening and Friday morning.
Their upward spiral was evident when they realized that they were the only ones to beat others on Sunday and that no one but Fleetwood or Molinari could win Europe at the La Golf National.
This is often the case in other holes at the same time.
But it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Baby Watson and Web Simpson, the morning of the Forward, Sergio Garcia, had a quick farewell when paired with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard and the Swede were forced to retreat after one overtaken attack and two in the front nine.
On Sunday, however, there's no one to help you.
Watching football and Fossum matches up close is very exciting because of the interactions between the couples, the advice given, the advice not given and the immediate change of strategy.
Europe has played well as a team and has kept a significant score gap to the final, but the US team has also shown a significant battle in these phases.
Europe will keep a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is on a strong path to the final day of the Ryder Cup, with a 10-6 draw against the United States after football and Forzaum matches on Saturday.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari managed to score two victories in the National Golf Championships, defeating Tiger Woods.
Thomas Bjorne's European side, determined to win the trophy they lost two years ago, scored a 3-1 surprise miss against the Americans in the morning football match.
The United States showed strong resistance during the Fossum, winning two games, but they failed to score fewer points.
Jim Furyk's goal is to score eight points in 12 singles on Saturday to win the trophy.
The first European to score four points per game was Fleetwood, known as the Moliwoods, who became the second pair in Moulinary Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Foibles, Woods and American Bryson DeChambo were defeated by another strong 5 and 4.
Woods, who played two Saturday games, made occasional valuable strikes but lost 19 of his 29 football and soccer games, with seven straight losses.
After a break for the morning football, Justin Rose joined his colleague for the Fosum, Henrik Stenson, in a 2-1 loss to world No. 1 and No. 2 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeaca.
Europe did not find what it wanted in this sweet, windy southern suburb of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas scored two points against the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against John Graham and Ian Polter in Spain, and defeated Polter and Rory MacRoy 4-3 in Forzaum, losing both of their opening holes.
A team with four points short of the Ryder Cup was only in the tournament twice, however, Furich's goal was to win the trophy with only one point.
After two days of second best, Sunday seems to be moving even further.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally disarm without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions would increase distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances his country would never unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
At the World Organization's annual general meeting, Lee Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken significant positive steps over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, removing nuclear sites, and refraining from developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we don't see any response from the United States", he said.
"We have no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States, and under no circumstances will we disarm it".
One of the points that Re repeatedly made in his comments about North Korea's complaint about Washington's resistance to the phased approach to nuclear disarmament and the North Korean measures taken is that it has not rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament without its control, as has been done by Pyongyang in the past.
At the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 2, Lee made a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, who promised to achieve nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula and Trump promised to strengthen the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang has first abandoned its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of the strict sanctions on North Korea.
The United States will be forced to first of all to disarm nuclear weapons and to push its goal to the top, and the pressure on sanctions will be increased even further, in opposition to the declaration of an end to the war, Re said.
The idea that connections can make us known is a fantasy for those who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions increase our distrust.
The UN has not made any mention of the second summit of Kim and Trump, which was planned earlier this week.
Speaking about the meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the minister said: "If the other party to this nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States, the nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have been so blocked".
However, Lee's tone was very different from his statement last year before the UN General Assembly, in which he said that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be targeted on US soil after the senseless President Trump said Kim was a suicide bomber.
Trump praised Kim's courage to take action to disarm North Korea this year despite threatening to destroy it completely at the United Nations last year, but said they had worked on it and that the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and that it would be okay if it took two, three, or five months.
China and Russia say they should be held accountable for the actions taken by Pyongyang.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The Security Council's sanctions will continue to be enforced very strictly until we find that the disarmament has been complete, final and verifiable".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met during the UN General Assembly meeting and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, and the last trip was not as good.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming North Korea accused him of making similar claims to the murderer despite making progress.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to take steps to remove a missile site and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
Kim said the measures he expected were measures to normalize Trump's promised security pledge in Singapore and ties with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course on getting enough rest.
As a response to the growing culture of caffeinated overnight sleep for study, Howard University has introduced a new course to help graduates get more sleep.
One scientist found that students at the number one university in the world have no idea what is really important about their health.
The course was designed by Charles Seisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it will be the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after a lecture on the impact of the Nind Mandaka on learning.
A student came up to me and asked: 'Why do you tell me about this in my senior year without telling me?
She said that no one had ever told her about the value of sleep - which surprised me, he told Telegraph.
The first course, launched this year, describes the basic concepts of how adequate sleep and exercise can affect performance and teaches how to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after accepting students who had been seriously sleepless for a week.
This one-hour course will consist of a series of interactive workshops.
In one section, students will have a picture of a laboratory room and click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how little sleep affects sports performance, and the importance of maintaining a sleeping routine.
In another section, we will discuss how prolonged sleep increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, stress, and cancer.
The university has a map with interactive icons where participants are guided to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know about the health benefits of smoking, as well as about it", said Professor Seisler.
He says that the pride in the culture of sleep-over-night studying still persists, and he says that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure indicate that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that getting enough, quality sleep is a secret weapon for fighting stress, fatigue, and anxiety - important to prevent weight gain, because when you're sleepy, your brain is in fasting mode and it causes constant hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, attended Professor Seisler's classes in his first year and helped him set up the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to make it a course offered throughout the university.
The next step, he hopes, is for graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining this competitive institution.
Professor Seisler recommends that students consider keeping their alarm clock on and off the bed, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of electrical displays and blue light, which can interfere with the daily rhythm of their brain and cause sleep problems.
Menga's ball is pulling Gerard's team down.
Livingston's Dolly Menga defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 to face another tough attack on the Rangers.
The Ibrox were expected to claim their first victory since their 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team scored Gerard's second defeat.
Menga scored his goal with seven minutes left and ran the Rangers without a hit.
The Rangers will then be relegated to sixth place and Livingston to third place, only behind Hibernates in the goal difference.
Also, Rangers will be more vulnerable after being referred to the Spens for treatment of a head injury caused by a blow to the head from outside the stadium.
By the time he reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup from Ireland, Gerard had made eight changes to his record.
Holt, on the other hand, went ahead with the same 11 and scored a mark from the Hats last week, and their well-fitted outfit is a breath-taking cent to all of his opponents.
Although the Rangers were good at catching the ball, Livingston took advantage of his ball.
Menga's first stop allowed them to score when Scott pitcher Alan McGregor threw the ball into the ball, but the midfielder got his chance.
Keegan entered Jacobs' free-throw skyer Craig Hulkett, and his defensive partner was only able to jump from the rear position.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more about hope than faith.
Although Morelos felt he should be punished for his collision with Alfredo Morelos and Steven Loles, the referee, Steven Thompson, rejected the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers could hit the goal in the first half, but the previous IRB goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not as challenged as the headstroke from Cooley or the O.V. Azaria.
Although the opening shot of Levi in the 34th minute proved to be a victory against the attack, no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Rangers failed to fight Jacob's assault again.
Scott Arfield was doing nothing when DeKlan Gallagher turned the ball over to Scott Robinson and was in the middle of Mengas final lightning strike.
Gerard Ryan replaced Kent with Colibri and blocked the lucrative but dangerous game.
However, after Lithgow and Hulk had pushed the ball for a long time and the crowd was eager to watch, Livingston continued to fail to deliver the match.
Although Holt's pitch was able to increase the score gap on the way to the final stage, McGregor stood up before the head hit by Lithgow.
The Rangers asked for another penalty shot, but Thompson refused.
The inventor of the Geiger calculator
Now our Sunday morning Latin page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Johannes Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, and that discovery later evolved into a device called the Geiger calculator.
The Geiger calculator, which occupies a prominent place in science, also became a staple of popular culture. This was the case with the 1950s film The Bell of the Coronado, starring two cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is this?
This is a Geiger calculator, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
You put the earphones on a mountain and you hear the radioactivity of the minerals, the sound of atoms,
Yeah, now it's going to blow up!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his discovery will make his name immortal.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to detect dead cells.
A new cancer vaccine, the immune system can be taught to detect dead cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, this vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells.
This method takes immune cells from the patient and changes them in a lab.
They can then identify a protein common to many cancers and re-inject it.
These hand-delivered vaccines have been shown to be effective in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with this vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells, discovered that her ovarian cancer had been gone for 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are removed from the patient, where they are modified in the lab to detect the HER2, a protein common to most cancers, and the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine can make us live up to expectations".
HER2 leads to the development of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and prostate cancers, explained Professor Bursovsky.
The use of immune cells from patients and training them to attack cancer cells has also been successful in treating leukemia.
Kanye West, after the SNL show, wears a magha hat and is in a Trumpist critique.
It didn't go well.
After being praised by US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020, Hooked up against Kanye during a Saturday Night Live show.
That night, wearing a "Maga" hat, he was shouting at Democrats and showing his support for Trump after Ghost Town was performed as the third song.
Every time I talk to a white man, they ask, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
"If I had thought about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
The SNL program was launched by Christine Blaisey Ford in a satirical Matt Damon satire that mocked Brett Cano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over a sexual assault charge.
Although West's performance was not broadcast, it was leaked to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock made this statement to mock West.
West also told his audience that his head covering made him difficult to see behind the scenes.
They mocked and tortured me behind the stage.
They said you shouldn't wear a hat.
They hurt me!
Then they said I was in a bad place, and the Washington Examiner reported it.
West continued: "Do you want to see where failure is? I can wear my Superman logo, you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to see the world move forward?
You can love me.
His comments were heard twice in the SNL audience, and the members seemed to be in a state of distress, one of whom reportedly stated: "The entire studio was submerged in a deep silence".
The late rapper Mac Miller came as a West substitute to replace his girlfriend Ariana Grande.
Dressing in a bottle of perfume, West posed a question for many with the song "I Love It".
In support of the Conservative leader, Candace Turner West, TPUSA, tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing up against the unrest".
But the host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just acting the same way, and it was really beautiful.
But I would never support anyone who I believe is holding a dispute that is damaging to my community (by supporting his art or buying his music or clothes).
He's free.
We did, too, she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name and would now officially be known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following in the footsteps of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. D. D.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, and the musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, later to Prince.
Charges of murder against the knife-wielding incident at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder following a knife attack at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident took place in Ballyhakarmore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
These charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harington is a man of evil.
Kate Harrington brings to life the character of John Snow, the sword-switcher in the violent medieval fantasy saga HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor speaks against the standard of a tough hero and says that by showing such characters on screen, the message is that the tough must be tough to be honored.
Commenting on the Sunday Times column, Keith said that a mistake had been made and questioned how to address the toxic issue of the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, a co-star in Game of Thrones, said he felt compelled to work on the matter.
I feel personally and strongly at this moment where we have made mistakes about being men?
What did we teach the men who were raised to this question as they grew up?
Keith suggests that the more masculine characters on television should be responsible for the toxicity of this man.
He continued: "What is the Kingdom, and what is it taught?
The young boys on the street and on television are learning that we must build ourselves up to be men.
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - how should we change this?
Because something is clearly wrong with the young boys.
During the interview, he acknowledged that he will not participate in the pre- or post-Games of Thrones, which ends next summer, saying that his time with battlefields and seats is over.
Starting November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of his brother, a filmmaker and thief.
He recently revealed that the best thing he had ever received from Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife here, and that's how it gave me my future family and then my life", he said.
Rose played Yigrith, the love interest of John Snow in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has reported a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, there are more than 820,000 cases across the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, indicating a different state from the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV spreads rapidly through infected blood transfusions.
But a Chinese health official said at a conference in Yunnan province that this had reduced HIV infection to a drop.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV has become a major problem among the LGBT, transgender and heterosexual communities in China.
In 1997, China removed the criminalization of homosexuality, but discrimination against the egalitarian, discriminatory, transgender community is widespread.
Studies have estimated that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the traditional values in the country.
These diseases are most commonly transmitted by the lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the WHO has promised to provide universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP Senator's information was leaked by a member of the staff, through the bursting of dangerous hoaxes and gilded theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied last Saturday allegations that a member of her staff posted information on three Republican U.S. Senators on the pages of the legislature's Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party said that the charges were being made by far-right clerics and websites.
In a tweet, Waters said: "Mozish, mosish and very juicy mosishes".
The release of the information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The release came shortly after the three senators were interviewed.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate reported that the sources of these posts were linked to Waters' offices, and Hill reported that information about a member of Waters' staff had been released.
"These unproven allegations are completely false and false", Waters said.
The identity, personal information and security of a member of my staff are compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, and the member is not responsible for any release of this information.
These unproven allegations are completely false and false.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is outrageous", wrote Fletcher.
This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
If someone accuses another person of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They don't have to object.
They should not question the intentions of the accuser.
They must be calm and calm.
The response of Fletcher Waters, who was furious at Thursday's trial, appeared to be a attempt to match criticism of the judge, who was accused of being a critic of the jury.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, posted his comments on Twitter.
The truth is, it's huge, he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said she had informed the authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent allegations.
We guarantee that these criminals will be soon exposed, she said, and that they will be held accountable for their activities, which are devastating and dangerous to anyone and everyone on my staff.
Johnny English Strike is a spy who is powerless.
It is now common to associate Brexit with any new British-oriented film, including the 2003 comeback of the action-comedy series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny Englishborn and ended in 2011.
Does this self-deprecating comedy show how meaningless we as a nation are in the new exporting world?
The eye-catching, rubber-faced, unskilled Johnny English has been given his second license to do everything wrong - the main thing that the name indicates is that it is a comprehensive comedy created for the non-English speaking film audience.
He's actually a silly detective with a bit of a mouthful of clowns, Mr. Bean and a man playing Charities of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He also based the mystery of the man and the traveller in the now-defunct Atkinson-starring Barclays TV commercial.
There are a couple of great moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I love the medieval costume of Johnny flying to the English helicopter and having the helicopters attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to present physical humor is well illustrated, but it is now considered a classic, with comedy being incorporated into films such as 007 and Mission Impossible, which make the satire seem somewhat powerless and oversized.
The irony here seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and I find Johnny English's absurd mistakes, Mr. Bean's silent performance, not as creative and innovative as Atkinson's.
This timely example shows that Great Britain is now in a serious crisis.
A cyber hacker breaks into a top-secret British intelligence network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the field, sparking the fear of a busy agent, a very small feat for Kevin Eldon.
It marks the final nail in the coffin of the then politically disillusioned and suffering from total deviation, the depressed prime minister: Emma Thompson, who plays the part of half-Theresa, is doing very well in the role but she has little to do in the script.
Her intelligence advisers say that since every spy has been captured, a retired spy should be brought in.
The man is employed as a school teacher at an important institution - but secretly teaching him to operate - John English: here are some of the idioms of teaching English to spy in a modern school.
He is summoned to the English White Hall for an emergency call where he is reunited with his longtime colleague, Bo (Ben Miller).
Bo is now married and his wife is a high-ranking submarine commander, and Wiki Pepperdine seems to be underutilized.
The two misfits re-enter the Queen's Secret Service, where they meet the beautiful, sexy fairy tale Ophelia Bullatova, played by Olga Kuryenko.
Meanwhile, the minister is caught by a hefty tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem; the second is played by Jake Lacy as Jason Volta.
English and Bo embark on their mysterious journey: masked waiters set fire to a French restaurant, create a huge stir on the luxury yacht of Volta, and attempt to use a virtual reality headset to gain insight into the interior of the English Volta home, becoming a total mess.
It's a final event, but it's a whole child's show.
They're all normal.
And I thought about other Johnny English films: Could the British film industry not have a character that matched Rowan Atkinson's talent and was fair to him?
Labour has denied proposals to provide four days a week pay for five days of British work.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to pay Britons four days a week and five days a week.
The party reportedly wants to direct the owners of companies to give employees a day off from the savings made through the AI revolution.
The new system will allow employees to work three days a week and receive their current salary.
According to sources, this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to direct the country to the benefit of the workers.
The idea of a four-day workweek was brought forward by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to benefit workers in the face of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "We expect to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It was not a one-day workweek, but a four-day workweek that was in line with the party's approach to economic recovery and the party's overall industrial strategy, in a way that was beneficial to the workers".
Such an idea was first proposed by the Green Party, not the Labour Party, during its 2017 general election campaign, which promised a four-day work week.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet approved this intention.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a Party policy and is not taken into account by the Party.
Photo-chancellor John McDonnell described his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a labor conference last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from the directors and beneficiaries of non-profit organizations.
Another thing that the photo-chancellor's plan meant was that current shareholders in water companies would not have to take back all their shares because they would be reduced for wrongdoing.
He also pointed out his plans to introduce employees into the boards and to set up an inter-ownership fund to provide employees with 10 percent of the private sector's total annual dividend of around £500.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy, told 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation into Keno would change his mind.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Cano has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether any Republican senator would back him in the wake of the revelations by the Bureau.
The 60-minute program airs Sunday, and reporter Scott Pelly, Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham asked if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy showed more openness than his South Carolina counterpart.
I think, really. Kennedy said.
I went to the trial and spoke to Judge Kwon.
I called him after this happened, and when this charge was filed, I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was very firm, determined and very clear in his opinion.
Graham's vote, however, seems difficult to change.
"I've made a decision about Brett Cano, which will carry a huge charge", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, Graham said, citing Blaisey Ford.
No one named him could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the Global Citizens' Day, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizens Festival, a celebrated annual music festival featuring superstars with the ultimate goal of ending global poverty.
The Global Citizenship Festival marks its seventh year and thousands of people are drawn to the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to celebrate the legacy of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advisory group that aims to increase the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants must either organize a workshop, volunteer, email a world leader, inform about the goal of ending poverty, and engage in other meaningful activities.
But how successful has the Global Citizenship Festival been in a time when it has only 12 years to reach its goals?
Is the idea of giving away a free concert ticket an authentic way to get people to do something about it, or is it just another click-through opportunity that they think will make a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens Group has reported 19 million support campaigns for various causes.
These actions have led world leaders to announce policies and special projects related to this goal, and have a combined impact of more than $3 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first half of 2018, the group indicated 390 projects that had raised or spent at least $10 billion in funding through its activities.
The group says that the funds raised have directly affected more than 649 million people worldwide so far.
Among the key projects, Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors in the United States, is dedicated to helping children grow to their full potential and has pledged $35 million to help end Rwandan malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can add the injustice of animal nutrition to history", said Tracy Ulman, a representative of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group added that after more than 5,000 such actions to encourage the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach a target of 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is, 'Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?'
Global Citizen responded: "It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we can fall and fail.
But like the great campaigns against civil rights and racism, we will succeed because we are stronger than we are by uniting.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars of this year's New York concert, which will be hosted by Deborah Lee Fernand and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use naval obstacles to block Russian energy exports.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Sinclair has said that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, if necessary, Washington Examiner reveals.
Zinc accuses Russia's intervention in Syria at the invitation of the regular government as a strategy for exploring its new energy market.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they are energy-related, as they are in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe", he said.
The officer has nine ways and means to handle the situation.
"The United States, along with our Navy, has the ability to ensure that the pipelines are open and, if necessary, block them so that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Sync announced this at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group known as the Voice of Energy Consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were similar.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use less or more leverage and fuel replacement", he said, noting that Russia is the only country capable of depending on fossil fuels economically.
The announcements came as the Trump administration sought to expand its liquefied natural gas exports to Russia, which has been the cheapest option for European consumers so far.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to withdraw from the appropriate pipeline project, the Nord Stream 2, because Trump is now in a building in Moscow, Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is planned to increase the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's strong opposition to the project is based solely on economic factors and is an example of unfair competition.
"We all agree that energy should not be used as a tool for pressure, consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Noe said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
These US actions have led to strong opposition from Germany, which has reiterated their commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industries, Germany's leading industry organization, has informed the United States to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the interference of a third state in our energy supply", said Dietter Kemf, head of the German Federation of Industries, following a recent meeting between German ambassador Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will be considering running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president after the upcoming midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was running for mayor in the Massachusetts Town Hall.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it's important for a woman to be on top", she said, according to Hill.
I am seriously considering whether to run for president after November 6.
Urbanist Warren spoke of President Trump and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "We really need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a referendum on Thursday said a majority of the nine Warren voters would not consider her running for office in 2020.
A poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe found that 58 percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for her said she should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported it.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most support during the referendum, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other top Democratic names discussed as having potential for the 2020 presidential election included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
He will make a decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at a rally of Donald Trump on the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trac Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
The pain my son is suffering, the pain he is suffering after returning, the pain of other families suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress, our soldiers come with these wounded spirits, said Donald Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
In connection with his arrest, Pauline said that it was a clear but unnegotiable issue and that her son and other veterans would return with some difference, coming from a hard heart, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other members of the military, wondering if the service to this country was honorable.
A spokesman for the Basilica Police said he was arrested last Monday in Basilia, Alaska, on charges of assaulting a woman with domestic violence, possession of a weapon while intoxicated, and so on.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting the challenge of the new care policy.
The new U.S. policy, which denies 18 states and the District of Columbia legal protection to victims of group or domestic violence, supports legal challenges.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a subpoena in Washington last Friday to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the attendee was not revealed during the August session filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy.
She claimed that her partner and her sons, gang members, abused her, but her request for asylum was denied by US officials on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers who supported Grace described that a large number of asylum seekers in the United States were from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where gangs and domestic violence have been reported.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants suffering from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racken said in a statement Friday that the new policy would disregard decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all claims for custody be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, which would violate the policy, the courtesy summary reads.
Lawyers further argued that refusing immigrants to enter the United States would harm the country's economy because immigrants often provide the labor needed by entrepreneurs and suppliers.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to provide immediate care to victims seeking asylum due to domestic abuse and gang violence.
On June 11, Sessions announced the policy, saying that people who leave their home country because of being discriminated against because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can be granted asylum.
Health care is not the solution to all the problems, including the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
With the death toll doubling, the most difficult rescue exercises in Palo are underway to find survivors.
The survivors have faced extreme conditions.
Reza Kusuma, 35, comforting her fiery son in a abandonment center in the devastated city of Palu, said: "I am under a lot of stress.
Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.
The residents seem to be moving to their destroyed homes, grabbing their wet-laden possessions and trying to rebuild everything possible.
Hundreds of people were injured and the 7.5 magnitude quake left hospitals crowded.
Two injured men, including Dwy Harris, with broken back and shoulders, are being treated outside the Falun Gong military hospital for a series of post-concussion injuries.
He was in a hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter and his eyes filled with tears as he reflected on the violent quake.
We didn't have time to save our lives.
I think I was stuck between the broken walls, Harris told the Associated Press, they were in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "blowing up" advertising.
With the publication of a four-page ad in the official Chinese newspaper, the US-China trade-rewarding US daily, the Chinese US ambassador accused Beijing of using American media for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump accused last Wednesday of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections scheduled for November 6 of this year, referring to a paid supplement to Des Moines Register, a diamond auction in Iowa.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US elections is a new stage in Washington's increasing efforts to exert pressure on China, a US official told Reuters.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, this situation is unique in that Beijing and China are currently engaged in a growing trade war and are imposing a number of taxes on each other's intentions.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that at the beginning of the trade war, counterattack tariffs were planned in China to target exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural goods to China, Terry Branstad said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a letter to the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China is now doubling the violence by posting advertisements in our own free media.
"In this campaign, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press to its advantage by posting paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Bransett wrote.
"As all media in Beijing is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, you cannot see any real representation of the Chinese people's views on China's troubled economic journey in the street newspapers", he wrote.
He also stated that a major Chinese newspaper, without naming it, had failed to publish his article.
Analysts warn that Republicans will isolate women in the midterm elections with the extreme defeat of Kono.
As many top Republicans defend and defend the sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kauno, analysts warn that they will be backed up by women in the upcoming elections.
The situation is very high and many Republicans have already declared a vote.
"Nothing is irreversible", Gran Reehr, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told Hill in a Saturday article.
Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Representative) was the last-minute FBI inquiry, but it was questionable whether it was enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and November, said Karen Jean Pierre, national spokeswoman and senior adviser for the pro-life movement MovOn, on Friday, according to The Washington DC Times.
On Friday morning, protesters protested outside the Senate chambers, shouting "November is coming!" as the Republicans controlled the court to proceed with the nomination of Keno despite evidence provided by Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford.
"The enthusiasm of the Democrats is very high", said neutral political analyst Stu Rothenberg to a news website.
People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can go even higher, especially among those in suburban areas who are not in a position to vote and young people between the ages of 18 and 29 who don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford made public sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said there could be some setback if Republicans continue to confirm.
This has caused a stir for the Republican Party, said former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steel, according to NBC News.
This is not a question of whether the committee will be voted on or final or audited, it's a question of how the Republicans have handled it and how they have handled her, Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that supports the nomination of Democrats, told a news channel.
However, in the face of the evidence of Ford and Cano, the question has been raised as to who the Americans should believe, even though most people are for Cano.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent firmly or frequently accepted Ford's testimony and 35 percent firmly or frequently believed Kono.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said they were often or definitely wrong in their testimony, while 30 percent said Ford was.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford and allegations made by Deborah Ramirez.
In her oath of office to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Ford said she was influenced by Cano's drinking when she was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when he was teaching at Yale University with her in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a new Internet to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology legend, the latest project of Man, Inprint, is creating the open source platform of Burns Lee, Solid.
Solid allows its users to choose where they want to store their data and also to choose which person can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burns Lee jokingly said that the idea of Inprint is to control the world.
"We must do it now", he says of his origin.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to create people's own personal online database, or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all on one browser at a time.
The unique feature of a personal online database is that it is entirely user-friendly to choose which data to access.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
John Bruce, CEO of Inprint, said his idea was that the company should bring the resources, processes and skills needed to deliver Solid to everyone.
At the moment the company consists of a security platform purchased from Burns Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of developers and volunteer coders contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inprint website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't talk about making or not making a complete difference with Facebook and Google because all their business models are upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Saturday's Medium, Burns Lee states that the mission of Inprint is to protect the authenticity and quality of the new web built on Solid by providing a commercial energy and ecosystem for the moon.
In 1994, the Internet was completely transformed by the founding of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Berners-Lee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent years, Burns Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
While launching Inprt, Burns Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the Web", said Berners-Lee.
WW1 Victory Cross Chapel
The first Church of England chaplain to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his service as a soldier in World War I is celebrated in his hometown for almost 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal for his actions in the Battle of Belangelis and Lechkot on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he died in a sniper's attack, unaware that he had been awarded this highest British war honour.
His two grandsons opened a memorial to him on Saturday in the Rusden War Memorial in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the unveiling of the monument 100 years after the battle that honored his ancestors was symbolic.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van Dijk was leading his army through the Canal de Saint Quentin amidst fog and the onslaught of battlefield and machine gun fire.
He then ran to the firing range and bravely advanced, using a field gun alone, defeating three armies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed in a German sniper attack on 4 October 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says that I never could forgive the actions of my ancestors, but that they had a profound effect on us.
He and his brother Dr. James Van wore a flower ring led by the Britonwood Imperial Youth Orchestra after the farewell march.
Michael Van said, "It was a great honor to be part of this greeting parade and the award was well-deserved by a large crowd for a brave and genuine hero".
MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 get a Peppa Pig instead.
Think about it, you'll be up all night watching Ballerina 2016 and you'll find out you're not going to be able to watch the main event at the end.
The San Jose Playlist included 13 matches, including six major matches, and was shown on five UK channels.
At 6pm, when the Gegars Moses and Rory McDonald were about to face each other, the UK audience was thrilled with the simultaneous broadcast of Peppa Pig on the channel.
Some who had fallen asleep for the match were disappointed.
One of the fans of the game on Twitter said that the transition to this children's cartoon was "crazy".
In an interview, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said that if existing programs are not suitable for children by 6 p.m., it is a government regulation to switch to a children's program.
- What? - What?
Bill Carter, president of BellTrader, says he will be working on his timeline in the future, including US visitors.
"Every time I think about a new adventure, I think that something can be done about it", said Cocker.
But I don't think we can do anything until their Sunday morning, Sunday our time, and Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
After the game change, there were a lot of messages, none of which were friendly.
We're trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it's not, it's a government issue.
I can promise you it won't be the next time.
We're trying to keep it five games instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to make this a little bit more for our fans, but it's unnecessary.
This is a sad situation.
Tom Daly had a nightmare about sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Dalley says that his sexuality made him feel more dreamy than anyone else but that it inspired him to succeed.
He said: "I was a teenager and I was a teenager. I was a teenager and I was a teenager.
On the Radio 4 Desert Island Disc show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a father made him less concerned about the Olympic victory.
The long-running program's regular announcer, Kirsty Young, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
Daly, who was involved in Laverne's first program as a different person, said that he felt he had grown up less than others because he was socially unacceptable to boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, feeling inferior to others, feeling different, has given me the power and energy to succeed".
He said that he wanted to prove that he was a Yumki, so no one was disappointed when others finally learned about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, he is a high-profile member of the gay, bisexual and transgender community and a spokesperson for the LGBT community. He was used to call on other countries to decriminalize homosexuality at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year.
He said he was fortunate to be able to openly live and spoke openly to others to give them the same hope.
He describes his falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, a three-time world champion who met him in 2013 in a surprise with a man.
Daly, who was 20 years old when he married the oldest Oscar winner, says the age gap was never a problem.
He said that having experienced so many occasions at such a young age - he took part in his first Olympic Games on Monday at the age of 14 and his father died three years later - it was difficult to find a peer with the same achievements and defeats.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Black Dalley, and Dalley announced that the overall outlook was different.
"If you asked this last year, it was a gold medal", he said.
You know, there's a lot more to life than a gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer.
Father never believed he would die and one of his last requests was that if he got tickets to London in 2012, he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him you weren't gonna be in the front row long enough, Dad.
"I was holding his hand the moment he stopped breathing, and I knew I could beat him the moment I knew he had stopped breathing and died", he said.
The following year, in 2012, Daly won the Olympic bronze medal.
I knew that this was my whole life's dream - to dive in front of the people of my country at the Olympics, that feeling was no longer good", he said.
It was the basis for his first song selection - Heather Small's "Praud", but the feeling of being on the Olympic floor still lingers.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15pm British time.
Mickelson, who did not play well, will be suspended from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson, who will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup, will have to sit out the game to prevent it from becoming a moment of uncertainty.
Mickelson, who is entering his 12th season, was suspended from football and soccer by captain Jim Furwick on Saturday.
Instead of playing normally well in the United States, the five-time winner was out of the game, encouraging players to correct the cause of his pain.
The 48-year-old, who was not a top-class hitter at the height of his career, was not in the best shape for the tough National Golf competition.
If this path does not put him back so much, Michelsen will face British Open champion Francisco Molarinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
Mickelson's game will be crucial if the Americans are to give a warm start to a four-point deficit from 12 singles.
Furic trusted this man not because he had something else to do.
"He was fully aware of the task he had today, he knocked on my back and laid his hand on my trick and said he was preparing for tomorrow", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a very talented player, he's done a lot for the team in the past and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I was hoping for more, but this is what happened, and we thought this is what we should do.
He wanted to be there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldó's record for most Ryder Cups ever.
This may be his last chance to play on the Ryder Cup pitch, which has never matched his individual records.
Furich said that Mickelson's presence brought some sensation to the team, but he has won 18 and lost 20 and a half.
He's funny, he's ridiculous, he's fun to play with, and he's very valuable in the team room, he explained.
Young players enjoy being with him, and it's fun to watch.
He's got more to offer us than just the game.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between high scores is quickly closed.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between the points will be pushed to an unbeatable end throughout the race, until the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The Danishman played against the Americans in the 1997 tournament at Valdera, with Steve Ballestros as co-leader, with a five-point lead, and eventually won 141⁄2-131⁄2 with the lowest margin.
We had a big gap in the Waldera, and so did in Brooklyn, but we lost, and even if we won in the Waldera, it was a very small score, said Bjorn.
So history will show me and everyone in that group that this is not over.
You'll be fully operational tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This won't be over until you get your score on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try to win this medal, and the goal remains with it.
As Mavis said from the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but on the other side -- we know very well that they are the best players in the world".
The game was a great success, and the game was a great success. The game was a great success.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the day that individual talent will do something different.
It's nice to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're alone, you're fully tested for your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to the players to make the most of tomorrow.
Now let your partner come in your footsteps and he will do his best".
In the opposite team to Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furyk, hopes to play well on his own rather than as partners, and not with Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furic, a member of the Brooklyn winning team before losing as Europe eliminated the "Miracle of the Medina", played in both sides of those final rounds.
In 1999, when captain Ben Cran Shaw was asked how he had lined up his players to the final day, he replied, "I remember every word of it".
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to get to the same fast start as you saw in Brooklyn, the one you saw in Medina.
When the speed moves in one direction, it creates a lot of pressure for midfield racing.
We'll prepare our own for the race and we'll get the members into the race in a way that we feel is a race, and as you know, we'll try to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas was also given the task of taking the lead in the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the top race, and the other Europeans in the top half, respectively Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter.
"I went along with this group in this order because I thought it would cover everything", Bjorn said of her singles choices.
The new German warship has been postponed again.
Although the newest ship of the German Navy was to replace the old warships of the Cold War, it would have been put into service in 2014, local media reported that due to faulty systems and rising costs, it would not be deployed until at least next year.
The addition of the new Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, the main vessel of the Rhineland-Pulse, to duty has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman quoted by the Die Seite newspaper as saying.
The ship was to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues caused a major blow to the end of the forward navigation project.
Four Baden-Waterburg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will have powerful rifles, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as classified technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic suns.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - the newest ships must be able to stay away from the original ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays will be the most advanced warships, which will allow Germany to project power abroad, and will be outdated when they enter service, according to DieSite.
When the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Woss shipyard in Hamburg, the unfortunate F125 became a headline story last year.
This is the first time a ship has been returned by the Navy since its delivery.
Although little is known about the reason for the return, the German media cited a number of "grave software and hardware deficiencies" that could be useful if the warship were deployed in a military operation.
The Baden-Waterburg-class ships are controlled by 120 crewmembers, about half the crew power of the old Bremen-class ships, so software deficiencies are significant.
Also, the ship is surprisingly heavy, which reduces its performance while limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Falls are believed to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated that the total amount of the project has reached a record high of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of obtaining the latest ships are particularly important given the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, the head of the German parliament's Committee on Defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "going out of commission".
The official said the problem has grown over time as old ships have been removed from service but new ships have not been delivered.
He said with regret that no Baden-Waterburg-class ships would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust secretly listens to the secret life of the butterflies.
A new study on a Scottish mountain estate aims to reveal how whales use the landscape to search for food.
These findings will provide new insights into the behavior of the unique flying mammals and are expected to help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will look at the public and soprano pipistrels in Inverway Park in Westeros, as well as the brown long-eared Dobbinton fowl.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the bats throughout the season.
Mobile surveys will also be carried out by NHS staff and volunteers using hand-held detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the waves and what species they are doing.
A habitat map and a record are then presented to create a detailed landscape-sized image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas are the most important habitat for whales and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management tasks such as grassland design and forest maintenance for bats and other related species.
The population of whales across Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect the loss of resources and habitat.
The use of chemical treatments in fly-catching paper and building materials can be a threat to pets, but also to wind and lighting.
Squirrels are not blind.
However, their hunter-gatherer habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use advanced sound-determination technology to accurately detect lightning and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS takes the whales very seriously, with over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
There are ten trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, bird inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only segregated walleye reserve at the Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which has been home to eight of Scotland's ten walleye species.
The estate is their best place to live, says estate manager David Thompson.
"We have a lot of space for the swans in Treve", he said.
"We have old buildings, old trees, and good homes.
But there is still a lot that is not known about the falcons, so what we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to improve".
He stresses the importance of checking for butterflies before property maintenance, as the unintentional destruction of one mother pack could kill 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire local population.
Butterflies are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass, or interfere with them or destroy their prey.
Scottish officer in charge of the Whale Conservation Trust Elizabeth Farrell has been encouraged to help the public.
She said: "We have much to learn about our butterflies, and we do not know how their populations will grow for most of our species".
Lawyers are suing the German newspaper and Ronaldo denies corruption allegations.
Cristiano Ronaldo has cited allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying that people used his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
In 2009, a Portuguese and a French woman named Juan Carlos Forvad were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayoga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
A report in Der Spiegel on Friday said he was accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
A few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news" in a live video on Instagram, calling on his 142 million followers.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news", the Ballon d'Or winner told the camera five times.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's normal.
They want to be famous enough to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy and everything is going well", the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as "an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions".
Christian Shorts, a lawyer, said the player "will be liable for damages in a degree that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which could be the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a residential unit of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca returned to the player's room, where documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada indicted him for sexually assaulting her.
Mayorca said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and said he was "one percent" down, "99 percent" down, "a good man".
The documents state that the couple had sexual relations, but that Ronaldo confirmed it was in a standard way.
Mayorka claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was worried about "a sense of welcome" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said she was continually shocked by the alleged incident and is now seeking to overturn the settlement.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged scandal, and this summer moved to the Italian giants Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be 'perpetually worried' about losing carmakers
UK Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark said that if the UK lost its position as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, it would "regret forever".
He also noted that the British had told the BBC that Toyota would temporarily suspend production at its plant in Bernaston near Derby if the UK left the EU without a deal, which "must be taken into account".
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit would increase job costs.
The Bernstein plant, which produces Toyota's Oris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I think we will see production at our factory stop if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March", said Mervin Cook, managing director of Bernaston, Toyota.
Other UK automakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade is conducted.
BMW, for example, says it will close its factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The key to what carmakers say is the supply chain risk in a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "time-by-time" basis, receiving parts from suppliers in both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for cars that are placed on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the industry says, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and stock shortages.
Toyota will not be able to hold stocks of more than a day's worth at the Derbyshire plant, which will stop production, the company says.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan to build a chain for future relations with the EU was "exclusively designed to stop the bricks at the border".
"We need a deal. I say we want to make the best deal that will not only allow us to enjoy the success now but also allow us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota as well as other manufacturers is that we must definitely be able to sustain what has been a very successful supply chain".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but warns that additional costs will reduce factory competition and ultimately increase labor costs.
Peter Tsovallaris, a recruiter for the United Trade Union Workers' Union in Bernstein for 24 years, said that the worries among his members are increasing: "In my experience, these jobs will never be recovered once they are lost.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says the meeting between Rosenstein and Trump could be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that the crucial meeting of Donald Trump's meeting with Vice Attorney General Rodrossenstein was "one more week behind", as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, Trump supporters' ties to Russia and the president's ability to interfere with justice.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and threatens Mueller's independence has been a source of Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a rope to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York City on Thursday was announced.
Trump said he "didn't want to turn down Rosenstein", but the meeting was postponed to prevent a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Dr. Kavanaugh and a woman who later accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, with a full Senate vote delayed further, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no date set for it, it may be this week, and I saw another week of delay for everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I always like to keep the media informed".
Some reporters object to the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was due to her dislike of television reporters for "great appeal", adding: "I disagree with their rise to prominence".
She then suggested that there would be more direct meetings between Trump and the press.
"The president conducts more questions and answers than any president before him", she noted, not citing evidence, adding: "We have counted them".
The press conference is ongoing, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it pretty much, and you've seen us do it many times over the past few weeks, and it's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends openings or press conferences with potential guests.
Single press conferences are rarely held.
The president will explain why freelancing and sometimes ridiculous behavior is so common in front of reporters gathered in New York City this week.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the NHS in Scotland about the Brexit scare.
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to remain there after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter saying the UK has less than six months to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its assigned public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman stated: "In the summer, talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU continued, and the desired decisions are being made this autumn.
But the UK government is also accelerating its preparations for a no-deal situation.
I know this is definitely a very uncomfortable time for you all.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve healthcare functions, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home, and we desperately need you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
After a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury, according to Mike Ogan of Tennessee.
The accident occurred shortly before the end of the half, Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters.
"He came across the line and there was some sort of fall", Reed said.
Before he was admitted to the hospital for further analysis, coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie aside and gave him oxygen.
An officer with the Tennessee State Team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the surgery at Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris said "there is still no information on the type/size of the injury", and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine the circumstances of the injury.
Redshirt amateur Abercrombie is making his first start with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five touchdowns on Saturday before leaving the race, bringing his total to 18 during the season.
Foreign buyers are charged a high stamp fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged a high stamp fee when buying property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This action will neutralize Coffin's mission to attract young voters.
The United Kingdom will raise stamp duty on non-payers of taxes.
The Treasury expects to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a high stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK, and that the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The process will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Cobine's effort to target young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and target higher-income people.
The increase in stamp duties will be levied on tax-exempt individuals and entities in the UK, and the additional amount will encourage government action to combat insomnia.
The surcharge, in addition to the current stamp duty, is likely to be about three percent higher than the higher levels introduced for second homes and rentals two years ago.
The Treasury expects the scheme to generate 120 million pounds a year.
The rise in prices of newly built London properties has made it more difficult for first-time buyers to set foot in the home market, with 13 percent of them being bought by non-UK residents.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas - especially in the capital - have become "hot cities" because more foreign buyers are often driven out of the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp cut to allow the youth community to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of plundering land and keeping property prices high without using them, and he urged the lady to abandon quotas for affordable housing to tackle "housing scandal" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of housing reforms including the elimination of rent control and "no-holds-barred" evictions.
He also wants to give more authority to the churches to build new homes.
She said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
It means stabilizing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be a good idea for non-UK residents and hardworking British citizens as well as companies with foreign sources to buy homes easily.
Many people have long dreamed of owning a home, and the slumber of a hard sleep is becoming a reality".
Jack Cross: "My only hope is to manage Scotland".
Sunderland's leader Jack Cross said his "unique hope" was to become Scotland's manager to some extent.
Scott, 42, is currently facing the challenge of reviving the Northeast, the third-ranked team in League One.
St Mirren moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after the team was promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap for that", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I visited the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always drew me back.
I will only have that opportunity if I succeed in social management".
Ross' predecessors as manager at Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allard, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.
The former head of Alloa Athletics said he had no fear of leading a reputation in such a well-established club as previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm going to measure my success right now by saying, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?
"The club is a very good team and it is very good at the Premier League.
"It is not an easy task to get there, but I can only see success if I can bring the community back there".
After a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hart, Ross has spent only three years as manager.
He later helped Alloa return from relegation to the third tier, turning the St Mirren team from near-relegation to championship winners the following season.
Ross says he's now more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falklands, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
He recalled that the inauguration of Aloha was "a real milestone".
"I honestly believed that management was more worthy of me than playing.
It seems amazing because I did the right thing, and I got a fair life path out of it, and I enjoyed a fair amount of rewards.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things you have to accomplish every week.
I still do it when there's workplace stress and pressure, but management feels like it's the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and it feels the most comfortable I've ever experienced in my entire adult life".

A survey has revealed that the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat waves draw more people to busy pubs in Britain but put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales in pubs and restaurants rose 2.7 percent in July, but sales in restaurants fell 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA who compiles statistics, said: "The continued sunshine and the delay in England's World Cup qualification meant that sales in pubs rose 2.8 percent in July, following a pattern similar to the previous month of June, and restaurants were hit harder than ever.
In June, the restaurant trade fell 1.8 percent to its worst in July.
The sale of alcohol in restaurants and pubs is more active than ever, as the retail volume of the restaurant has fallen.
Even though the restaurants were not as well-run as the restaurants that were serving food, they were also exposed to the sun.
It seems people are going out for a drink.
Sales of managed restaurants and pubs increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
The main factors in sales in the out-of-home market are the impact of weather and major social or sporting events.
With the current cost pressures, particularly the year-on-year decline in sales of 4.8 percent, becoming particularly pressing, it is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle.
The long hot summer will not be the worst time for the food business, and the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the space we need".
The overall sales growth of restaurants and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand exposure.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK restaurant, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data for 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has a secret social media account hidden from their parents
A survey revealed that one in five children - some under the age of 11 - has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake" Instagram pages.
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - creates social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that there was a rapid increase in "fake" Instagram accounts in addition to Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a satisfying "main" account to show their parents, while maintaining personal ones.
13 A mother who accidentally went to her daughter's secret website saw a young man begging others to "rape me".
A survey by the UK's Federation of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Digital Awareness and Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and more than half of them tend to hold personal accounts.
"It is a sad situation that many young people are being led to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them", said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Elide D'Oyly will become the "voice of the Scottish Athletic Association"
Elide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Council.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated youth and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Battie described it as a perfect opportunity for the sport's leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elid is highly regarded by the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we strongly believe that bringing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics", said Battie.
"I am interested in acting as a voice for the players", said Doly, "and I believe I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is now a regular BBC commentator and has been unable to walk due to a chickenpox.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, on a day like today, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell whether or not I would recover.
It was a very tiring task, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and am practicing agility today!
Thank you for sending me encouraging messages!"
A breast pump company has emerged online with ads comparing mothers and cows.
A breast pump company has distributed online advice with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows.
In a commercial to mark the launch of what has been dubbed the "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV released a promotional video with an offensive music video showing the freedom that the new pump offers to mothers.
True mothers dance from a grain barn full of foxes with four cows to a song that contains the following words: "Yes, I drink milk, but you can't see a tail" and "If you didn't know these weren't turkeys, they are my breasts".
The crowd continues to sing: "Pump, pump, I give them to the children, pump, pump, I'll get rid of my women".
However, the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
The video received mixed reviews from viewers with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, with many saying it undermines the "expansion" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor decision.
"Their children are not to be robbed of them within days of their birth, but they must be conceived and delivered for milk production, just as we are", wrote one.
The LV breast pump fits right into the breast pad.
Another commented: "Obviously, both mother and child are disgusted.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who should keep their babies with them?"
"It's such a silly ad", said another.
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman said she found the song "awkward".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'm still breastfeeding, I'll have one.
I felt like a cow when I pumped it.
Advertising sounds a little crazy, but I understand what it means.
This is a smart product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who are breastfeeding (often in their workplaces or toilets) and thinking of themselves as 'two'.
This is not a commercial that criticizes or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women's team shows them all dancing with this clever pump in their lap.
The idea behind this ad is that most breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, the LV pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and fits seamlessly into a breastfeeding cradle, allowing women to move around, hold their babies and move around while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD, Anna Ballarin, commented: "The LV pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and socially inspiring introduction.
By announcing a parallel line between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the unique sense of freedom that the new pump will provide, in a fun and detailed way, to bring to the attention of breastfeeding and all the challenges it entails.
This isn't the first time that an LV pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother-in-law used this product to model for designer Martha Jakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly transported to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children who have been held in relative unchanged monthly border crossing has increased rapidly as a result of the harsh language and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants, fearing that submitting to have a child will threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other senior members of their household would be required to submit fingerprints and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanz, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that dozens of people who applied to sponsor orphaned minors had been arrested by the agency.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the members of the sponsors or sponsors' homes are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminals and expatriates.
So we will continue to track them", Mr. Albanes said.
In an effort to organize children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to the detention facility staff, require some of them to be detained for 60 days after the previous standard was adopted and appear in court within a month.
Many people will appear in a videoconference call to an immigration judge to ask for legal status for their case, not in person.
Those considered unworthy of relief will be immediately deported.
According to detention facility workers and reports published in the last few months, the longer the detention of children, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent riots or escape attempts.
The consultants said the problems were exacerbated in a larger area such as Tornillo where the size of the child may not be noticeable.
They said that the shock that many already experience could be compounded by taking children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends.
Syria says the US, France and Turkey should withdraw their "stayed troops" immediately
The war in Syria is now in its eighth year, but Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam has also called on Syrian refugees to visit their homelands, urging the UN General Assembly.
Foreign troops have been illegally staying on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism, said Maoulam, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, "and will continue to work for that".
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally", he told the General Assembly.
Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced, Maullam stressed, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said the Damascus state will continue this sacred battle until terrorists and "illegal overseas stays" of both terrorist groups are "removed from all Syrian territory".
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arabs against the Kurdish military and President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
Maulaam claimed that the situation was good enough for them to return to the refugee issue, blaming "some Western countries" for "unreasonable fear" that led refugees to flee.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these benefits", he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that reform aid to Syria will not be provided until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN ambassador said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the former main rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a massive Russian-backed Syrian military attack on the three million-strong province.
However, Maulaam stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline", and expressed confidence that the military action would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, "who will be routed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Reiterating that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitutional documents", Maulaam set conditions for the committee's participants on behalf of the Syrian government and warned against interference.
Why would Trump win a second time?
Unless his presidency is terminated in time by criticism and disgrace, as many liberals expect, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020.
It will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs that the visitors are tired.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News's average prime time audience has averaged from 1.7 million to 2.4 million four years ago, while NBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has a massive top cable rating of 3.5 million viewers per headline night.
"This is a fire that is drawing people because it is not something we understand", said Neil Bayer, host of ABC's drama "Designated Savior", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the House.
Another theory is that of the grateful comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Snicking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Ms. Schuell told me.
Confusion has a recreational value.
In fact, unlike anything else on television, news from Washington could determine whether immigrant families could be reunited and Roy V. Wade's future in global economy, among other things.
Surfing is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
Also, the use of "deep background" by Bob Woodward as a source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Oystrich-Sum Bomb jacket ("a teasing suit", the Washington Post said) and the use of Stomi Daniel's terrorist account of Trump's speech by an expert pocketbook that has been debating for six hours, lead you to a situation where you are a common-sense Hebrew man who has been waiting for you.
As one, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does feels like a reality show and every night he gives you something out of it", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Willhouse Entertainment and creator of "Boun Star" about Trump's display of cyclical actors' blueprints and unexpected popularity (commending Kim Jong-un and starting a conflict with the NFL).

The toughest midterm election is a cash flow.
It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania has seen a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of two leaders of the same nation for the same seat.
Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring, was recently removed from office.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which is heavily overstated with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally designed to benefit Republicans.
The new 17th contest has been a campaign finance fingerprinting between the main party's Finance Force, the Democratic Business Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Advertising Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a highly publicized victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats have been pushed to the brink by political pundits.
The amount of sanctions imposed on El Salvador for supporting China is reinstated.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with a slight backlash with Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm conversation with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ran a hotel in Panama until the partners removed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that officials had decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore".
But El Salvador was only fined an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will have a major impact on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
In an internal meeting, a similar meeting, which appeared to be a step forward in efforts to prevent incoming migrants, saw officials in North America and Central America postpone a high-level summit aimed at security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials explained that they needed to effectively end no considerations of fines for El Salvador and move the conference forward.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to address a summit in mid-October as a sign of the announcement of administrative locations for the meeting.
Meanwhile, three U.S. ambassadors from Washington quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harshness or sanctions.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, and agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
An external analyst close to the administration confirmed their accounts and spoke about the anonymity condition.
The Bible is a book of history.
The report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice may be the next shot, and so far there is considerable evidence of that in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign was cooperating with Russia in the attack on our election.
If the Congress is transferred, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for the organization, just as he is preparing to return to the front of the electorate and to a jury of his peers.
There are a number of them, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
Only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich, in 1938 German officials were preparing to launch a plot against Hitler.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid years of murder.
The path of history is to go around such specific points that the inevitable progress of democracy will be either rapid or slow.
Americans now face a number of these challenges.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rodrosenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the report in this letter that he proposed secretly recording the president's conversations and deemed him unfit for office last year, Rosenstein has been in a dangerous position.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is fake.
"If the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony - how will we respond?
And most of all, should we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable in the medium term?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in a state of disarray for a long time.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna conflict.
Following an impressive win against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in recognition of their victory over the Austrians, which will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League's G-League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes this could be used as a stepping stone for Rangers to move to higher-level things.
"It was a good thing for us because Vilal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing we could get something and came back with something.
Perhaps we could have achieved it in the end, but overall, the lack of victory was a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
By Thursday it will be another great European night.
Hopefully, we can score three points, but it will be a tough game because they have done well in their final, but, with the team behind us, I'm confident we can move forward and get a good result.
Everything that happened with my wound and the changes that happened in society was definitely a tough one, but now there's a factor that makes it feel good.
The team is good, and the players in the team really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, after the last race, we can move forward and succeed".
Women are not sleeping because of this fear of retirement savings.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few had discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't negotiate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance business at Nationwide.
We should start here.
If you do not have a prior consent, your family will not be able to provide care.
Since the choice can be a significant factor in determining the cost, work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to propose a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance policy with a hybrid monetary value that helps cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Keep a healthcare background so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider setting up a power of attorney for your money.
A trusted person will be chosen to make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to afford them.

A man was shot several times with a gas rifle at the Ilfracombe.
A man was shot several times with a rifle while walking home at night.
The 40-year-old, from Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The shooting, which occurred around 02:30 local time, was described by officials as "a deliberate act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday killed about 384 people and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication failure has prevented rescue workers from receiving any information from the Donggala region, north of Palau City, near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palo Alto, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some highlights about Palau and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The townspeople were celebrating their 40th anniversary at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a region stretching for over 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The region, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of economy in Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Paluu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Donggala and killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific earthquake hazard zone and is constantly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake and tsunami struck 14 countries on the west coast of the province of Aceh, East Sumatra, Indonesia, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them inhabitants of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree tsunami hits the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands just off Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be destroyed and about 300 people killed by a 10-meter-high tsunami.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya peninsula in Aceh, causing devastation and reminding people of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami disaster.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the collapse of the buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Over 500 people died in a major earthquake in Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, most of which occurred in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Trac Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Horsemen, a 29-year-old Palin suspect in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, a woman known to report crimes was taken away from her phone when she tried to call the police.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su pre-trial compound and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked about the facts, the network reported.
Pauline has faced three class-action misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also sentenced to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine for a Class B felony.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Putin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Supreme Court.
He was indicted in January 2016 on charges of domestic assault, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend was accused of hitting him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by grassroots groups for linking her son's violent behavior to a PTSD situation resulting from serving in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have been killed in a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The tsunami, which was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the moment of the impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palo Alto for a celebration when the tsunami hit.
Federal prosecutors are calling for a rare death sentence for the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty, a rare state sentence not given since 1953 for a federal crime, to be handed out to Sypholo Saipow, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people.
Saypov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to subdue pedestrians and cyclists on the road to attack a bike lane on the West Side of Lower Manhattan Highway in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Sipov killed eight "at least" victims and "at least" serious bodily injuries, in an intent to call for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court records, both counts are capable of carrying out the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 charges, including eight counts of practically homicide commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime trials and the violent and destructive use of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", and Cypow described the way it was carried out as "compulsive, cruel and disgraceful".
"By Zifulo Habibullevic Zapoov, Diego Enrique Angeline, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Arledge, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnuco, the family and friends were harmed and damaged", the intent was stated in the announcement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last death sentence was handed down in a trial in the Southern District of New York.
Prosecutor Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence was given in a federal trial in New York in 1953 to a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Sipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators what he did was right.
According to the indictment, Saipow told the authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
Federal Public Defender David Patton, representing Cypow, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than admitting a guilty plea to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole will cause a long-term shock to all those involved in this incident", Patten said.
Zapoev's security team had earlier urged the defendants not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentary MP Tori says the Brexit negotiations should be handed over to Nigel Farage
Nigel Farage threatened to "lead the People's Army forward" during a protest at the Tory Summit.
The former leader of Iran has said politicians should feel the "warmth" of the Eurosceptics - and a member of parliament from Theresa May has suggested that he should be in charge of the EU's negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have 'left' if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Rexman Tory has stressed the challenge she faces in reaching a long-standing agreement on her split positions by joining a separate protest against Brexit City.
Amid Brexit, survivors and attacks by the EU, the Prime Minister is trying to maintain her agenda.
Despite the setback, allies insisted that she would move forward with a deal with Brussels and force the anti-EU and Labour Party to choose her package and 'non-cooperative status'.
Speaking at the Live Means Live rally in Solihull, Mr. Bone said he wanted to 'cut bricks'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a person of integrity and given the responsibility of negotiating with the city of Brussels.
"If he had been the custodian, we would have already left", he said.
The Welinborough MP also said: 'I am for Brexit but we must cut the bricks.'
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight for surrender in world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Yojana Bon denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people want to change their minds and stay is completely false.'
Tory's Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the march, addressing reporters: 'What I am saying is simple: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The brick-and-mortar campaign is not popular with the general public, and the opposition does not expect to vote for it, in fact it is not popular with our party and our activists who have taken us down the streets and elected us first.
Please stop and start listening.'
In a letter to the lady, she stated: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs by keeping their promises".
Mr Farage said at the rally that if politicians are ready to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be prepared to "feel the heat".
"It is now a matter of building trust between us - the people and our political class", he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to warm up to our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We are leading the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never give up until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those who preferred to stay traveled through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists protested against the Brexit banners.
Labour's contemporary Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced in a party statement at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that unhindered IT systems can be implemented for border-free trade in Ireland and all the technology for Canada, etc"., he said.
It's a complete joke.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he said.
Warren plans to focus on running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the Legislature said she was "very focused on running for president" after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, reports the Boston Globe.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will face Jeff Deal of the Republic of the GOP, who was Trump's co-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign, for re-election in November.
She has been working on a speculative mediation that she will run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Hollywood was her 36th meeting using the city council level since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded by saying that "it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that it involves a woman in a top position".
Simsj was arrested for shooting and killing in LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced in a news conference that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying the person in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the University of the South.
According to 247Sports, "Wedid Sims eventually died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday.
Wade was shot by Simpson while trying to protect his friend.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being involved in the incident and shooting Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and turned over to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after ordering teams to award the victory to Sebastian Vettel
It was clear that since Valterie Botas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, Mercedes will play a big role in the team order race.
From the end, Botas got off to a good start, defending his place in the first two seasons without allowing Hamilton to score any points and inviting Wettell to launch an attack on his team's player.
Wettle first acted effectively and decisively, prompting Hamilton to run the team behind.
Mercedes then came a round after Wettle, but Hamilton went on after a fierce race, and saw this as the Ferrari driver left the risk of two passes to defend third place, despite reluctance inside.
Max Worstappen started from the back row of the system and finished seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then stayed in the race to get a quick finish and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place, leading a large part of the race.
He eventually reached the middle of the race in round 44, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps, causing Rykonan to drop to fourth place.
It was a tough day, and Valterie did a great job over the weekend and told me to let her pass me by as a real gentleman.
The team has done such an extraordinary job to get a second", Hamilton said.
It's a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over the failure to read a letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly cite Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed people were "low and evil and false".
"One of the most beautiful things that can happen in the last few days in the Senate is that when you see anger, you see people who are angry and humble and evil and lying", he said.
"When you look at the exits and exits, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get it out?
Remember her answer... did you drop the papers... "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leave".
Well, wait a minute.
"We're not out", he continued, "in the style of a senator".
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein describing the charges against Kavanaugh, which he denied had left her office in early September - but had left her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not broadcast her speech", Feinstein reportedly told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
But her refusal was not well suited to the president who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
She may not be, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual discrimination by three women, the President said Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are about to take back power in any way necessary.
You see the humiliation, the disgust, who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control", the president's statement was reported by MediaWide.
Dundee Stars lose 5-3 to the Belfast Giants.
Pantheon scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Winning the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday, the Dundee Stars won the Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The kicks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouillier led the Giants to a two-goal opening margin.
Dwyer led Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cavie to the top of the hostel before the Giants recovered the gap.
Lucas Lundwald Nelson defended his victory by two goals before Francois Bouchard defeated Dundee.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players who came on to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the tournament, and the Giants won all three previous games.
With the help of Kendall McFall, Boulier doubled the gap four minutes earlier and entered the field with starting quarterback David Rutherford in the fourth minute.
During a busy opening period, Sullivan re-routed the game to the hosts at 13:10 before Matt McWord became Cooney's host at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead of the first break when they scored their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts were back together and Butchard pulled it down again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran together helped Nelson lead the Dundee team for the first time in the second half and he secured the win with his team's fifth half in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will be competing in the next game on Friday at home to the Milton Keynes.
Hundreds of people on board the plane are killed by the air traffic controller to ensure they survive the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller who died while on a flight to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had safely left the ground is considered a hero.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a result of a tsunami caused by a massive earthquake on Sulawesi island on Friday.
The area continues to be hit by the aftermath of severe earthquakes, with many trapped in the rubble of Palau City.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Govan Agung refused to quit his job at the busy control tower at Palu Airport, Muteira Sis Al-Jufri.
He was waiting to confirm that the Battic Air Flight 6321 was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped from it, thinking the control tower was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
According to Australian news agency ABC News, the decision could save hundreds of lives, said Indonesian air operations spokesman Johannes Sireit.
We prepared a helicopter from Kalimantan, Balikappan to transport him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pallu.
"We were heartbroken to learn about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands due to the country's disaster mitigation agency, which says access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"Many bodies are still in the rubble and many have not been reached, so it is believed that the number will continue to rise", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Ngroho.
Waves rising to a height of six metres have destroyed the city, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
"The small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help survivors, but we don't know what the outcome will be.
This is already a tragedy, but it can only get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the army: "I urge you to work day and night to complete every task related to the decoration.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, the earthquake in Lombok killed more than 550 people in Indonesia.
Micronesian Airlines: One person has been reported missing in a plane crash in the region, according to the New Guinea Airlines.
The airline, which operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, previously said 47 passengers and crew were safely rescued when the plane was sinking, but now says one is missing.
Air Nugini issued a statement saying that it was not responsible for any male passengers as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline, in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, is trying to locate the man, it said.
The airline did not respond promptly to requests for more information, such as the age or nationality of the passenger.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
As of Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized, and all were in good condition, the airline said.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the runway near the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to hit the runway.
The plane came from a very low altitude, said American airline passenger Bill Jans.
"It's a very good thing", said Jens.
The ship was sunk by a torpedo, and the crew was able to reach the emergency gate.
He said the flight attendants were terrified and were shouting and had minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve steam also helped bring people to shore using a wind-filled boat before the ship sank 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered plane crashes in the past two decades, but nothing has happened to Air Nugini.
An analyst has a nightly timeline of women who have been wiped out alive.
In 2014, a complaint was filed in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to merge the traveling parts of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Leger reported that Roulette said he received location data from several cell phones that showed she was with Teles Chambers on the evening of her death.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to call.
Sanford arrived at a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the complaint party whether Telis's claims that he was in Sanford's truck that night were true, Sanford said: "My truck was in Nashville, so he is telling a lie".
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Shortly after Chambers' death, Teles said that she may have deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The final hearing of the trial is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped to refer the trial to the jury later that day.
What is conscious hip hop?
It takes three sets of hip hop to fill their music with positive messages and challenge the genre's negative outlook.
The Bristol-based group High Breed says hip hop is dealing with social issues outside of its political message source.
They want to go back to its roots and popularize conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Acala and Locky.
Another black man?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for deportation after a "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for being discriminated against after receiving a text message from their mother that they were "still black".
The couple denied being racist and likened the case to "forced money laundering".
Twins mother, Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, new childcare provider, Giselle Morris, was shocked when she found out she was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"No more black man, Papa Papa Papa", Mrs. Plazko-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman, "disappointed" by her late mistake, fired Ms. Morris, saying that she had done a bad job of taking care of the out-of-work children of an African-American and that she hoped to be a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for her one-day work and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal and asking for compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I know it's discriminatory", she told Post on Pride, "and I want to show them that it's not something they should do".
The couple responded to accusations of being racist, fearing that they could no longer trust her after her conviction and saying that it was the right thing to do to fire Morris.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", the owner, Joel Plazko, told The Post.
"But even if you do wrong, would you like to leave your children in the hands of someone to whom you have responded harshly?
Your newborn daughter?
Look at this".
Describing the case as a "money theft", Placebo said his wife had not been working for about two months after giving birth and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Will you follow someone like that?
It's not a very good thing to do", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still pending, and the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, accusing them of their behavior and reasoning.
The new article reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not consider a talking bear
The book was published in the United States in the early 1990's and is now available in many countries. The book was published in the United States in the United States in the early 1990's.
It's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's immense success".
Her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, said he may have regretted the rejection of his work, calling the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year "one with mystery".
Referring to Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of our family", she said her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He is a rather quiet man, and he is not even a proud man", she said.
"But because Paddington was so special to him, it's almost like having a kid who can accomplish something: you're proud of them even if it's not something you actually did.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Whatever his design and imagination, he was always used to paying homage to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was admitted to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life, although not effectively.
"Nad regularly called on the phone saying that it was really bad and that she could not be expected to recover", said Ms. Ednan-Laperoz.
"Then I received a call from Nad that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And then I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll come to you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to operate her heart were slowly coming out of her system.
She died a short time ago, and this was the closing of it all.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going to open.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to deal with it".
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, who was grieving the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane with the other passengers, aware of the seriousness of her condition.
"No one knew", she said.
"I kept my head down, and tears came out of my eyes all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sadness about Nad on the flight.
It's that he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
The mourners postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have posted messages of comfort and phone numbers on a bridge in Wales where people can ask for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to suffer the way I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said that her son was a man who always smiled and aspired to become a chef.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room".
However, he was "in a really dark place", and he stopped working before he died.
In 2014, Taylor's then 11-year-old brother committed suicide in search of his brother.
"I am constantly worried about this fate", said Mrs. Davis. "I am constantly worried about this fate".
Ms. Davis created cards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to about even a friend.
"You must speak, and you must not be silent".
Mrs. Davis's friend for many years, Mrs. Humphries, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling a mental breakdown or depression or anything", she said.
"We saw a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
He was at the bottom of the Christmas tree - he didn't look at their faces or do anything else when the kids opened their presents".
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but they wanted to cope: "It caused a family dispute.
It'll turn us in two directions.
But we all want to keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in balance when the FBI begins the investigation.
"I thought, if we could get something like what he actually asked for - a limited, limited-time, limited scope investigation - we could get a small or consensus", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, noting that he feared the committee would "crash" during a strong pro-democracy standoff.
Why didn't the FBI want to investigate Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters?
Their reluctance was almost entirely due to time.
There are only five weeks left until midterm elections on November 6 - and if Republicans do as badly as expected, their efforts to elect the person they want to be on the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has received phone calls to tell Senators in the House to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who met his wife, Ashley, who served in the White House and was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
Elections will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to be elected to the Supreme Court by a landslide.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is "falling".
A South Korean legislator has said that since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Integration, Park Byung-seong said that 1,127 displacements occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main reasons for this were strict border controls and high tariffs imposed by human traffickers between North Korea and China.
The Pyongyang government has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Koreans will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul's government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats the culprits as refugees, not illegal immigrants, and often forcibly returns them.
In recent months, the relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have grown significantly.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang earlier this month for talks that were based on the suspension of nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the historic meeting of President Jun in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed to comprehensive rules for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But since then, Korean Foreign Minister Ryong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without any confidence in the United States, our national security cannot be trusted, and in such circumstances, we have no unilateral disarmament in the first place", said Mr. Lee in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, "crazy" and said he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelozzi made the comments during an interview with the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't control it, but imagine if a woman ever behaved like that, they wouldn't call her 'helpful,'" Pelosi said on Thursday, referring to her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he was close to screaming and holding his breath, even discussing his family and his high school days.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "horrible and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he showed partiality against Democrats.
"I think he's made himself unfit by those statements and the way he chased Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if Kavanaugh would be convicted and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi cast doubt on whether he would try to impeach him.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, I say he's not only worthy of being on the Supreme Court, but also of being on the court he is on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Tourist Appeal Court.
Since he was considered a neutral judge, Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was also concerned about Kavanaugh's affordable hosting bill or the possibility of a verdict against Roy v. Wade.
During his probationary trial, Kavanaugh missed questions about whether he would defeat certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the time for a crazy, biased person to go to court and expect us to read 'Isn't that good,'" Pelozzi said.
And women should control it.
It's a good criticism that has been raging for months and years, and she can't get it without mourning.
"We cry only when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "A woman who was a CEO somewhere and helped me a lot told me that she cried when she got angry, but when she got angry and cried, you could think that I cried for grief to the person she was talking to".
I'm angry with you".
Then she moved on.
And I thought it was great".
Because they are basically misidentified, tears have been given space as a way to express anger.
I have a vivid memory of my previous job, when I was working in a manly office, crying in my anger and in my words in my words, and I was always afraid to pull a rich woman, a fraud manager, by my neck and up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will be happy to make you feel sad".
Patricia Schoder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a single affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Mrs. Schoder, who was further disappointed, realized that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a smile after 30 years.
"Seven other candidates were already running and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was still delayed, and she was delayed in raising funds, so she vowed not to enter the contest unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave 1,000 dollars to men, would only give her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was appalled by emotions - expressing gratitude to the people who supported her, raising money and targeting voters rather than delegates - that made it difficult for her to breathe - like anger at sex.
"You may have thought I was shocked", Mrs. Schroeder recalled, "and the media responded to her.
"You may think that the Clinics are my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my grave?"
"She was crying?"
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The early Olverson voices of the US-China trade war were deafening, and experts say a dispute between the countries far from the end of the war could benefit Beijing's rule in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year about imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant shift with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which are taxed at half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
This has been a constant threat to Beijing, and recently, the US has imposed a tax rate of five to 10 percent on 60 million dollars of goods.
China has also promised to hit the United States and the world's second-largest economy is not ready to leave anytime soon.
Washington's retreat means meeting demands, but publicly bowing to the United States is a shame for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could help China to reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies in the long run.
"It is actually more dangerous than previously realized by those who expect a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing to create conditions that could trigger an economic collapse in both countries", said Abigail Grace, research assistant at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank focused on Asia.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'olam said the situation in the country was improving.
"Thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the country is more stable and secure today", he said.
The government is continuing to carry out reconstruction work to restore areas devastated by terrorists.
The refugees who have been forced to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods now have all the conditions to return to their country voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'oulam said the Syrian regime appreciated the support for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe confirms its victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Björn's team regained the European title after reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The most successful US star of the tournament, Phil Mickelson, pulled his first hit to the Par-3 16th hole, handing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinarri has excelled in all of his tournament rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The European team's lowest ranked player was Thorbjørn Olsen of Denmark, who defeated the American Jordan Spit 5 and 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Polter of England, who is believed to have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Ryder Cup eight-time champion Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you so much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very, very happy to be able to reclaim the trophy.
It's a team effort, and I'm happy to be able to help it", said Garcia, who was inspired by the European victory.
He handed the fire to his compatriot John Ram, who eliminated Tiger Woods, a golf legend from the singles tournament on Sunday, 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and currently holds a professional Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Jack Nicklaus, the only runner-up to win 14 major titles, is a strange figure from one of the greatest players of his time.
The United States has been struggling to find ships every weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Feno, who have played golf with high-profile championships throughout the tournament.
U.S. President Jim Furyk said after a disappointing campaign in his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment of some kind of engagement in Europe.
We lost.
Our greetings to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
Let's get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and let's move on.
I am a fan of the 12 and proud to be the leader.
You should say hello.
"We were outnumbered".
