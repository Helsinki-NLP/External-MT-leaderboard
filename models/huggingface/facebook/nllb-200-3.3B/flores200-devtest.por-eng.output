Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but it also offers details not so often found in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as racks, lack a well-developed stem but have other features, such as tassels and barbels. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rack was possibly the result of an evolutionary development after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather to display or regulate temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a pup.
The researchers suggested that although the tail was from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not a plume.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said that 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect the perpetrator of the attack was an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant.
They discovered that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define a star's Rossby number, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy's environment is located in the environment of a galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of various tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate", in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, and at least two were health care professionals.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caverns on planet Earth, which tend to maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters lock themselves in a voting booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedures in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss and recovered their mobile phone and laptop".
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, said Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the proceedings, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were under close supervision of the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly yesterday promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime.
The occasional violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI revealed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 0719 local time, which was Friday at 2119 GMT.
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said there were no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an old lady who had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was ... or maybe even more so ... I loved her and I'll miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to change in Australia, to make it a republic, grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome the pain, as these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number until January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense"
There's speculation that he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and offer more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, parking and public transport connections will be unavailable.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the match would have to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the supporter.
On Thursday, Science magazine published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza forte, and the migratory finch cactus, Geospiza contrisiros.
Gold can be worked into any shape, even rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a fine thread, twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
Because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat much larger, smaller animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three adult males of the same family, together with up to 30 females and pups.
Women are usually closely related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and wild goats. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and snarling words.
The jaguar likes to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that the jaguar hunts are much smaller than the jaguar.
Scientists believe jaguars track and find their prey by scent, sniffing where they have been through the soil.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and they can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in a different environment from that in which they previously lived.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants, and most of the food we eat is plant food, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would be no match for it.
While most of their meals were familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed holding banquets together where they lay on their sides while they made their meals.
The diet of ancient Rome did not include foods originating in America and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of their respective gods.
People were offering sacrifices to the gods, and the priests were trying to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street, and stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, found Greenland and named it that.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie The Legend of Lost Treasure, you may find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large, meaningful group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization requires the passing on of knowledge across different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a just dissemination.
Minor cultures often fade without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to exact taxes, and because of the lack of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were generally uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal the tax and tariff laws between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful national team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the island group that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago".
The founding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region christened the place as Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the size of film that was most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the smallest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The rather abused and often demoralized law of thirds is a rather simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by its influential force, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and was provided for in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral-flagged vessels.
Germany, seeing that there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of warfare during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war raged between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, post-Revolutionary, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, making it possible for the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of the patents being based on class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists, because once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The "upward-pointing bow" mark has its V-like appearance, and the "downward-pointing bow mark" has its V-like appearance with a staple or a square without the underside.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but do not forget that the printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the technology offer or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; second, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone may say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning an automobile.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and, over time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that were eventually mandatory.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Capital of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture undertaken to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families only.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by the parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child has been due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of his severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered severe trauma or abuse in childhood, before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking Microsoft Office clip.
Virtual scaffolds are internalised in software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a myriad of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care and educate, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
The foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are indicated as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
personal involvement and relationships with continuity were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied about audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, nevertheless, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the cluster of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system, consuming available plant resources, to meet its requirements for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to act accordingly leads to serious consequences - severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant-based resources with the greatest accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
However, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" much as modern-day savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is a process that consists of waking up deliberately during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a semi-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at all.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces the person to stand up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely correlated with his level of physical and spiritual stress.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing that gets in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they have been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. After the war, the clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and in fact there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of its enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Battle of World War II, when the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval organization, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted of only parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more rugged roads.
Dormers were implemented early on to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "erect man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want to have not just a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and put an end to them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have been made greater by man's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a printing plant owned by John Dunlap.
During the night, about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap attacks are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-made copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
That term comes from our long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are structured enough to cling to human beings.
Both beetles and cockroaches are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in their hosts' nests or shelters.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests, or in their child's.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents resign their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and it is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific ideas were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself estranged from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various observed rhythms in physiology and behavior normally depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of continuous cycle, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns in the interior to go to work in other towns, and they run into other people who work in those small towns where they left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a private car-based transport system.
Science now points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the steady state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are seldom heard.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mothballs.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching nearly 10 kilometers across.
A total of 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, because they can all be discovered in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is simply a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it was first released.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a paper and less important use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and do not have to reach for a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission pump works on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then the nucleus splits again, and you get some of that energy out.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 kilometres thick on the visible side and 100 kilometres thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more sand on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two Factor theory.
In general terms, two behaviours may emerge as managers start to lead their former colleagues: One side of the spectrum tries to remain "part of the guys' (or girls') group".
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance appraisals, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels like you have to change everything the team has done and make your own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional staff members, as their teams may be in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning?
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and ingenuity come into play.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, so it narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioural pathology has been a stumbling block for scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to attend to customer inquiries and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology provides the solution with virtual field classes, where students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennet School develop a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a book of remembrance.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing, since students often start their contact with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, so the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north has the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
Because of all of these and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider to be the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
For the population comparison question that surprises many people: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, some distance off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which gained much popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama founded the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers state that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's because of cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's all right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Mermenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historical part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa's cheapest gorilla-climbing trails.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 CFR for a quick tour.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African touch.
Kruger National Park is in the northeast of South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 Km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to purchase a Wild Card, which can give you access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the edge of Kowloon, on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British settlers chose to live in, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove swamp in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) inward from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that have covered the remaining mangrove surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, one-third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, have 378 meters in length and two runways of 3.50 meters in width.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) and construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, the date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of its indigenous peoples' characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted. Please check with the owners in advance to find out what method of payment they accept.
It is virtually impossible to change the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or harassed.
Following the instructions of park officials, keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, buffalo, elk, and bear, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't get too close.
Furthermore, know that the odors attract bears and other wild animals, yet avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and the city is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two inlets. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not an elaborate beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may do better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're apprehensive.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards, the natural juices are expensive, but they're great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, occurring on the reef, are rare.
Continue to heed the reminders of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety alerts.
The cuboid occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and may occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is likely that you can book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your booking if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any change or request, it should first be directed to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll have to get there early so you can camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue to play late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, for crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the more sensitive.
Cruises in St Petersburg include sightseeing tours of the city.
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the place.
Some places offer alcohol on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever one is driving in high latitudes or on mountain roads, he should take into consideration the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to make you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the eye-catcher of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial usage, refers to trips by land to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them best with binoculars.
Also known as a "walk on the mat", "walking safari", or "passage", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing boards for borrowing, even if there is no one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear worn-out socks, you may try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, you may want to consider buying water filters from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can brute-force people to hurt or kill them, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on inland roads, be wary: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict obedience to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and in Bavaria they are quite whimsical and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit candies are a recurring feature, with roasted apples in the candies all year round, and cherries and plums making their presence felt during the summer.
Many German bakery wares also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes often go very well with a cup of very strong coffee.
If you want some small, yet tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a diverse one that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.

To provide support for a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems, as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal eventually runs away.
First, a large proportion of pilots wear riding boots with heels and flat soles, which are quite narrow.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.

In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly more distances than on foot  but only very rarely will you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through visa and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it's possible to cross the border without going through passport control posts again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques, some tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.

Back currents are the reflux of water from the waves on the beach back to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a fast current can be formed for deep water there.
