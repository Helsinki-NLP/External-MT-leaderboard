The City of Juankoske will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopiyo City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The city council of Juosank approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the liquidation of the municipal association, but its board decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent entity.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the joining of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111 000.
Indian and Japanese Prime Ministers meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, in his first major overseas visit since winning the May election.
The five-day visit to Japan is intended to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
The discussions focused on plans for expanded nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting at civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership on Monday of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in substantial political dialogue with the eastern part of the country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are being aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian military troops were shooting at civilians.
The aim of the militants is to push back these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the residents of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmkorvaamo.
It was surprising to see the crowd come in at the beginning of the night.
"The attendance was as expected over the two days", says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
I'll do it again next year.
We're going to be hip-hop festas, so there's no pop music allowed, says Kangas.
A law that restricts the acquisition of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives will come into force in Finland on Tuesday.
In future, private individuals will have to apply to the Police Administration for permission to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
For example, detergents and washing products contain hydrogen peroxide, but these do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used in accelerators, for example.
The Commission has not received any comments from interested parties on the application of the Act.
George Webster is accused of robbing the Nairn and Pitlochry hotels.
The accused in the two hotel rapes is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned in Glasgow's High Court in a closed session.
He is charged with the rape, which occurred at the Pitlochry Scotland Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman while she was unconscious, asleep, and thus incapable of making a decision for herself.
Webster is also charged with a second rape at the Nair Golf View Hotel in the Highlands on May 4, 2014.
As decided by Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Super Raheem was great Mario was left in the shadows
Raheem Sterling, just 19 years old, once again demonstrated why he is considered the future of English football.
It was an electric atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Sunday as Liverpool, who had been strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived to play for Tottenham.
The debut of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude from the days of Manchester City.
Balotelli was a long way from his top opponent.
The Italian missed three quality touchdown passes and only threw half of his 16 passes for his team.
Pool fans, who have already embraced the player, expect more.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers replaced Balotelli as the second-string player alongside Daniel Sturridge, replacing Luis Suarez, who had left for Barcelona.
The star of the team, instead of Balotelli, was the center-back, Raheem Sterling, who kicked the key goal in the 3-0 victory over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, is not just a powerhouse.
The Englishman, who is 20 centimeters shorter than Balotelli, is between the lines of the opponent like a fish in water.
It's not a common trait for a player who can run on the grass at a top speed of about 21 miles per hour.
And Rodgers has a lot to give to Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman told the crowd after the game how Liverpool had systematically developed a player from the North West London boy who grew up on Wembley's roots into a more comprehensive player.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the new chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have been asking which orchestra he's gonna take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she is happy and proud to start her new job.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in the musical life of our country for over a hundred years, including the performance of a large number of Sibelius' music.
The orchestra has been led by the finest Finnish conductors and I have worked with many of the orchestra members in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation", he says.
The administrative bodies of employers' organisations in the field of pension negotiations - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
The social partners' own meetings are giving new impetus to the pension negotiations.
The SAK, Akava and STTK administrations of the employers' organisations will be discussing the negotiating position in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to continue.
The social partners have, among other things, raised the issue of the linking of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a work solution by the fall, but the latest estimate is that it would be born this week.
The blowtorch.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team, Woman Volley, collided with the Vampula Athletes in the final of the Pihtiputaan training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula won the five-inning game 3-2.
The last round, WoVo lost 15 to 11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in defense and passing Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo's coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
The WoVu was so big that the six-foot-two American Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck to the side.
Sara Niemi played the center.
Karolina Kyllönen was a game player despite her thumb injury and formed the most powerful combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the Vampula was the skilled Russian passenger and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo spins as much as possible.
The preparation for the WoV league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK will come to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The teams will meet Saturday at the Merchant's House at 6:00 p.m. for the official practice game.
Sundays at the gymnasium are treated as a second.

The company released its earnings figures on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland and plans to continue expanding.
Lidl also informed that it paid almost EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4 200 employees in Finland.
Deaths from ovarian cancer are more common in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficulty in accessing treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers looked at the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35 percent of the women lived more than five years after their diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
NEW RESEARCH: New drugs may slow the growth of lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers looked at the women's health histories over a seven-year period.
Dr. Susan Jordan also said that a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous medical history, and socioeconomic status all contributed to her survival.
Older women and those with more extensive cancer had the lowest chance of survival at the time of diagnosis.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside urban areas are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan cites delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynecologic oncology specialists are the best at treating this disease, and their offices are mostly located in major cities", says Jordan.
In addition to the increasing use of telehealth and the decreasing importance of distance, the researcher proposes increasing the mobility of doctors to enable specialists to treat patients closer to their homes, and programmes to support patients receiving care from a distance.
Dr. Jordan's research shows that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are poor regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better care and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old housewife from the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with a malignant form of ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the rally car park operation in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
The City Council decided on Monday that the site plan for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be placed at a publicly visible service point in Osviitta.
The draft proposal is being examined by the Environmental Committee and the Lapland Life Centre.
The aim of the change of site is to allow the continuation of motorcycle tourism in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area, which includes the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
The proposal is that no more than 200 motorcycles may be permanently placed on the site between 15 November and 30 April.
The area may also include refuelling points for a specified part of the area.
The new park area will be open to service traffic.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the area of the Friendship Park to safari companies for use by motorized skiers during the winter.
The last renewal of the lease was in spring 2014 and the lease is valid until spring 2018.
The carnival action and the change of format have raised some very loud objections.
The residents of the neighbouring buildings have been concerned not only about the noise but also about the emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been studied and the reports do not reveal any findings above the guidance value.
The new vehicle is also more fuel efficient.
The park is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were moved further away, the hotel's safari guests would have to be transported to the departure points of the safari by buses, with an estimated 15 departures per day.
The area of the Friendship Park and the surrounding area are also sufficiently large for the kelk, according to the city, better than places proposed as alternative starting points, such as the eastern side of the Ounas River bridges next to the boat pier.
The location of the park is good, and it is also a good location for future expansion of activities, for example to the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of the park business is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good environment for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas at logistically and operationally advantageous locations.
The Ystävyyden park is also marked as the starting point for motorcycling in the central part of the city, which has not yet become legal.
The decline in owner-occupied housing is reflected in the decline in garden shops.
The decline in homeownership, especially among the under-35s, could lead to a decline in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the 'target' age group for garden sales, reported the Financial Times on the basis of a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the UK.
A Financial Times report says that renters spend only 55 percent of the money that landlords spend on gardening.
The study also found that more people are living in highly urbanised housing with no gardens, and that the garden is shrinking as more and more of the front yard is being used for parking, which are also threatening the garden sector, estimated to be worth around £5 billion a year.
In the greater London area home ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and it has the lowest per household spending on garden products in the country.
According to the HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), however, an increase in rents or a decrease in the size of a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, head of horticulture at the RHS, says that 'for example, plants grown in portable grow pots are particularly popular with apartment tenants because such grow pots can be incorporated into the move if necessary'.
According to the HTA report, the period 1997-2005 was a boom period for the resale of the garden sector, as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also forecasts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, following the poor weather in March and April last year.
Turkey is interrogating a U.S. diplomat over a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide an explanation for the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy's chief of staff and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have reported that leaked documents by Edward Snowden, a former analyst for the US National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main target of spying by the US and UK intelligence services.
Turkish news agencies report that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report, saying that all major powers have spied on each other.
An earlier report on the spying of the German intelligence service on Ankara provoked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze is in a new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been cast as the female lead in a new Finnish film.
Croze will play director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights to dawn, which starts shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the 2003 film Barbarely Invaded.
She has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's The Butterfly's Glass.
The male lead in 2 Nights at a Movie is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will have its Finnish premiere in September 2015.
The police chief of Magaluf in Mallorca is accused of corruption
The whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvián City officials at the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the Mallorcan holiday island of Magaluf, a region known for its wet and festive atmosphere, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shop and bar owners.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under pre-trial detention after several business owners in Punta Ballena Street, where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the whistleblowers presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvián City Council officials at the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard in Spain on corruption charges and are being questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC wrote that nightclub owners were furious at the bias of the authorities, which was significantly hampering their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival", one business owner told the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video went viral showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island's authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, drunken pub crawl.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was ordered to close for one year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of the pub crawling were ordered to pay a combined fine of EUR 55 000.
The so-called balcony trend has also become popular, especially among young British tourists in the popular Magaluf tourist area, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents, with people jumping from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after a summer spent in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars pounded their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the communities of southern Israel, where rockets were fired, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers at the Pashosh day care center removed the debris from the walls and the slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care center.
'We are a little scared but also excited,' says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, in an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher in a local school.
Many of the children in this area are in dire need of routines.
Shani Bart, Bart's 11-year-old daughter, feels that going back to school after a long time feels "a little strange".
"We have had some difficult times where we didn't leave home for anything", she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or moved from their homes to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape the rocket and grenade fire.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are skeptical about returning after a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian grenade in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fighting.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that 'their education and safety would be taken care of'.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockades and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, the war has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disputed the death toll, saying at least half of those killed were military, though it has no hard evidence of that.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south, during the fighting.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to over 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and the fighting continuing, school officials postponed the start of school the previous week.
'I hope that the school will open soon and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,' said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a shelter at a school in Gaza City.
The commonly used yardstick for the seven years of the highest increase in house prices is the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic price index, which measures the price of housing in Australia's capital, rose 1.1 percent in August, according to data from RP on Monday.
With the rise in the summer, July and August periods, prices rose by a total of 4.2%, more than in the same months since 2007.
The Commission has not received any comments from interested parties regarding the increase in the average price of the product concerned during the investigation period.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
Results from RP Data show that house prices rose by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next in the list, with an average increase of five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Mr Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of homes on sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
Given the increase in the sale of homes for sale, the generally vigorous sales rate and the continued low interest rate, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise during the next three months, says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record numbers of visitors to Mäntt
The new museum and art gallery have attracted record numbers of visitors this summer to the Mint.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors had visited the Serlachius Museum of Art.
The new Gösta museum opened in June and has featured pop art classics by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
The European Union is also looking to the EU to provide a framework for the development of the EU's external relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
These are numbers we're not used to.
People have been sleeping on the doors and windows", says Pauli Sivonen, director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums this year will be close to 100,000.
In previous years, there were about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppulas, which is halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has a population of about 11,000.
The museum director, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent", he says.
We hope the artistic season will continue long after the summer.
The art museum is opening new exhibitions this fall.
Police are investigating four robberies in the last few days in Kajan.
On Sunday night, a commercial building on North Avenue was broken into with a broken window.
The perpetrator had taken a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, a truck on Deep Snow Street was robbed of fuel from its tank.
Between Sunday and Monday, the boat with the rear engines was taken from the Pettenese boatyard.
The boat was a Kalapalta-type tugboat, white on the outside and with a basement.
Inside, on the front side, was the inscription "OIVA".
A couple of the suspects in the robbery have already been arrested by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into on the Little Bighorn Road.
A police officer was tracked down and a two-armed man from the coast was found hiding in the woods under a pine tree.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamos, suspected of the same crime.
A missing amphetamine led to a murder charge in Cajain .
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine has brought a case of murder against a man born in 1977 in Cajun.
According to the prosecutor, the man had entered the apartment with his partner and another man and shot with a shotgun a 34-year-old woman from Kayan, the suspected owner of the apartment.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed he had another man with him as the shooter.
The police were alerted to the incident when a police patrol stopped a car with a group of people who were burning clothes used in the massacre.
In addition to the burnt clothes, the car was found with a shotgun cut off.
The Kainuun Court of Appeal will rule on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the National Weather Service, an August of this temperature occurs on average once every 10 years.
The National Weather Service's statistics show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was between one and two degrees.
The heat of June and August made the whole summer warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the entire summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the thermometer showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never wanted me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, in the British Midlands, in 1958, the seventh child in a family of seven.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when he was 19, so the relationship between the son and the father was distant.
Henry is currently rehearsing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on a fictional conversation he had with his father and is based on a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat style.
Henry has had to go through some painful childhood memories.
She's been in therapy a lot since her mother died, and she's been thinking a lot about her relationship with her father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
I never saw his face, only a voice saying, "Stop making noise".
Leave your sister alone.
Move it out!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults by the time I was a child, would go to the pub with my father and discuss such things as the shape of a beer can or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was that grinning man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal foundry in Dudley, and he got a glimpse of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are better today than they were then.
The melting rooms are now a little brighter but are basically dark, smoky, labyrinthine abyssals, bursting with flames, smoke, and smoke, and reminiscent of the underworld.
Dad used to go in the bath and just bathe the floor, and quietly he would start singing to himself as he washed the smelting house dirt off of himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had worked for years to get food on our table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness that parents provide.
My father never wanted me, never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother became ill shortly before she died that we started to tell each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through his own child, he's been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to say "I love you" all the time?
Stop with the hugging!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why can't we be friends?
She 's a great mother .
Henry is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why can't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that my mother died.
When I began to suffer from severe weight problems and diabetes, my doctor ordered a complete reversal.
After that I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce my symptoms.
It's very difficult.
and boring.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's famous short beard perhaps reflects his change of career.
After receiving a lot of positive feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he has immersed himself in the making of the theater.
Next up was The Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences.
And doing theater is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was just 16 years old, working in a factory.
A disc jockey spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV", he says.
Henry learned it on the job.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the sidelines from 1975 to 1985, while living as a star and being on television.
Lenny New Faces at the 1975 competition
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which characters were dressed up in black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like that.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been a part of it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was awkward and disgusting, I got to work at large events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet the award-winning, long-time favourite and light entertainment programme of Britti-TV was also a "deafening parody of black people".
Henry worked on another comedy series in the '80s that both poked fun at and celebrated black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s, Henry was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!
The next decade was spent in commercials, documentaries, TV series and film scenes, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he said to himself: What are you going to do next, Len now it looks like you're just going to be standing on the spot or driving on the sidewalk.
Next up was the Channel 4 documentary What's So Great About...?
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wore socks and had money.
That's why the subject of Shakespeare scared me.
All the people we interviewed on the show -- Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench -- they all said to me, "Try it.
Don't throw the idea out the window until you know what you're talking about.
Date the words and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put back in.
This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your lines, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was a success in the end.
Apparently, they expected it to fail, but it didn't exactly.
Shortly after, Henry was cast in the lead role in the comedy The Misfits.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre of Great Britain, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I had this thought: "Oh, you've changed".
Once, there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt it was his job to entertain the audience.
A little voice in my head said to me, "You have to make it 10 minutes alone until the computer is working again".
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It's not my responsibility.
I can leave it to others to deal with.
You're part of the play, stay in character
Henry Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words to the show "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes you more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods: "This is what you must do".
This is what Henry says in a CUMB voice, of course.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love the rehearsal rooms.
Yet, Henry is still a comedian at heart: Little humor pups interrupt our conversation constantly as he switches from one imitation to another.
It is a matter of will to refrain from stand-up comedy, since receiving direct praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it no longer excites me in the same way as it used to.
I'm gonna go see Henry, see if he's still up for another stand-up tour.
I have a real pleasure in sitting with a guide who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is her new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really fun.
Acting is always telling a story, and I love that.
I love the stories.
People love stories, you know?
Kenya is setting up a register of civil servants to remove 'morning workers'
Kenya has started to establish a biometric registry of public officials in an attempt to remove "foreign workers" from government payroll.
Workers who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive their pay, the government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid after they leave their posts.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to crack down on public sector corruption when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million a month was spent on the wages and other financial abuses of "black workers".
The government suspects that salaries are paid into the account even after the person has died or left office, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials will have to register themselves in the coming weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in the biometric registration form, the government press release said.
The notice says that anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payroll.
'This measure will significantly restructure the public sector, as it will determine how many people are actually working in their jobs, and it will also clean up the payroll at both levels of government, solving the 'problem of the blue-collar workers',' says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result of the 2015 financial year for Seinäjo could be a deficit of EUR 25,5 million unless the city adjusts its activities and its expenditure development in the context of a tight economic situation.
The current budgetary procedure is likely to result in an annual deficit of about 9.4 million.
The potential means of improvement were the reduction in the scope and level of services, the purchase of services, the sale of property and grants, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
The total investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8,5 million.
The situation in the municipalities is not going to improve.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the inadequate growth of tax revenues, the rising unemployment rate and the 5% cut in the state contributions further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city council is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the strategic goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, the chairman of the city council.
The City Council returned the submitted proposals for further preparation by the management team.
The City Council's proposals will form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal is submitted to the city council and the city council through the committee.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "plotting against the government"
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government conspiracy", local media sources report.
Police officials did not immediately comment.
The Hurriyet Daily News reported that 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the officers were involved in last December's corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal gang and monitoring phone calls.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) said the police actions were part of the planned operation of Islamist leader Fethullah Gulen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1), after the summer holidays.
This is a traditional day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
While telling reporters waiting for him that not all schools have reopened, he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
Not every school held a September First Day ceremony.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the head teacher of the Slavic school where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that the children will be able to learn a lesson that will benefit them in the future.
Traditionally, the first day of school includes the wearing of children's lettered shirts, the firing of balloons, and the presentation of flowers to teachers.
Perry, Texas, says the tweeting was illegal.
A graphic picture of the Democratic district attorney in the middle of a hearing on abuse of power allegations was posted on the Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry late Sunday night.
The tweet was later deleted, and was followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent from my account without my permission.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I've deleted it", the post said.
Perry's backing troops did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Even though the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a derogatory joke about Travis's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury in Austin this month with Perry as the accused.
The tweet was titled, "I don't always drive drunk, with three times the permitted amount of alcohol by volume... but when it does, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has always maintained his innocence and called the allegations a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the charges, saying the law under which Texas' longest-serving governor is being indicted is flawed when viewed in terms of constitutionality.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state public integrity unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector prosecutions, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's verified Twitter account is regularly updated  and sometimes famously.
After coming fifth in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by tweeting a picture of himself jogging on a lake with the text "From here to South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to "normal".
One of London's leading developers has warned that the housing market in the South East of England has "returned to normal" levels of activity.
The capital city of London has been plagued by a huge demand for housing and a sharp rise in prices, along with fears of a widespread credit crunch, which prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on housing loans in June.
The founder and chairman of high-tech developer Berkeley, Tony Pidgley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the fiscal year, markets and trading have returned to normal after a 2013 peak", adding that this has allowed for "a stable operating environment".
The housing market in London was doing well during the recession, with foreign investors flocking to the capital.
According to the Maarekister, house prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, clearly exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
Average prices for private, affordable and student housing in Berkeley rose by about one-fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound has made London property less attractive in recent months - some of the reasons for this have also been the new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible 'money tax' ahead of the general election in May.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April housing line report, which reported tighter lending regulations, would lead to a low level of market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Property broker Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for London property prices, saying prices will fall by three per cent as the index, which measures homeowners' opinions on prices, has already begun to weaken.
The number of deals in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter compared to last year, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
But the demand for housing in the capital is a boon to Berkeley, which has increased the revenue from properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that 'demand for the right product, designed with great care, in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained strong'.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to April, almost a third more than in the peak pre-crisis year of 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits were up 40 percent year-on-year to £380 million, and turnover up 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday, before the company's annual meeting, that Berkeley's earnings for the year are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full year's pre-tax profit is £450 million.
The Berkeley share was trading steady at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
A hacker leaked a nude photo of Jennifer Lawrence to the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have the photos of 100 other stars has leaked the nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence to the Internet.
A representative of the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are authentic and denounced the hacker for "a brazen violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be charged.
The images, originally posted on the 4chan photo-publishing site, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a flaw in Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other hacked stars is said to include dozens of other female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's unclear how much of the footage is real, though Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those of you who are looking at pictures of me and my husband taken in the privacy of our home years ago, I hope you have a good heart", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon series "Carly" and "Victorious" denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are RED, don't you understand?"
Let me finish this right from the start .
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that a representative for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
The only excerpt we're releasing is from Howard Jacobson's new novel, which he's thankfully written, about love and the letter "J".
They slipped, that's the best way to describe what happened, gradually they fell apart like a cardboard box caught in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear her say that she was too serious, intrusive, intense, detached, and perhaps a little prickly.
And then he waved.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was sharp as a tack.
The last victim of her spikes had been a relationship in its infancy, but one that had been promising; one that had seemed to ease her lonely boredom and perhaps even to give some meaning to her life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a gentle, easy-going beauty with a cheerful heart, from a northern village even more remote and remote than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern assumed to be her aunt, who had inherited a house in a wet but paradiselike valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in that house for years.
The pipes were leaking, spiders were in all the bathrooms, the spiders had left their mark on the windows, making the whole place their own, and weeds were growing in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like a children's fairy tale, both menacing and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by Howard Jacobson, whose novel J is a contender for the 2014 Booker Prize for Fiction.
The nominations will be announced next week .
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on broken-down, steel chairs in the middle of a long grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both of them distracted by the reception, through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, as Ailin's crossed, sun-tanned legs brought to Kevern's mind a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer, and often heard by his father on the cabin's loudspeakers downstairs.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were inherently too aggressive, and they were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren't banned. Nothing was banned. They just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as was the word "forgotten".
Public opinion accomplished what the laws and the proclamation of the pan had not: just as in the field of literature people preferred to read heroic memoirs, cookbooks, and romances, so in the field of music they preferred ballads.
As the day raged on, Kevern began to tap an imaginary piano and serenade Ailynn's big feet with a brash, raspy voice.
Ailinn didn't understand what I was saying.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller", Kevern told him, and he naturally held up two fingers to his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped his lips.
It started as a game between her and her father when she was little.
His dad told me he played the same game as his dad.
If you said a word beginning with "J" and didn't remember to put two fingers in your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't much fun then, and it's not much fun now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
And jazz wasn't actually outlawed, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one if-word.
As the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to the curiosity.
The unpredictability of it made people nervous.
And jazz was a kind of wit, played out through music.
Although Kevern had never heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or coercion was needed.
A loyal society meant that each of its members accepted with gratitude, as if by a stroke of luck, the principle that each group did things that were natural to it.
Because of their temperament and physical characteristics, Afro-Caribbean people were best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian mainland, they were like natural talents with electrical devices, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working telephone that they could use to run their business.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When THAT HAPPENED, THAT HAPPENED came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled vigorously in fear of being accused of starting the flames and fearing that the flames would catch them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning water pipe and continued to live their lives looking at the ground as bones and masons of dullness.
Each one according to his own ability.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for her to understand how Kevern's words that offended the poets had ever been set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe for the bigfoot.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound of the leaves of the giant cabbage-headed plants.
But Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips with Ailin.
Ailinn already thought he was a freak.
"My father thought it was funny", he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
All you see in the world is Ailinn's huge, black-haired hair.
It's all she wanted to see.
"If you say so", she said, but she didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't exactly big.
Your ankle, maybe, is a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too early for that.
I think you're attractive because of your big ankles. He was trying to make things right.
I'm a pervert in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm that could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite her kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her terrace chair and simultaneously dropped the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only from the backbone, so he couldn't use that as a reason for the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what I'm twistedly attracted to in you", he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that was in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he was going to hit?
He had never told Kevern about the life on the rugged northern islands where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that, at its core, it had been like life here.
The same huge, swelling sea that waved against them.
The same deranged men, although after the murder even more pale and more evil than their smuggler and raging fathers, roamed from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Fat head?
He'd have seen a fat fist if he hadn't been careful!
"Suck first" had become the most common word for a man and woman's erotic encounter; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads that pumped out the receiver was "suck first and then attack".
Kevern thought that was too much, because sucking was hostile in itself.
Ailinn Solomon's body language was telling him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the balcony like an old man.
Ailinn felt exhausted too, but Kevern's depth of grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched her go - just as her companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window - the man who was the cause of her difficult life.
Adam, leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A back-turned, sullen, shy, beaten man, who had lost all will to fight  why did he feel that the sight was so familiar to him, even though he could not remember having seen anything like it before this moment?
And when Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the events described above, the brilliant and passionate 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Ofnow, a private think tank that measures public opinion, did a short study on the persistence of low- and middle-level violence in those parts of the country where the likelihood of violence decreasing, or even ending, was highest, given the amount of money and energy spent to combat it.
"Much has been accomplished, and much remains to be done", he wrote, "to counterbalance the inherent aggressiveness of a people that has fought and often won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and isolated hills where, despite the towers that stretch over the hills, human humility is rarely felt in the present age".
But there are some things that cannot be eliminated completely.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
While people weep over sentimental ballads, reel in stories of triumph, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, the old-fashioned cruelty is still rampant in rural communities and urban neighborhoods alike, and there is evidence of a new, more unpleasant, wave of strife in homes, workplaces, our streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize", his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down at the ground.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme further invoked its right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Silence again.
'I'm not asking,' said Luther Rabinowitz, 'because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
This is a non-prejudicial workplace.
We are the servants of an unprejudiced society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as the ones you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church, and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
To dwell on WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the basic vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light announced the message that Ofnow had been delivering to Earth for the past quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and a sung word is better than a written one, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum replied in a low voice, when she was sure that her instructor had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I'm worried that if we're not warned, we'll find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT WE WANTED, WHEN WE WANTED.
But this time, we will not vent our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz, with his fingers, formed a pyramid.
This gesture was one of endless patience.
"You're going too far", he said, "by describing as mistakes" the things our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far to say that they "pour out their anger and mistrust upon others".
A man in your position shouldn't have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we don't talk about "us" or "them".
There was nothing "we" or "me".
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know.
'To be perfectly honest, in the chaos,' Esme dared to continue, 'no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, for good or bad.
That was then.
We have no need to talk about it any more. We agree on this.
And just as there is no need to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and there is no way to make them.
But what's the point of the past if you don't learn from it?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his own pyramid.
"I'll go through your report", he said, indicating that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he was going to work as usual, he was struck by a motorcycle rider on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "brash and furious".
There are accidents.
Lesotho army denies planning an attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied staging a coup to overthrow the government and said they were acting against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighboring South Africa after being told that he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the strike and said the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics".
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause trouble", he told the Voice of America news agency.
Clayson Monyella, the president of the South African government, said the military's actions seemed like an attempt at revolution.
'Although no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be in all respects consistent with the characteristics of the attempt to revolutionise,' he says.
According to Lesotho Army officials, soldiers will be returning to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because of his efforts to fight corruption.
Tensions have been building in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions over disagreements with the grand coalition government.
He denies that he has thus slighted the authority of the government, although others say otherwise.
The Netherlands: Microsoft to set up a data centre in the Netherlands
The computer technology company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in the Netherlands, but the company refuses to specify the location.
In a press release, Microsoft states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
The center is already fully equipped and connected to the network, according to Microsoft.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
The city was formerly known as Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will close its Oulu office completely, which will result in the loss of about 500 jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1 050 employees in Finland.
Microsoft's director of communications, Camilla Lindfors, told STT that the company would not comment on how many people the new data centre would employ.
The establishment of the data centre was announced to the Netherlands by the newspaper Kauppalehti on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have a number of different equipment options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I took these pictures myself at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts are sealed to prevent water from leaking.
Also, set the camera's image settings to match the pictures or videos you take.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and camcorders have a setting that optimizes the underwater shooting conditions.
 Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep you can take your device.
Some cameras can only survive a depth of 5 feet, others can survive depths of 50-60 feet.
See both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures  many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to zoom in on the picture, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a bunch of pictures.
If your camera also allows for zooming, which means taking multiple pictures at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly dimmed as you go deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also adds color to your pictures; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important tip for shooting on land, but even more important underwater, because of the low light conditions.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle, meaning that the photographer must be close to the subject to fill the entire frame.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders  protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The ruling is likely to spark long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists began planning and executing demonstrations just hours after the ruling was announced.
The decision by the Chinese People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to eliminate any candidates who don't obey Beijing.
'This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating,' says Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party, a lawmaker.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the people of Hong Kong.
It's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Li Fei, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that running as a general candidate in the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK handed Hong Kong over to China, Beijing has promised the people of the territory that it will be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
The decision, which Chinese leaders said was a democratic breakthrough, allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but also made clear that China wants to tightly control the election process through a nominating committee run from Beijing.
The new clause says only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the ruling, Hong Kong saw some of the largest and most high-profile protests in the region in years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business-world cartel unless Beijing grants Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement of the resolution, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main administration buildings.
In the rally, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement was moving into a new era of civil disobedience and that they would cause waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not reveal the details, apparently fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organisers said the movement "considers the Occupy Central movement as a last resort, to be used only if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way".
We regret to inform you that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been ruined and the takeover of the center will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security was tight around the main government buildings, with police and barricades in place.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the people are quietly losing control of their city.
The wave of continental arrivals has created competition for goods and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are being eroded under the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized Occupy Central for threatening Hong Kong's livelihood  business community.
'The protest they are talking about could lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts,' says legislator Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
That would be a bad image to invest in.
Chinese state media has also presented stories that Hong Kong democracy activists are the handlers of the revolution-loving Western powers.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
The American prom tradition is hitting the British universities: private jets for new students
We are thrilled to be responding to demand by creating Britain's first luxury travel package for today's students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure that the customer can make a memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart said there's a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise haul their possessions across the country in loaded cars.
When combined with the many VIF features (VIP Friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and highest quality transport to university.
The company representative said that no reservations had been received yet, as the service was newly established, but added that "students will start ordering in the weeks following the event".
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students have very different expectations and aspirations than they did when they started their studies 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago, and it's more important than ever to make a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the National Union of Students criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Higher Education Division of the organisation, 'this service plan seems to be very far from the lives of the majority of students'.
Many who start their studies this month are shocked by the cost of living, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has lagged behind the dramatic rise in the cost of living, and only then can we begin to wonder where we can find thousands to spend on something as simple as getting to campus.
Ipswich's "scallo" is on sale
Real estate agents removed a picture of a house in Suffolk for sale after noticing a picture of a large pig lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house, which is priced at £120,000, is situated on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig rested its head on the sofa.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
However, the image was accidentally included in the notification and has since been removed, a company representative said.
In the notice, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres's departure is confirmed. Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund.
Spanish striker Fernando Torres was guaranteed to leave Chelsea, but a substitute came in with almost the same doorbell.
Chelsea have announced that they have signed a four-year deal with French striker Loic Remy from neighbouring QPR.
The price of the deal is 13 million euros, according to the magazine.
Torres, 30, joins AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50 million four years ago, but never quite lived up to expectations.
The unsuccessful trip to Manchester United by Japanese player Shinji Kagawa also ended.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU transfer.
According to press reports, the price is about 8 million euros.
Kagawan's new contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Super League.
Now I'm happy to be a Dortmund man again.
"This is a great team and a wonderful environment", Kagawa said.
The second Bundesliga club, the Berliner Hertha, is confirmed at Salomon Kalulla.
The Ivory Coast attacker will be transferred to Hertha from Lille in France, and the transfer fee is estimated at around €3 million.
Before Lille Kalou, 29, played for Chelsea from 2006-12.

In the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois, 11 people were injured, four of them seriously, in the accident on Sunday.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors from the rubble of the house on Monday, but hopes of finding survivors faded.
The initial cause of the explosion is suspected to be a gas leak.
The blast occurred early Sunday and was so powerful that it leveled buildings within a hundred yards.
Our whole house was shaking: we were shaking with fear.
The explosion was so loud that our ears rang", described Maryline Yyvon, a neighbor of the crash site.
An emergency shelter was set up for the residents of the building near the school on Sunday.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful protest, they voiced their desire to restore the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
The salary increases are also to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new hours for a month now, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour work schedule.
Despite a meeting between the prison workers' association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are currently underway, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the General Directorate for the Enforcement of Sentences, told BNR.
The prison workers' union is expected to be joined by members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Basketball: the fans encouraged almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Sasu Salin's basketball was the epitome of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his crash in the U.S. Open and beat the Ukrainian second half with his bloody decisions.
But Salin gave all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was gonna pass out on that field at the end, that was such a great motivation.
I couldn't help it.
I was almost overwhelmed by all that noise and white audience.
Salini's moments of power included nine fast-paced surfaces, balloon slides, plate holes and the occult in every place where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a state of flow where everything worked.
They just come from somewhere, sometimes, now to a place of utter importance, Sasu bragged.
It's my role.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was nice to see that others had caught the plot.
It's got the whole gang.
Salin is the cheerleader and the spirit of the team, so it is no wonder that his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big, tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years: The previous one was remembered for the rude refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland in the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish player in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second-choice coach of Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
One thing Kosonen and Parkkali remember from the tournament as if it were yesterday: it was a fiery match against France in the opening round.
"The decision balls in that match were a blatant game of refereeing", recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams were already set back.
Suddenly, the game was on.
We lost 2-3 and then the match got even more confusing", Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montosen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is back in the world's favourites as the World Cup in Poland kicks off on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball during the past 32 years.
The strengths of the players are about the same as before, but the quality and skill are now higher.
The players' averages have also increased.
The game is faster than ever", thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish players' equipment has been expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to make it from the first round to the next.
"It's not easy to do that", Kosonen said.
The Seagull
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on the attack in the winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent, Jouni Parkkali, was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope this time we're gonna get 17th.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bankrupt", said Parkkali.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the second-in-command of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were the fans in the match against Tunisia.
The sauna and evening workout at the Buenos Aires Sailor's Church were part of the national team's program for the 1982 World Cup.
Kari Kalin (oik.) stretched with his teammates.
The finals of the Young Star Song Contest have been contested - no winner in South Karelia
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen, who reached the finals of the Young Star singing competition, did not advance to win the competition.
No other entries are published in the competition.

It's a good experience.
The finalists are still playing the songs from the competition.
"I always have a good memory of the races", says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the credit"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank those who helped her once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog that was with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his calf.
The injured dog was unable to walk on steep ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
"I tried many times to entice it and pull it forward a little, but its legs just wouldn't carry", Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help was forthcoming from the police, the nearby hotel or passers-by.
By the time the night was over, the situation was already looking threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers happened to be there, ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father, Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway, Galdhøpiggen, and were heading for their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain ridge.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon a German man with a hiking mat also happened to be there.
The mattress Citalle found was matched to the matches that the injured dog was attached to.
The German man came in a moment after us, after we had been trying to decide what to do with the dog, and carried him down the slope for a while, Soini says.
The film is directed by Tuomo Soini.
The dog was carried down with a sledgehammer.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically demanding, but the difficult terrain made carrying the heavy load slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, the Cita was successfully lowered.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched Facebook for "international heroes" so he could thank them once again.
The rings answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German is still unaccounted for.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people, because I feel like I haven't thanked them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and all the honor, and I am forever grateful to them.
By Monday night, the Soins were on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen:
Susanna Mälkki is introduced as the principal cellist of the Helsinki City Orchestra
The three-year period would start in autumn 2016 and end in spring 2019.
The show also includes an option for two additional seasons.
Mälkki started his career as a cellist.

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared death for years because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her youth thinking that she had only a few years left to live because she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of hereditary disorders that damage the peripheral nerves of the brain and spinal cord.
According to the charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms of motor problems such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and tingling in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he turned 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two says that as a child she knew that she could not do the things that other people could.
I fell down every day, and I held on to everything longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several operations on his Achilles tendon to straighten his legs, and when the doctor left the surgery room, he quickly looked at his medical records, which said that he had AF.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and in a panic.
I thought I would be confined to a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and die before I was 25, and in between, I would slowly lose all my mobility.
I went through this myself, and I planned my own funeral.
Rodgers relates that by the time he was 17, he realized that his gait had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair".
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Some genetic tests have been done on him and he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was being delayed", she says.
The charity CMT UK is organising CMT Month to raise awareness of the disease.
A hundred migrants were found in a coal-burning truck in Macedonia .
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's Interior Ministry said on Monday.
The traffickers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going", said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about €3,000 each to get to Greece, and another €800-900 to get to Serbia.
A large number of illegal immigrants are crossing the country of Macedonia, which has a population of two million, on their way to Western Europe.
Already, three million people have fled Syria's bloody civil war.
Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
The Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai pop groups have joined the pro-independence movement in Scotland.
According to the Guardian, the bands are aiming for a gig in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence is to be held on 18 September.
In his announcement, Mogwai said the vote was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scots.
In the past, actors like Sean Connery have come out in support of independence.
Instead, British stars like Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In Gallupe, the pro-independence forces have been defeated.
The difficulties of the warehouses continued in the middle of the summer .
The decline in the retail trade continued in July, according to the Finnish Retail Trade Association.
According to the report, the turnover of the supermarket and hypermarket chains in July was 3,2% lower than a year ago.
The worst hit was the sale of home and leisure products, with turnover down by more than 7% from a year ago.
Clothing sales were also markedly lower than in the previous summer.
The value of retail sales of everyday goods, on the other hand, increased by almost 3% year-on-year in July.
The biggest increase was in retail stores and large supermarkets.
In the first half of the year, i.e. January to July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has decreased by more than two per cent.
By contrast, sales of everyday goods have increased by almost 1%.

The house was donated to Bottas by Nastola, who owned a 1.4-hectare beach house - worth about €60,000
The Municipal Government of Nastola donated a 1.4 hectare beach pond to Valtteri Bottas on the shore of Lake Kärkmäen in Villähte.
The municipal council showed a fair sense of sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no sound at the meeting when the plot was decided, says the mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
The Bottes Gift Plot has the farm buildings, seven of them.
The city's gonna be dismantling all but one of them this year.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the property within two years.
We are delighted that she has enjoyed her birth mother and wishes to be here in the future.
Every year, Valtteri has visited the elementary school to tell about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully, he'll keep going, the mayor says.
The mayor estimates the value of the beach house at between EUR 40000 and EUR 60000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
For decades, Nastola has maintained successful athletes in the municipality with varying success through donations.
The world champion in javelin throwing Aki Parviane and the world champion in aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo got their own houses from the municipality and built their own houses.
However, instead of staying in Nastola, they sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastolya to look for work and then moved when their living situation changed.
Bottas is a native Nastalan and his situation is different, the Syrian is a native and believes Bottas will remain in his home town.
Hull beat Hernandez with a club record .
The Hull City Football Club invested a record amount in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, a Uruguayan international.
Hernandez is going to Hulli from Palermo for £9.5 million, which is about €12 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B and were promoted to the Italian top flight.
In the national team of Uruguay he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
In the World Series last summer, Hernandez came in as a substitute in two games.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time", said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
The Russian space probe failed . The geckos sent on a sex mission died .
Five baby geckos sent into space by Russia for breeding have died, the Russian Federation space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Geeks traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and the use of geckos in a weightless environment.
The experiment involved one male and four females.
As strange as this experiment sounds, it was meant for a serious purpose.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of eggs, for example.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on humans who remain in this condition for extended periods, observed the New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says that the time of death and cause or causes of death of the geckos will be determined.
Interfax news agency reports that passengers who were identified as "sexy geeks" froze to death.
Another surprise is that the fruit flies that were on board the same Foton-M4 made it through the journey without any trouble, and they also produced offspring.
France has arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport .
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old suspected recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities announced the incident on Sunday.
Authorities tracked down the man after he lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
She was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, and alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
Authorities say he's from Chechnya, but he's living in France.
French intelligence had been following the man's movements before.
The French authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people lured into the wars in Iraq and Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or those registered in France have travelled to, returned from or are currently planning to travel to Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning .
The basketball team's hopes for a place in the playoffs are at stake as Finland meets Ukraine in the second game of the World Cup today.
If the opening to the US was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains.
Ukraine is a good team, but I think we have a good chance of winning, says Koponen.
In their first game of the tournament on Saturday, Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is the leader of the Ukrainian team in aggressive basketball.
The key player for Ukraine is the team's director, Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister, Carmelita Jeter, is the world champion in the 100-meter dash for the third year in a row.
Jeter had 16 against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter a fast guy, but yes we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defence in order, Koponen said.
Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in yesterday's loss to the United States.
We have to rediscover our strengths.
"I can guarantee that the field will see a normal wolf pack", Möttölä said.
The alleged nude images of Hollywood stars are circulating online - some of them confirmed authentic
A number of nude photos of famous celebrities are circulating on the Internet.
Among the victims of the "snap shot" campaign is actress Jennifer Lawrence.
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives threaten.
TMZ reports that actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her that are circulating are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed long ago, I can only imagine the gruesome trouble involved.
"I feel compassion for all who were hacked", she writes on the site.
But the actress Victoria Justice says that the images that are under her name are fake.
There are also at least some genuine or faked underwear images of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The hockey goalie criticized his teammates, saying, "They're not working hard enough to get out of here".
The football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitalan on Sunday after the V.P.S. match well describe the confused state of affairs in the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything", Viitala said after the match, which ended in a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the poor defensive play.
The players' movement in Hong Kong has been very active this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viitalan have also changed their rhythm.
With the game of roulette, many young gamblers have also been given opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here", Viitala said, without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat of the same mind as Viitalan.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a cheerleader and don't need to work, then you're probably on the wrong team", Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids a lot of playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when the partners are constantly changing.
This season, there have been no two consecutive draws.
Especially in the defensive end, the team's changed.
It is the main reason why we are in this position", said Kuqi.
Honka is in the playoffs after losing to VPS, tied with second-to-last TPS.
With seven rounds of the Champions League remaining, the Espoo boys still have time to avoid being relegated to Division One.
I've never dropped a team before, and I'm not about to drop one now.
We are definitely not going to drop out of this series", the goalkeeper Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier, after a decades-long hiatus, is making a TV series
Film director Lars von Trier is planning to return to television series.
The dance director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was announced by Louise Vesth, a producer of Trier films, on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
Production company Zentropan said in a press release that the series is expected to begin filming in 2016.
Trier is reportedly working on a script for the series starting this fall.
It's an English show.
The secret project is also being discussed in the press release by Trier's long-time partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his tough sales pitches.
He said that such a series "has never been seen before and will never be seen again".
"Hold your breath", Aalbæk Jensen says in the press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, is known in recent years for his high-profile media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
For television, he directed the 1990s series The Kingdom.

The first stores were opened in 2002.
A jaw from an Ice Bucket contestant
British woman Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly that the ice-cold water poured on her and damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge ended in a painful way.
A woman has been taken to a hospital after she screamed while completing the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jaw bones dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed, I felt my jaw start to stiffen", she tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British man who participated in a supercharged challenge on Tuesday was taken to hospital where his jaw was reattached.
The video has become an Internet sensation, and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View of the wolf howling: How can the increase in the number of wolves be explained?
I had a great time today.
These were the words of basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland played against France in the European Championship final at the Marous Ballroom in Athens.
I'm not exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the 100 or so Finns who shouted into the otherwise empty hall, which attracted 20,000 spectators.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine.
There are 80 Finnish soldiers in Bilbao.
The 1995 European Championships were the golden age of Finnish basketball.
The men fought their way to the final by winning the Russian qualification match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
A victory like that would open the door to the European system.
Everything seemed to be fine.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttö.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann has put Möttöla on the final team of the tournament.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now, Dettmann was a wise man, even if it didn't go exactly as planned.
After the athlete, the basketball team went deep.
The Finnish delegation at the Athens Games was reportedly just over a hundred.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
Bilbao has journalists, relatives, coaches, but it also has fans.
And there are many.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I guess nobody can say exactly how many Finnish tourists there are.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever number is in between those two, it's an unimaginable number.
Here's what you're gonna have to explain to the sports psychologist.
In a global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
In sports, there is still a chance to see how we are doing internationally.
With increased mobility, we can visit to see how our daughters and sons are doing in the world", says Hannu Itkonen, a professor of sports sociology.
I'm sure there are Finns in Spain and at the World Cup in Poland looking for a new adventure.
A shared experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Even in sports, you have to have a certain appeal.
Itkonen is elevating sports as part of popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to a sports event than to Berlin to see art.
But without success, the masses can't move.
Let's go back to the year 1995.
That's when Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and the players to throw themselves into the sport professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the tide turned and the national team was elevated to the top of the ladder.
The balloonist made the same move a little earlier.
Now they're both enjoying the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sport, where the holy trinity operates: sports media sponsors.
It'll make the audience care.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival-like support is, the cry reminds us.
Can the ball games translate this massive interest into domestic series?
In basketball and volleyball, the average is hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
Crying is a good question, and it doesn't necessarily give you an answer that promises the best for the species.
Another school believes that interest will pass.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
These guys are ready for the adventure of a lifetime, but their basic mindsets are not interested in the home series.
It's a challenge for the companions in the midst of the drug.
Bottas's land is secured - nearly 1.5 acres of lakefront.
Nastola is giving a beach house to Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas.
The city council approved the transfer of the 1.4 acre site unanimously at its meeting Monday.
Tonti's building a vacation home in the future.
The company has been tracking Bottas' success since his karting days.
He is considered a good ambassador for the market in Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The Gift Pond is located in the town of Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärk.
It has been acquired by the Municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate deal.
There are seven buildings in the area that are in a state of disrepair, and the municipality will be demolishing six of them by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth Belgian Grand Prix this year.
He's fifth in the world.
Bottas is a native of Nastalan and lived in Villähtee during his childhood.
He now lives in England, but he visits Nastola whenever he's free from formula.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth hostels.
I mean , design ideas are coming , but I don 't think they 're for the poor .
It's presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York.
The people who test Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the people on the field, but Marcus Giron, an amateur and one of the top college players, also wears one.
He says the shirt helps him monitor his own progress and regulate his recovery.
The shirt is woven with silver sensors that transmit information to the muzzle on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rate, stress and steps.
The central unit of the muzzle is removed before the shirt is put in the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact time for the shirt's launch, nor has it even hinted at its price, reports Tech Times.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company investing in smartwear.
Athos, California, has introduced a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, respiration, and muscle function.
The clothes cost $100 each, and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $200.
The same thing happened with the Red Orbit.
A clever way to save on textbooks
With college tuition costs in America for many students exceeding $1,000, Matt Schroeder, soon to enter his second year of college, came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system whereby students in later years would lend their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them on the spot.
"My math book would normally have cost $180, but I paid $10 for the whole semester plus a sandwich", says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university's board of trustees, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly turning to online shopping and creative approaches such as Schroeder's.
More and more students are renting textbooks, which they can use for the entire semester and for a substantially lower price than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which runs more than 250 campus bookstores, book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry statistics reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented books during the spring, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online shops
Online bookstores can get you a new book for only a third of what it would cost at a campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler has a suggested retail price of nearly $290, but the book is available at the specialty book store Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good choice if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn out appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" is available as a used book from Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old senior at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business" from the Amazon.com website for only $0.42.
If it was a new book, it would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use past editions in the course.
Sometimes the new edition's reforms are not essential to the teaching.
In this case, the old printing press can be found for only a fraction of the price that a new one would cost.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
If you take good care of the textbooks, remember to return them and do not need them after the course, you should consider renting them.
By renting, you can save over 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, the cost of renting a calculus book for the whole semester is about $20.
Learn the rules of the renting company, such as notes, the use of a highlighter and the payment of expenses for wear.
If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be more than the purchase price.
E-books and similar electronic publications
E-books instead of paper books may also be considered.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the owner is paid for the e-book's use, for example to bookstores such as Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg is offering a six-month e-book of Calculus for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books on science and technology can be very expensive.
It's worth comparing different vendors, no matter which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine at the law school, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of a book, since it helps to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, Gault says, make sure the book is in stock.
He learned this the hard way.
The shipment of the book he had purchased was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy the book at full price from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legionnaire Theatre is 20 years old
The theatre was founded in 1994 to fight unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
The event is open to anyone who wants to do performing art.
It organises free-oriented activities for the longterm unemployed aged 17-35.
The shows often take a stand on society.
In recent years, it has featured such works as the depressant Depression Moderata, I Am Me!, humorous narratives of narcissism, and classic adaptations.
Believes that every human being can change their own life.
Almost twice as many people died in fires compared to last year
This year, fires have killed almost twice as many people as last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Central Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
Last year at this time, 31 people died in fires.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
The worst year for deaths by fire, according to the organization's fire death statistics, was in 2009, when 64 people died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in residential buildings.
There have been 17 fires in single-family houses, 21 in detached houses and seven in row houses and other subdivisions.
Spek is like doubling the fire safety in your home.
At least, according to Spek, we should make sure all the home fire alarms are working.
In addition, everyone should check that the extinguishing devices are easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed exit from all areas of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they may use when alone in the home.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protesters opposed to the NATO summit in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Newport's city centre for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what is called a "counter-summit".
Stephen Fairclough was monitoring the events over the weekend and talking to the protesters who had arrived from as far away as Belgium.
The youths were airlifted out of Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were pulled to safety after spending the night trapped in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a walk after noon on Sunday in the Govetts Leap for Blackheath.
Family members worried about the youths who had not returned home, and they called the police at 8:00 p.m.
A search party of local police and volunteers were sent out to look for the youths, and the pair were found at about 11:00 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
She had injured her knee, and he had fallen and hit his head.
The officers spent the night with the couple, and they were pulled to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and they were in stable condition.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to the Ukrainian air force, the paratroopers have been fighting fiercely with Russian tanks on the field.
A military spokesman said the enemy's artillery fire was so accurate that it was likely Russian professional soldiers fired the shots.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol boat that was hit by gunfire yesterday in the sea off the southeastern coast of Ukraine sank this morning, the Border Guard said.
Eight sailors have been rescued and two are still missing.
Border patrol wasn't sure where the shots were fired from.
Yesterday, the separatists announced on social media that they had shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia will not invade Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that Ukrainian troops should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and Etch-y-chia should lead to an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
The EU is also seeking to strengthen its relations with the countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
First we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
The EU should also be able to draw conclusions from the actions of its partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets will be flooded in Malmo and Copenhagen on Sunday as torrential rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic, and buried cars beneath the water.
Authorities estimated Sunday that the flood may continue to subside, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
Heavy rain caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no advance warning was given.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist with the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the storm that affected the area was very local.
The rain front looks narrow and steady.
No wonder it's been so hard to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to show their feelings towards the Socialist President in difficulty, whose new government has failed to win the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves the respect of all of us, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stand by him", Valls said, and he deserved the applause.
In a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour workweek alone, despite the controversial suggestion earlier this week by the new finance minister, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work with the government in a joint committee.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused a rift by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who had different views and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, slammed the socialists' continuing disagreement, saying she did not believe the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty it was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even a summer.
"The new government will not last until autumn or winter", Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve the parliament and was confident of his party's electoral victory in the snap elections and would be ready to lead the party himself.
The ruling party in France suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the list key in the May EU elections.
According to a poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party may break up into several competing factions before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Paris, warned that the French would soon lose patience unless the new socialist government could improve the economy and bring unemployment to record levels.
'There is a small chance of success, but the public must realise quickly that change is happening,' he warned.
Otherwise, it could get worse.
The Finnish presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkolan and meteorologist Pekka Pouda were badly disappointed in the recorded part of the program.
Tomorrow Finland posted a funny video on their Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Huomenta Suomen commercial spoof from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go completely to waste.
Alm-Siira gets confused when she tries to say the word budgetary deficit, and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their heads time after time.
And these heroes should be allowed to live tomorrow, according to the Huomenta Finland Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo office of the newspaper, came third in the 1972 series of portraits.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In May 1971, a meeting of the Socialist International was held in the House of the Building Masters in Helsinki's Fredrikskina Street.
The meeting was attended by many heads of state and the security was overwhelming.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we had ample time for five minutes of filming.
I took this picture from about four, five meters.
The light and the background were in place.
I knew right away that I had succeeded this time.
You can see from Meir's expression that Middle Eastern leaders have had a difficult time in the past.
In those days, you competed with photographs of famous people or events.
It's great that you can now do it with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the photo of Lasse Virén falling from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Claim: Aarnio's investigation has already cost more than five million euros
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Narcotics Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 years of human resources.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki said in his thesis on computer science for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki argues that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining information technology systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Mr Rajamäe, modern technology allows for multiple uses of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information to be collected to solve a crime is an electronic evidence file that automatically fills the chain of evidence, and at the same time allows for a comprehensive legality check.
The claim will be reviewed on Saturday.
The 1999 concept of vegetarianism was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and poultry feeds part of a vegetarian diet"
The picture of a special advertisement on the wall of the Women's March school in Purkala caused a buzz on social media, according to Yle on its website.
You vegetarians!
The school lunch menu includes fish and chicken.
Only when there's meat on the menu, we make a vegetarian alternative!
So says a forgotten 15-year-old memo on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image that has been circulating on social media has prompted people to send the municipality of Pirkkalan a disgusted response.
The head of the food and cleaning service, Arja Vaarma, tells Yelle that the note on the wall is not correct and should have been removed long ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there was a time when this was a concept that was discussed in the course of time with the health care system.
Each student will receive the meal he or she desires, he tells Yelle.
Today, in Pirkkalan schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or healthcare professional.
Vaarma justifies the decision to Yale by saying that the youngsters' experimentation with vegetarianism may leave them malnourished and the lack of meat or chicken may surprise the students' parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3 billion contract with Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise line, is in talks to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, according to people with close ties to the matter.
The acquisition of Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would bring Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and wealthy customers into the hands of the company as it continued to compete with the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say that information on a possible deal could be released as early as this week, though it is also possible that the negotiations will not yield results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be released because the negotiations are not in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and a representative of Apollo declined to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise Line, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with itineraries covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its sales increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it had a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates the Oceania and Regent brands, with a total of eight cruise ships, and a map covering Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, up six percent from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India's middle classes.
Companies compete to be the first choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
The first issue of shares in the United States stock market was registered by Prestige Cruises in January 2014.
Apollo has owned a majority stake in the company since its 2007 sale, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current configuration in 2000 following its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the cruise company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay, and the entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting's stake in the company was 28%, Apollo's 20% and TPG Capital LP's stake of 8% as of the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have a combined 82% share of North American cruise capacity, according to the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of its shares.
The city of Tampere is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia is asking the city to support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, director of the Animal Action Centre, who is preparing a thesis for the University of Tampere, the period of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end soon.
In recent years, fortunately, there has been a growing awareness around the world that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is not sustainable from an animal welfare and ethical point of view.
I hope that this view will also be adopted in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a matter of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to the judge, the death of the dolphin confirms the requirements for the dolphinarium's sub-series.
The death of the visitor is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of the Snake River.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the power to adopt a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment from pollution.
"The return of dolphins to their original habitat was not possible for the dolphin, but hopefully the remaining dolphins living in Särkänniem will have time to experience life beyond their inactive concrete pool", says Mr Tuomivaara.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to ban all wild animal species in circuses in the forthcoming complete revision of the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support this claim, the director of Animalia, Tuomivaara, is joining the demonstration for dolphins on September 1st.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki is organising a public demonstration to protest against the opening of the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for use by dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the region's "separate statehood", Russian news sources reported.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine should become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population of the region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The demand of Putin for the government of Khininov to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the newly proclaimed Novorossia independence, which would allow it to turn towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state-run Channel 1 television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military's efforts to retake the separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently dubbed the region Novorossiya, New Russia  a term reminiscent of the glorious days before the Great Russian Revolution.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
'We must immediately start broad negotiations, not just on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-east Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there,' he said.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to a broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in an attempt to allay fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
The EU is also committed to supporting the development of the region and to supporting the implementation of the EU's strategic partnership with the countries of the region.
The EU is also calling for the EU to take action to prevent the spread of the virus, and to make the EU more aware of the risks of the virus.
The interim note by the Kremlin spokesman, which was intended to correct a 'misinterpretation' of Putin's comments, emphasised that the Russian administration is treating the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently than it does Crimea, effectively annexing a region whose population of 2 million people is predominantly ethnic Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the regions are not ethnically Russian and because pre-conflict opinion polls showed that the majority of the population supported remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give local governments in Ukraine the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin a de facto power in the area that Russia annexes to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main naval base, as well as commercial shipping ports and historic coastal sites.
The area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia also contains mines, factories and metallurgical plants producing products vital to the Russian military.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislature  after the new elections  consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of the regions of Ukraine that are separate from the core region of Ukraine in terms of their own economy and status of the territories.
His vision of independence, however, seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and enraged by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further inroads last week after Russian tanks and troops entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the capture of the town of Novoazovsk by Russian-backed separatists is the beginning of a larger drive to seize the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel strengthening the city of Mariupol, a port city of half a million people known for its steel production, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow strip of land that leads to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke in Brussels on Saturday to European Union leaders, asking for more action to prevent future Russian abuses in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach the point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
There are thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take direct action decisions; the leaders proposed the drafting of additional sanctions to be put in place in case the Ukrainian crisis re-emerges in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored regiments and 1,000 soldiers moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the beleaguered separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by Russia in Ilovaisk were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening goal for Milan was scored by Japanese striker Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the match.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was the first to take the shot, followed by Jeremy Menez on a penalty kick.
Lazio also got a hard-fought late-game goal from his own goalkeeper, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez defended Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez has signed for Milan this season from Real Madrid.
Former Milan forward Inzaghi's coaching debut at the San Siro was only half-way through.
The match was reported to have attracted a crowd of 39,000 spectators.
Australian public figures and Gabi Grecko in the middle of a nude-screen-scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has revealed that he's been stunned by the possibility that hackers may have stolen his fiancée and nude photos of Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecco.
The entertainment industry has been in a state of turmoil since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted online in the wake of a massive celebrity photo-hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have in his possession a total of 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of the Hunger Games, as well as other superstars, such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Also, Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecco from Melbourne are also believed to have been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting.
All personal communications and photographs should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and shared.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly called the comments on the website "shameful" and said the victims "feel humiliated".
Hackers are believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her previous boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two of Palmer in topless at the pool.
Palmer's film credits include the film Love and Honor with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch star Browning declined to comment on the hacked images from last night.
Lawrence's representative told TMZ that the video is a blatant invasion of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hackers in his tweet: "Posting stolen cell phone photos is no different than selling stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like it was on home soil and won a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan base.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not the red-white of Poland, but the blue-white of Finland.
According to STT, almost 2000 Finnish fans attended the final at the Spodek Arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
That's how big an impact the fans had on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already 0-2 down in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle shot from six points behind.
Cuba had already led 16-10, but after that the Finns got the hang of it.
