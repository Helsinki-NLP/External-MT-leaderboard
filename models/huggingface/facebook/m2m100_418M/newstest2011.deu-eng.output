The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the “conditory”.
The new councillors of the capital from the lines of the CSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has a little “discovered” members of the new Council from the CSSD as they dominate the notorious slang that has become inhabited in recent years, in which today’s coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the completed era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is a list of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in relation to which these new terms somewhat fall in the dark.
At least they say that.
Who is Voldemort?
“No knowledge.”
“I’m rather a newbie in Prague politics,” said Lukáš Kaucký, the new Council of Culture, to the test of the “Paten Dictionary”.
But the counselor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also responded in a similar way.
For example, the word “golf”.
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I use from time to time."
“I don’t like much of the serpent.”
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editor picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrat.
The Social Democrats should define the terms “Voldemort”, “Great Prague Gulf Hole”, “Go to the Conditorium”, “Stiernacken”, “Fraud of the Capital” and “Lost”.
Three Praga councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future chief of the Praga school - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth counselor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
“I don’t care about these things and I don’t judge about how citizen Democrats talk to each other.”
“It is important for me how we understand each other within our programmes,” he said.
As already stated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have acknowledged in the list mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is talking about it.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing, and the only term he correctly developed during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole."
“This is the Tunnel Blanka,” says Kaucký, adding to security, “but I know that rather from the newspaper.”
He said, “I’m going to have a language course.”
The “golf hole” will then be correctly described not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by Council of Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as the Tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where this figure is to be found and thus what it means "to go into the coat".
“I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business,” Plachý is quite close to the mystery solution when you know that it is the headquarters of Janoušek companies.
But in accordance with Březina, he claims to have generated this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
To judge the test participants, it seems that there is actually no similarly embodimented elephant among the Social Democrats.
“I’ve also asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s really nothing like that with us.”
“We call ourselves at the name, sometimes we also use shortcuts or top names,” says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský – from his party fellow salopp called “Hulda”.
“In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that way,” Karel Březina tells us his top name.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made attention to himself before the elections through machities in the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Top names are so the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in internal party language use.
Hulínský allegedly doesn't like it if you call him "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another top name of the Prague president.
His title "Doctor of Gummiknupel-Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and released a brochure
Women painted as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the elderly generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women "will be" to the witch, she is strictly isolated so that she can't become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are very rarely affected by this fate.”
"So young and healthy women keep this saved as they help in work and give birth to children," a sister describes the situation that takes care of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in the west African state's capital, Burkina Faso, in a special home.
The local government has now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason he issued a brochure intended to stop the “heksy persecution.”
But the matter has a hake.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” the newspaper “derStandard” pointed to the dilemma of written education.
But witnessing the witch is going and going in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they overwhelmed them with oil and just burned them.
The incident was by the BBC server.
However, the murders claimed that the case would have only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is flammed, which is used for ritual salts.
And that is, after the group tried to “extract a bad spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here, regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Freshers of human souls are a danger sooner than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to disrupt the witch hunt, the Gambian president has mixed the president himself properly last year.
“President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his grandmother, as these allegedly had a part of their death and will now try to kill the president himself through black magic.”
"He called on Shaman from nearby Guinea to help who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's body guard, violently kidnapped women and men from the Gambia villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a report.
In the farm, the insecrated people were forced to drink an absode from plants with hallucinogenic effect, but that also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the residence in the farm.
Only due to international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released.
A rental of Bakala: He is heating in the oven - still paying higher rental
An elderly prohibited man is just leaving the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently carrying out a prison sentence.
All three were just raised in the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of a monthly rental of 3,500 crowns, the son will pay 4100 crowns for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category next year.
"And there is not even flowing hot water in the apartment and heating you have to in a simple coal oven," he ticked angry with the finger on the son's new rental contract, to whom he has a power to sign.
"But what - I signed," he explains half voting and half resigning.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "inappropriate and immoral", advises the rentalers simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they are commemorating to publish an instructions on how to act against such contracts.
But the man only wings off.
“One says this, the other that,” he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is thus becoming the great “deregulation laboratory”.
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose renters do not yet pay market rental.
Actually.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG hall in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and is already nine in the morning on Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and there is a call device.
"Rental 2011", so a special keyboard lighted on the touch screen.
Shortly typed and the device is already pushing out a number number.
We have hardly discharged the number "157" and already picks it on the big display on the roof of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you’re on the turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rental, but the turmoil in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the coverings with the new rental contracts will fill most rentalers of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailbox.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rental in the customer center is open since November 18.
"The action goes a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch replied after a moment of hesitation when the "client" emerged as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former mining houses are a brisant topic.
Before the elections, the deputy deputy president of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD had addressed this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“For twenty years I want a new ground from them.”
“They couldn’t change the toilet glasses,” the first-mentioned man said.
So far, according to the employees, mainly retirees are on the switch to convince themselves whether they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The benefit of a half-reduced February rental will also come to the other tenants who sign the new rental contract until 15 December.
Until now, however, the "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all other than overloaded by demands.
“From yesterday’s 360 customers, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were due to here,” the switchers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall tables where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
“There’s no one going before the court,” says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the customer center, at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (chronos) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
The employees are uncertain.
“Let’s see.”
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she says to consider.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, rental increases are an economic need.
"The existing amount of rent is not enough even to maintain the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the negligence of the housing fund criticized by the abandoned rents is, in the opinion of the housing owners, the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the housing in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the leases taken, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-scale LCD display on the roof in front of the polster seals in Havířov's waiting room, a few red lighting information continues to emerge.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means no more than CZK 7.50 per square meter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rental rate increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the rise of extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG argues.
For 2600 apartments, the rental will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not push the rent to the high, but will gradually take place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes itself another commitment: all the revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the houses, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heat pollution.
But the priority is to benefit those who sign the rental agreements.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini garden here, with everything that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing place on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available for Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose workshops a whole series of renowned Brünner buildings came from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini garden.
In wise forecast, because most of its 90 employees (in) are in the baby boom age and the company is based on the idea that the designer architects will return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work short, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of its social program.
Construction engineers are so easier to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hole.
The minigarten is an original idea of the employees (in) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to earn funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mining garden is funded through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment were achieved and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the extinction of the funds (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the minicind garden for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the application processing.
The children are cared for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can be visited by children without age limitations, although most of them are over three years old.
And since it’s a mini-kind garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children to each other.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company's hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini garden is still comparable to the pre-education framework program.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, in addition they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time and thus get rid of the stress when delayed picking the children out of a remote kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employer relationships.
In this way, Arch.Design joined the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when hiring new employees, family-friendly, and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. look at Gaudi's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric axis, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are moulded fish.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the household inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes received the top name "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, cracks and mosaics, the shapes reminding facades and everywhere soft lines, all of these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreaming lines, dark colors and textures that remind nature and living beings.
Only with a more detailed look at it is noticed that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole facade seems even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting increases the brightness of the colors even more.
The same swing lines and dried shapes dominate the interior of the house as well.
Wave-like-shaped wood copies the window frame, paddles, cartridges of doors, yeah even look locks and leaves.
The house Batlló in the Eixample neighborhood on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the collapse of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudís for an unusual and even cheaper rebuilding.
The house of rent Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its rollboard that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner emerged and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, many other painters and artists also worked with the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house received its organic forms from the residents due to the top name "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other figurative elements also symbolize forgotten religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system for the time with ventilation channels and typical stones.
Something bizarre suggests her 45-degree inclination already.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations of that time, and was not allowed to interfere with them.
Before the construction began, though he received the corresponding construction permission from the city, the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so disappointed with the result two years later when completed that they demanded repair.
The councillors also confronted, among other things, that the building, with its piles, even entered the public custody.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary—only fifteen days after the request of the city district in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted a request for approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house—and it was immediately given to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company salon, in the 3rd floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The floor was packed to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the saloon doors and so a larger society could speak comfortably, without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received by Gaudís rebuilding in addition to a new facade a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glassed cakes, with which the interior courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly acceptable business, the visits were continued, and they were also extended to other common and the roof floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the building monument, however, is not a paper steel, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirees, groups and owners of tourist guidelines get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to know the real atmosphere of the house with its drack walls should try to close friendship with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedroom? women have different desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and roast make the good bed out.
However, these must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, size, health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Similarly important is the interior in which mattress and roast must be subordinated.
A typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suitable as they take a lot longer to "will be warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be returned regularly.
Indeed, if they do not have enough dehumidification channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, humidity is imposed: therefore it is not excluded that it forms under the foam.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will hardly be able to get used to a low mattresses with a hard surface.
“Wohl all the ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep right here.”
“For their scattered shoulders, arms and heads, they just need a soft layer of Visco shade (Memory Foam – a form memory polymer).”
"I recommend this, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in polster furniture.
That’s why many ice hockey players, but also other customers, have been concerned about these mattresses with Visco shame (Memory Foam).
“Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico.”
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the advantages of the Visco shame.
This “miracle” actually works very easily.
The shell optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it slides right on the warm body.
There is no pressure anywhere, in the night you don’t turn around as after a heavy struggle.
You just sleep much better.
The viskoelastic shell also provides protection against decubitus (wundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the foot soils, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are up to 180 cm large need a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm sleep bread, which is 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
Comfort as well as for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following foust rule applies to the ideal bed width: "When you lie on the back, there should still be enough space for the lightly wiped arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of polster and room replacement, who has been dedicated for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomy of furniture and has presented this topic in specialty schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs his own roast and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains but to mount the roast in different heights and this has long been not possible with any bed frame.
Sham mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape and the fine polster.
“There is no way to feel the feathers with the hand or when putting in,” Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special roast type.
Full-polled beds with a mattress and underground like combined Siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and stumbled seed).
This is why professionals refuse advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Everything has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the merchants: with mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not worry about the hygiene of washable, removable grids, yet it is recommended to use a mattress storage that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though today mattresses are generally made with round round closure, so after opening you get two halves (medially important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often assumes the unfair struggle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Go out with it!
Or at least for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation locks (if no ones are already in it) and use mattresses with feeder skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket foeder and fine polster.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substance.
For non-sustainable latten roses with 14 to 18 shells (lame) are suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for roses with a larger number of latten, i.e. from 28 and more shells, with lordose support in the linen wire area and the possibility of regulating the latten hardness.
Adjustable lamelline roses do not include mattresses with feather skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic layout.
In addition to the setting of the steep of the folders, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fixation of the foil leaves, which allows it to push the foil leaves or even to swing so that they allow the sleeper's shoulder to be punctual.
It is important for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "man mattress".
Also to the ladies is thought - they are given these soft zones in the hole.
For the most demanding customers are pointelastic wing feeder systems (Lattoflex) or roste with pointelastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion feeder.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) headbags for the right mattress and the right roast, most of the benefits are lost again.
Also here is a fist rule: the headache should support the head, its heads should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulders muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm-sized coat looks like the Scandinavians, for example.
In the side position, the headset should balance the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder outloading zone in the roast or the soft zone in the mattress).
Our modern mattresses have something common with the former (filled with hue) strohs.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixture.
In mattresses, the new magic word is called “Bio”.
Instead of oil raw materials, more and more natural oils are used to produce polyurethane deposits - for example, ricinus and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
“Bio is called in mattresses, their core is made of materials of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural ingredients are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also use micro capsules that spread fresh forest or lavendel smell when you sleep.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
While in men, a "cold" plant extract from peanut leaves is used so that the mattress can absorb heat and cool the body, the peanut for women has a "heating" effect.
Red pepper shots extract stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Matras made of calcium stone (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more respiratory than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the different stains (hardness) of coal trees and visco trees, multi-zone mattresses are formed that know exactly where the head, heads and arms are located.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have to pay 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT as they are considered medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was awarded this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and on the roast is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with the visco shame memory hidden for CZK 11,990.
The second one is available for free.
It was the material tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic sputum with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the starts.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in a cold environment it is fixed again.
Thus, it fits perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic spiders are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot polsters, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products, for example.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to have the children under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents consider monitoring them through GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for searching for cars, can actually accommodate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as recently in the trace-free disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box, but soon it may not be larger than an armband watch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and horror and so keep them looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a violation of their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spy, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS locations on the Czech market.
“I acknowledge that there may be a case of abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone’s pocket without he knowing it, but we had not yet such a case.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, it's easy to get rid of it.
Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
“From the beginning, the phones raised great expectations from the parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new monitoring devices,” Bočková said.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In planned kidnapping, the kidnappers almost always check whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed.”
“Today is the phone.”
“If such monitoring devices find wider use, they would also look for them, as their sale would be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, police criminals are always a step ahead,” the psychologist says.
However, it suggests that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
“In more expensive devices, even a inclination knife is integrated, that is, if you fall down and stay unmoved, the device immediately sends an alert with the position indication,” says Mr. Čech.
According to him, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem with the current locations is that it’s either about devices in strawberries size, similar to attachments, or about smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, therefore, we test in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks.
“This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Of he notices that only after a certain time, what gives the police a timeline," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - to armbands or attachments, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle layout.
So to combine from location function using the GPS system (as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many firewalls that you could turn around the whole of the Czech Republic to keep you but only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of firearms, which will be burned with explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of firearms to the army camps.
It is already calming to know that the armed forces have survived for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the firearm - two, but no more than four years.
The army purchased the firewall from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for lipic 40 million crowns.
In his justification for the purchase of this enormous amount of firearms, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km firearms annually.
According to the research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, this statement shows that the entire army should be completing an extremely intense pyrotechnical training every year – from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries of the PUTS.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only this can justify the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometers of firewalls halfway.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But also, these armed reserves would be enough for more than ten years.
But if yet the old rule of experts is that to train each new professional soldier two meters of fire is completely sufficient, then by these new purchases – even in the light of the increased need of the pioneer and special units – the army has created a calming reserve for the already mentioned 225 years.
At the same time, soldiers of the fast-income brigade recently complained to the Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no patron for hand-fire weapons anymore, so shooting exercises are severely limited due to the lack of resources.
Not to mention the shortage.
“I don’t even understand why they buy such a lot of firearms from us.”
But that’s ultimately your decision, you’ll already know what you need.”
“For us, the army is a good customer, which we like to encounter as traders,” says STV Group’s sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of firewalls by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year duration of the firearm and police and army pyrotechnics of just two years.
“In perfect storage, the four mentioned years are probably possible,” says one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, so as a soldier not to be criticized by the army.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not useless, but they cost more money.
Another argument by the Ministry of Defense is the quantity reduction for the 445 kilometers of fire.
“They cost us 60 percent less than the last year’s delivery of 244 kilometers,” said Pejšek’s spokesman.
The annual consumption of firewalls by the police pyrotechnicians, the Munition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, for a few years, is almost not exceeding 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the ammunition that they can consume before the duration of use expires.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, therefore, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable firewalls is open.
The Ministry of Defense has great problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its flight to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old firewalls, which they have bought today so "goodly".
So far I have the contacts I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning positioning in the “Small Entrepreneurs of the Year” competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last year’s competition “Little Entrepreneur of the Year” was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun loved traveling.
Only abroad he was aware that there was a lack of good accommodation opportunities at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he built a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a high school student in the sixth semester at that time, it was a brave task.
“The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something against it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
All the profits he immediately invested back in the house, which he then step by step transformed into a 54-bed pension.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year there was another high-quality hotel.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interests in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already signed up,” said the businessman number one of last year.
“A large share of this license sale to operate hotels had just the victory in the competition ‘Enterprise of the Year’, adds Mr. Pytloun recognizingly.
The victory brought him greater popularity, well, in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say that did really well,” he remembers.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don’t need to win, every vision is good.
He says that until today he is taking advantage of contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have arrived at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relationships until today."
The reputation associated with success, he believes, is also a bit off every one of his employees.
And he has the seventh.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is generally recognized.”
I really see this not only as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of us all.”
“My name is just a bit in the forefront,” says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had it in farm.
Victory suphoria was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its targets, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year was awarded by Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury then appreciated the efforts with which he stumbled from the small tool building in Česká Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this honor has encouraged not only me, but all my employees, and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition,” the previous year’s winner says.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And when then the state offered to his father Karel Žďárský for compensation for the property captured by the Communists a small workshop, he did not hesitate for a long time, leaving his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and founded with a few of his father's companions a own company for the manufacture of plastic wheels.
Shortly later they began to focus on plant oil presses.
In 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic printing across Central Europe.
But only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization it has also entered the consciousness of non-publicity.
“Not only that our customers now perceive the brand farmet much more intensely, our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, adding greater value,” says Karel Žďárský.
But last year was not only a sign of victory.
The award was based on the company’s economic outcomes in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for selling tools.
The crisis, which at that time even less shocked citizens, but, just reached its peak – many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation as well.”
“The revenue dropped by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take departure,” says Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation in control and keep the company in the black numbers, even with fewer profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was unwilling to make distractions - in the investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international exhibitions and acquired main awards at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory – but in a quiet atmosphere,” Karel Žďárský says.
A opinion survey that refines with unthinkable regulations
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some unthinkable rules have already managed to make out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year’s opinion survey “Absurdity of the Year” advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
More than one-third of non-full four thousand voting entrepreneurs chose this.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper removal from the trade register, even if the official had been able to obtain it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is changing.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer demand expenses from the trade register in the future when controlling social insurance providers,” said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to lift the unthinkable.
This is for the fourth time this year part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the Czech Economic Journal (HN) and enjoying increasing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder the business activity.
“As to the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading ranking in the world,” notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activities has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, with an eight-point worse position compared to the previous year.
The Absurdity Competition of the Year was announced for the first time a year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic foolishness from April to the end of September until the editing end of the competition.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration, after which the organizer of the competition is searching for seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have been filed.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from trade unions and journalists.
Among the nominated "finals" of the competition are, for example, the provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways must be paid or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare every two years.
The list of this year’s “Seven” is published on the pages of the competition.
The opening of the competition on the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of an event, in which regularly people of political and public life also participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic as well as Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the peak of the competition with the party.
“Where the state throws the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year that make the entrepreneurs today unnecessarily difficult their business,” said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unthinkable orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs' obligation to notify the business office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to drive with an exhibition station to an exhibition or a circle.
This obligation was repealed by a novel of the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which in 2007 received the second-largest number of votes – the obligation to report to the work office service trips of employees in a range of up to 30 days – was abolished by the law on them so-called “Green Card”.
All good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two persons wagons standing in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration obligation fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A news in this year’s fifth anniversary of the Competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impacts of your entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the auditor and guarantor of this competition, as well as the ‘Rebell of the Year’ competition.
For this year’s first anniversary of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and punishes enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrally in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here, for example, it is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the formation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory in Poděbrady also takes care of its disabled workers, which make up 70 percent of its employees, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Middle Boys"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company primarily purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment as low as possible,” says its CEO, Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit, from the Ústí nad Labem region, is based on the health of its employees and therefore it has achieved ergonomic seats and keyboards for all laptops, in addition it promotes homework with its employees and in corporate actions it uses cartering services offered by a domestic protected workshop.
“In addition, we support the “People in Need” Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the present Roma community,” says Ondřej Suchý, the company’s representative.
Not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader Region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
“We give our employees contributions to the nutrition, for the way of work, for the rise of their qualifications and for the holidays,” says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Myric-Schlesische Region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year were automatically registered all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the registration and sent it to the organizer not later than August 15.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation.
“When the representatives of the betting companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition ‘Responsible Company of the Year’, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified.”
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - arrested by police in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took over arrestations in recent days.
The media entrepreneur and real estate trader Luboš G. was kidnapped by the detectives.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a current public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition would reach a concrete interested party.
Luboš G. has paid half a million.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the delight of fraudulent facts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Prosecutor's Office of the "Právo" newspaper, with no further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released from the police.
The way in which he could manipulate public competition, can only be speculated in view of the extensive official information.
The spokeswoman for the ground fund Lubomír Černá pointed to Právo’s question in this regard, the police have actually made arrests in the Pilsner side site of the ground fund and this during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms. Černá, the public competition had the correct title "a request for the submission of claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the land law" and would take place in cases where several applicants indicate interest in the proposed land.
“These persons offer, within the framework of the request, a higher value of their reimbursement claims to be accompanied by the transfer than the exhausted land value.”
“In accordance with the proposed claims, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer,” the spokeswoman of the fund explains.
Luboš G. was obviously available information who had signed up to the invitation and as he himself was a legitimate person, since he had purchased a series of restitution claims, he offered a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat deforestation.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money at his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted by criminal law because he issued land in replacement restitutions which had already been placed on location decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired from the ground fund, for example, land that were intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the entry magistrals to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very conveniently with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land far.
At that time, the municipality had to give little to heavy heart, so that the construction project would not be threatened by the blocking of the land.
Housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
From January, households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water fees, and for remote heat and some places, rents will also grow.
From January, families will have to extract several hundred crowns a month more from their wallets than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a dozen more for water supplies, and some places the remote heat supplies are also expensive.
Only the electricity control costs the housing houses a few hundred crowns more per year.
The strong electricity prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, so the fault is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only be moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
There are also a few hundred more crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are getting more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heat are different from city to city.
Particularly major places are planning to increase prices.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for remote heat from January, more than 1000 crowns more per year for families in Liberec.
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Prague are threatened by 9 percent higher water and waste water fees, in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rental does not change, it is just 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the north, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water fees are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental prices are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rental regulation falls away.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the lease by one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this rental increase will be prosecuted by the company.
The regulated rental, which is still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, is expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drunk with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just works too slow
Furthermore, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky, you’ve stolen from your father’s bar.
These are the drinks, according to the enjoyment of which drunk Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This follows from the experience of doctors who face similar cases in the reception of the children’s departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department in the middle-boom clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to get the father a bottle out of the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," the chief physician explains.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová, gives her right.
“The most common is remote or rum.”
“This is the current trend in alcohol, especially in primary schools.”
“In general, it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home,” said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chief Doctor Pelikán, drunkers aged thirteen or fourteen have long been not an exceptional condition in hospital reception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from close and remote.
A girl had to be hospitalized four times.
"His career began at the age of 12, when she was first given with 3.5 promiles of alcohol in the blood and even in combination with "extase," the doctor described a severe case.
“She was in the exhibition hall in Holešovice on some dance party.”
“The interesting thing was that it wasn’t strange for her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” he wondered.
It is precisely the lack of parents’ interest or their incredible tolerance when confronting their own sprinks that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
A true dependence in the true sense of the word, according to experts, is not possible for children.
“Alcoholism is a long-term chronic addiction to alcohol and all related phenomena to be understood and this is not the case with these children.”
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is mostly characteristic,” explains Chief Pharma Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital spokeswoman, Ms. Jurinová, approximately forty drunk children were referred to the hospital’s child and youth medicine department by the middle of November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that made a hospital stay necessary enter the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after ambulance treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police, will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only once drop a bottle of snaps in the school bank, there are, according to Mr. Pelikán, three year-time amplitude, to which it is hundred percent assigned: Walpurgisnacht, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
“The latter for two reasons – either for sadness because of the bad testimony or for joy in the holidays.”
“In the Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the reception,” Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who has to fight only with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning afterwards, which arise from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be dissolved in the hospital with a fluid donating infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
“They are clearly better, because after the “hero” experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood, without hurting anywhere.”
“They’re just a bit confused about where they’re,” says Dr. Pelikán, who sometimes at least disturbs the patient’s good mood by telling them the costs they’ll cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come well and enjoy to a few thousand crowns.
“I used it again and again as an educational means when I directly pre-calculated the children during the visit, what costed their drunkeness and that it may happen that they have to work all the holidays over to make the money for one such fat,” Dr. Pelikán added.
According to him, however, the health care funds do not apply to return procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 first in foreign hand in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Defense Ministry has exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, have flown to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is sitting.
This is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only seen at maneuver or flight shows.
This is the flight-powered double-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159.
These are currently kept in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business – the company Omnipol – took over it last week.
When it will physically expedite the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the Defense Ministry spokesman said, is not yet known.
The introduced L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were excluded from long-term aircraft stored without further deposits and investments by the ministry’s resource.
“The double-seat L-159T1 was replaced in the current state and appearance,” Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to survive without two-sided fighter aircraft as the Ministry of Defense in May 2009 signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody on the rebuilding of four surplus L-159 to two-sided version.
A new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS has committed to deploying the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly and clearly indicates that the company EADS is a recipient of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to serve the training of pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the deceiver, the way he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was last year still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase at that time, but spoke directly to EADS.
At the time, the Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24; the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft may also have a judicial successor.
The European Commission prosecuted the Czech Ministry of Defense before the European Court of Justice. The reason? it would have to select the aircraft on the basis of a whole European tender and not by appeal of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the latter to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer finger than the ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer.
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixties,” said the study’s co-author, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, she added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK traced more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same likelihood of prostate cancer was considered as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and fingerfingers were equally long.
However, in men whose finger is longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and in men up to 60 percent by 87 percent.
The proportion of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are formed already in the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of gender hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer fingerprint.
Earlier research has shown that just testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that this study is flightly known to him, yet he does not consider the ratio between finger length and cancer risk to be "fullly proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the majority of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walks is mostly fast snow, the winter servants were on the axis all night in many places.
The highway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was stated by Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At Kilometre 91 a truck crashed, at Kilometre 93 two Lkws collided, in this accident there are wounded.
A few pkws are also on the road.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 highway toward Prague.
There are also two Lkws together.
The drivers should drive down at km 190 right behind Brno or over Brno and get up at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There are a kilometre-long stays.
Also on the D11 there was an accident and that was the same at the arrival to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the district of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely stuck.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trains run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplatz.
At 8 a.m. the Prague Crisis Tab collapses.
There are also problems on the rail and airport.
The Czech State Rail was forced to cancel seven speed trains due to snow rejection.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
The Ruzyně Airport is closed from Wednesday at 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Most of the streets in the south are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side streets are completely unbeatable, in the surrounding area of Brno there are staggering snowflakes and in the surrounding area of Blansko you are forced to use snowflakes on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three streets still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
There will also be the need to use snow freezers for snow removal.
When they will be resettled, it cannot be estimated so far.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the streets, which for natural purposes can only be scratched with inert streams, there is a snow cover of up to five centimeters thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, the most in the northern booms - set up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Schlesische Region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly ceases to snow.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon”.
For the first time, the U.S. troops have deployed a new “intelligent” weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban and move the relationship of forces to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precision cannon.
Their project parts are traced to the target by laser with a touch safety of just a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber shells, designed for this weapon and containing high-explosive explosives, operate practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the point, but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a protective grave.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel split rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat weapon is the first infantry weapon to make use of “intelligent” technologies.
“The soldier is basically doing so: he targets the target and sends a laser radius that determines the distance, so he gains a precise point of view, after which he corrects the height angle, then he just needs to push off.
“Let’s say you’ve measured 543 meters.”
“When one is pushed, the weapon is picked up and the shot is shot at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry said on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in Frankfurter district of Niederrad.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs for the group, which are already distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large rooms offices in Astro Park also better deal with the way the employees work.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a rental.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region toned joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurter’s economic dealer Markus Frank (CDU) said that a “Global Player” has been won again.
This is a “big location recognition.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important momentum for the downstream.
Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“We have, of course, offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the outbreak.
Now it is about avoiding a long gap in such prominent place.
“I hope the owner and owner of the building show themselves cooperative.”
Fujitsu’s house on the town square and the nearby “Little Verticals” were among the most controversial construction projects in Kurstadt with the remaining buildings on the Marienbader square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the railway station and the municipality, which brought criticism both due to the massive construction of the areas previously partly used as a parking place and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then associated with Siemens, took the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu’s Tokyo-based consumer is the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The headquarters in the Rhein-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, much more employees are Fujitsu however in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is established in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twentieth-year-old complex - the name depends on its star-shaped foundation - among other things, the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industry has its seat.
Amazon Blocking Server: Threats Against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It may be under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic records.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is staying in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search list, is expected to stay in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
“Wikileaks withdrawn from Amazon’s servers.”
“Free speech in the country of the free,” the disclosure activists shared through the short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle the high numbers of access to the documents when the secret diplomatic deposits were published.
On Twitter, Wikileaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees had engaged in investigations, CNN with reference to the Liebermans office.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee for Homeland Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian.
“I would have wanted Amazon to take this action earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks,” the Senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman urged the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries.
“Wikileaks’ illegal, immaculate and negligent action puts our national security at risk and threatens lives around the globe,” the Senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread the stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought to be raped by the Swedish authorities, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian man remains in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
“There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange was really afraid of his security, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations to be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "morted" and Obama could "use a drone."
There was a strike between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "smiling and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently announced spying requests to diplomats.
“I’m not sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website.”
The U.S. government now puts the protection of its databases on a comprehensive scale.
As a special commissioner, the Vice-Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Action, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that became necessary after the publication of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are in danger by the WikiLeaks publication.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” Foreign Affairs spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them when it is necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream is prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest entry and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient of the Ice Conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spaghetti, breaks it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don’t have to travel to Anzola dell’Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice does not go through the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest entry and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses about chocolate and practice in the home ice sheet.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, while others just dare on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and wants to do something of her own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Important is not only good taste, but also smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget at his training the hole of national and at all southern rebuilding: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romantic."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano wipes the basic ingredients milk, peanut butter, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns a hane on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
Instantly, the teacher is burned with questions: can I make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you release your own experimental desire?
Luciano warns not to be led by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only made of natural ingredients" may have still used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as garlic milk from the garbohne.
Of course, you can make ice even without a stabilizer, only then it needs to be sold within a day, otherwise it sacks in itself, and the customer kisses on loud glaciers.
Certain variations on the basic mass are permitted.
It will be more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pasta.
“The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of aromatized additives.”
“You just have to experiment.”
Or at the fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs becomes yellow cream and with cacao powder as the basis for all possible chocolate traits.
Now the participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano allows her to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hasellows - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also undergoing the fruit dishes.
More aromatic ingredients, more fruit pure – delicious is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss egg does not necessarily taste more nutritious if it contains more haselnuss.
The most popular Kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will correctly highlight the taste of a gelato, Luciano says.
Preparation is a calculation task: If peppers are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar proportion in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon is a extra portion of sugar required.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruits (wines thus measure the oechsle in the grape mouth).
Fortunately, tables make the computer easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously crumbled and cooled at minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small pans are not out.
The Brazilian Gustavo climbs himself and his colleagues from up to down with fruit purie as the overdimensional stable mixer leaves him out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time until something like that happens.”
Controller in the Twilight
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been undermined by the gene-plants experimenting industry.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA test rules for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interests, criticises Then.
The EFSA regulations are literally equivalent to the position papers of the Ilsi and thus deceive the industry’s manuscript, which is actually intended to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has a conflict of interest.
So a high-ranking EFSA manager has recently been without obligations or transitional time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta – and has changed the sides.
Also the Middle-deutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had recently revealed staff connections between the EU control authority and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Office as well as EU parliamentarians clearly heard.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
We use all reliable data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is said in a statement.
Experts working for EFSA do not demand that they do not have any contacts with the industry.
They should reveal them.
Kuiper starts his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics – among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental impacts is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does on the farm,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” asked Then accusingly.
This is the case with Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College of Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field as in the United States and in Europe.
There are therefore few researchers who do not interact with companies.
Critical studies for companies are usually not published.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Track of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday night he stood in front of Stuttgarter Railway Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was a demo.
It snows.
The story is well-known: In September the Baggers were stumbled and had begun to break down a large piece of the northern fleet.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: thousands of people demonstrated against the S21, the billion-strong deepening of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the fleet was in shrinking.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft gray stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a painter in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He saved some of the brokers.
“These stones are reliquies.”
“You must not disappear.”
He swears, "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and imaginative."
When he seated one, he smoked after cigarette qualm.
What he will do with the brokers, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trace of the Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition deposito of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old handles with old stones.
He bought all those who fell in the fall in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be scattered or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bed that was once a watchhouse.
Threatened and threatened, he tells when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the remains of the northern fleet from the breakdown entrepreneur.
But he talked with the S-21 enemy for days.
And he told them that he could not do anything for the disappearance.
And if this happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones would be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilograms weighing quaders, a piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As memories, but some also in the hope of being able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rings, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, land gardeners, housing builders.
They had come from everywhere and had taken away what the luggage room and attachments were able to carry.
The Stuttgarter Stones of Anstoß have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in limits of herbal beets.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
“It would not be the political component.”
He climbs into his land car, making a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura he studied and broke down, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
and stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he is the largest antique dealer in the Republic.
He brakes.
In the snow there are artistic sand stones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marien Bridge,” he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, it shrinks.
“My favorite stone.”
The way goes up through the forest.
It shows on a crowd: red sandstone, former part of the Karlsruher Railway Station.
and further.
“Beautiful travertine.”
Once the Quader belonged to the Tribune of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, Red Granite from the Dom of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks how the stones were formerly handwrapped and moved with simple bottlenecks and oak wheels, he becomes very afraid.
“It would be a scandal if something like this would be done.”
He has not become rich, he has not become rocky.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, in addition, they have settled up in the forest stone metts, a sculptor, a sculptor, a glass blush and a garden maker.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual processor.
He will soon go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high potential
Reger Andrang on the Buffet.
16 students are enthusiastic about salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they will, together with VW developers, simplify their expertise on the car of the future – and all the way to get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now going into close struggle and put, like VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as soon as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to shake out the exceptional talents in practical projects and bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the automotive corporations wrap around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber barks and maps with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: “The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can simultaneously meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who will come into question as a staff."
Such cooperations, so Selle, are not unusual.
The new thing is that the students are so offensive.
"And otherwise the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the new graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
But they have to appreciate themselves and especially look for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering jobs remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering failure will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and consultancy company KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the talent hunt.
It organizes overwhelming recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern cutting hunt in which participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will send the company through the United States next year.
In addition, participants can see the KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who can participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flies to the United States.
When crawling and stepping around the high potential at the universities, the shields according to Dykta are increasingly bigger.
“We want to get rid of the mass with the race.”
“Only a simple sail tower was too little for us.”
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to go up.
"We have been in contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
“Some are shortly ahead of their completion and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bowling at the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic at professional meetings.
“We are trying to reach graduates on specialties.”
“Ethwa on the Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager at Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the youth problem.
Currently there are 35 jobs listed on the company’s website.
“It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is the contact through the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
“The professors give clues that you can practice with us or write your diploma.”
Expensive advertising is not required by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"A large company can often not offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money has no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good rising opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment, and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
The staff manager Stübe hopes of the placement also pluspoints among the job seekers.
“I think applicants look especially after external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He recommends more authenticity to his customers.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as a employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry yargon, the internal Employer branding means employer branding within their own employment.
“Fate employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would all alone advertise to friends and acquaintances for their employer.
“It’s like a game with bands,” warriors say.
Obama stops oil savings
Near the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil deposits in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington, and thus its previous plans are finally revoked.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new boards are still prohibited.
This was by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is intended to be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the boar platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new burns in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the oil disaster in the Gulf has not been cleared to date.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions of demands.
An investigation committee on behalf of Obama is scheduled to present its results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had repealed the shutdown imposed after the explosion.
After that, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new boar projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to avoid a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which has been revoked after numerous corruption charges, is undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close profitable tax slopes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of subsidies in the Gulf would be significantly lower due to stricter regulations than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting company BDO - even before the burn ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further - facilitating growth.
Ogoniland is burned.
The water in the rivers is oil-brain, it smells like at the gas station: Billions of liters of raw oil has destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogon Island.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t worry,” the eco-activist calms the journalists, “you’ll still get enough oil in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to lighten a boyfriend watering into the water with the slices surrounding him: in the rain-colored water glow, the scene looks almost beautiful.
That under the surface brown raw oil defects are not seen.
Previously, she has temporarily gathered garnels here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, a lot of raw oil came out of a broken pipeline into the enormous moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to run for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: the Ogon Island, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst damaged regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrovensumps passed by the rivers, the whole extent of destruction becomes visible.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat turns up brown brush, whoever puts his hand into the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black lakrit stalls from the ground, sadly leaving isolated palms hanging their wheels.
Birds, as they are otherwise common in humid areas, are searched in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, the ancient paradise, which smells like a gas station, expands spictic tranquillity.
“What happens here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari dark: “We live in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a fighting field for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe entered, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to suspend its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland: While from the entire delta region of the three-size Switzerland with more than 5,000 bear sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, more than two million fases of black gold are pumped daily, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the group’s situation is too instable.
Every a few hundred meters stellar shapes like bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the barbecues too harsh.
They are up to 50 years old, most corrosed to the mark.
More and more, such a bear head breaks apart, says Akpobari, and then a constant current of raw oil throws into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters are flown into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: year by year the amount of oil, as it dropped into the sea before Alaska during the accident of the Super Tank “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago – one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be discussed.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil waste for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see blurry head and lean pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposes significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than it is usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner warned the group in 2008 that the rate of defects on the lines is "a many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-smalled workshop under an empty sky, from the mangroves shapes emerge: they are split naked and oil-smalled to the neck.
Among one of the many caves, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily spread out on the ground, a fire flies: an illegal small refinery.
In the façade, the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, says Michael, the head of the group.
Bensin first infiltrates through the pipes into the starttop, later drops out at the end of the pipeline and eventually diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four tanks of diesel a 300 liters a day: “This brings us 34,000 Naira” – about $22.
The Delta inhabitants benefit from the chronic fuel deficiency in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel at about 40 euros per liter can still be suspended by illegal cookers: for their raw materials they get for free.
It comes from the “bunkerers” that spread the pipeline through Ogon Island: in this way, experts say, the country is losing at least 16 million liters of raw oil a day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a small portion of the provisionally interimly stored raw material is unlawfully processed: the portion of the lion is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking soldiers, in tanks and scattered on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the displacement of the population or the lacking way of production, activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as penetrators and had not so thoroughly destroyed the base of the fishermen’s life, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal from the group can be questioned: “Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are better.”
Michael is nervous.
“The highest time you’re going to disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
“Every minute the soldiers can come.”
If the illegal oil producers are captured by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful smell money.
Also the soldiers mainly from the country order want – like all Nigerians – to benefit from the raw material.
“This condemned thing has brought our country to the dog in every way,” says Akpobari.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error when investigating a carred machine, which could lead to a "disastrophic drive failure".
The Qantas airline will now appeal the engine manufacturer.
In early November, the passengers of the Qantas airbus were obviously much more lucky than it was known before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has in its investigations detected a major safety problem in the drives of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: with an oil slurry connection, it could cause fatigue rises and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to a “disastrophic power failure”.
Rolls-Royce’s engines in 20 A380 aircraft were affected.
The Qantas airbus had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts were solved and the load areas were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made a oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the interruption, up to 40 engines must be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out further security tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines affected.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the drive for a A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-layer aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Snowfall leads to traffic chaos
Germany is all in white: overnight, snow has fallen almost throughout the country.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: With ice temperatures, almost the whole republic is adjusted to Thursday in the night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east there are some 15 centimeters thick snowboards.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is very limited.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent operation, but the constantly new snow was not completed.
Furthermore, heavily flooded over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting storm floods on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water stages of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, the snow rejection on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia, in Saxony Switzerland therefore the alarm level was violet – the highest level ever.
Particularly there fell 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds caused denials.
There were several trucks and cars staying there during the night.
Also in Sachsen-Anhalt the police large disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stunning traffic and stays.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to German Railway, there are significant disorders in Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thüringen and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the trails, crushed trees on the trails or destroyed top lines and wheels are the main problems.
In Saxony, the distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg was stopped.
In Saalfeld, a ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool cover, food and drinks in the train.
Snow flooded over the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight crashes.
In Munich, a spokesman of the flight information center has already some cancellations.
According to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been canceled.
The winter service is in permanent operation.
Although there are few passengers on the airport, there are still about 400 field beds available for them.
There were many accidents on the streets on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in collision with a train on a railway transition in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: also here a truck was captured on a railway transition because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning.
Also, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crashed in her car on a smooth street near Aschaffenburg.
A good news, however, the meteorologists have: although the snow will still be mild and powderful and therefore it will flourish already in light floors.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is covered by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Storm
According to a newspaper report, the Money House is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could be invested in the property.
It was the first time the Deutsche Bank made its headquarters beautiful: the Twin Storms in the Frankfurt Bank District have been modernized; now the banks were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial corporation is apparently trying to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes with a call to a spokesman.
The reason for the planned sale was not stated by the spokesman.
“We’re always looking at whether it’s more meaningful to own or sell properties and then recover,” he said.
Thus, Germany’s largest credit institution will resume its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double-tower by the investors of a home fund for 272 million euros in mid-2007 and then thoroughly renovated it.
The energy reconstruction caused the data after approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" according to the newspaper to approximately 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are again sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands of regrets for the dead
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the dispersed miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be saved because the security situation in the accident is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were destroyed under days.
A probe had been dropped in the disaster, but had not found any traces of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for security reasons.
After the second massive detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the couples.
The bodies have not been saved so far.
Families and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the light of the sun in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They are silent for two minutes.
In honor of the mountains, 29 tables were placed with helmets, lamps and the names of the companions.
Pictures and personal objects, including clothes and surf bretters, also found their place here.
In front of the country’s government buildings, the flags hurt half.
New Zealand has hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" will come back to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the memorial ceremony.
“But they’ve never come home.”
He cannot finish with the death of his son unless he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the families of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial ceremony.
The first explosion, which took place on November 19th, also destroyed miners of British and South African origin.
The rescue workers began to erase a fire inside a coal mountain building on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are pulled out, it will begin to drop the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warriors!
Is it suitable for art cinema?
Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, his fighter epic “Walhalla Rising” re-elocates the old gender boundaries.
What audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he directed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Vikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) releases himself from his peiners and with almost supernatural forces arrange his enemy – it sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabiate methods of murder and his enemies are once throwing the silence out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other characters can also be put into one or two sentences, or a few terrible death scripts.
Otherwise, it will be silent and swallowed in Scotland's terribly beautiful hill landscape, which offers the hill to the Wikinger world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adults who are interested in existentialism and very quiet cameras.
Good if a film has multiple target groups, sad only if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has since his wild and styled drug trial "Pusher" been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality available to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be distracted by the brain mass and the patterns around.
The action fans die not later than when, for free-interpretable reasons, one eye with a troop of violent Christian missionaries passes through the ship to Jerusalem and catches an eternity in flood and cloud before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
Therefore, it is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie lease in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a shame especially because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a strict action, it’s all the atmosphere, a film-made fever.
There is no entrance for the viewers.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his ice images and the dark Trance-like soundtrack, he slowly tightened his neck, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that struck him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonde boy, who stands to one eye loyally, preserves himself something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of the unanimous hero, whose motives will never be explained, but for enemies and temporary allies, he will some time become a warrior from hell, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means devastation, but only for those who are devastated.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and surprise.
It is an experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take a position — it still leaves controls.
In the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the coast of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents by the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korea’s help in the Quader, hidden in a valley that leaves out of the electricity.
According to a letter from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Service (CIA) from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also operated under the name of the nearby village El-Kibar, would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the fifth century is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unclean satellite images.
Through computer animation, she looked into where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor was stopped shortly before the operation, it was said, but has not yet been filled with firewalls.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it’s hardly more known than at the time, and the mystery has become much greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but he saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a “disclosed reactor” even if they consider the CIA presentation “plausible”.
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how safe he is to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered in the summer only lapidar, the IAEA has “a lot of material to ask questions.”
The shuttle of the alleged "unused military building" was quickly removed by the Syrians and thoroughly planned the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
Furthermore, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which were likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these records are not available on the market because the unknown customer - Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always stated that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The Uranus comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, IAEA stated that it was unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it prohibits the controller a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubbishes of the broken building.
Israel is still silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has gone out of its outcome since June 2008 and “is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the Authority,” as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges – finally, a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Closure Treaty stands in the area that the IAEA is watching over.
As the key to progress in the intelligence, the IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are intended to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and other than that still exist.
The inspectors have not yet revealed what facilities they are, what functions they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah by the IAEA, and are derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these places and found on satellite images a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base – just for this reason, Syria refuses the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the U.S. to spread military facilities.
For the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the Quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and back.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or recycling; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are all plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether the trees, which could have valuable traces, were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the shoot is left.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, records from the orbit show that Syria carried out landwork on the three suspicious sites and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
Additionally, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets—only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Were Western diplomats in Vienna even a year ago, the reactor has been destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, for example U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has for a few months brought the so-called special inspections into the game, one of the strongest means the Vienna Nuclear Headquarters has to carry out controls.
The IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has already talked about "a option for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the IAEA Governorate, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything else than pressing on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thinks, “What if they find nothing at the end?”
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed directory in the summer, there are trouble.
The script was written by her, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but it’s enough for trouble.
The rumor continues that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some of the planned films in Sarajevo were soon moved to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to Jolie about the UN refugee aid agency UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now - Jolie is the ambassador of the UN refugee aid agency.
She is not diplomatic – she has offered women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps have not been there, and Joli's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended the UN refugee aid to release Jolie as ambassador, according to the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read its script, has, after a few times, issued a scripting permit for Sarajevo – it’s not clear why Jolie did not yet come.
The young author says, she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a vote to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
There is a second synopsis of the film on the internet, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are thrown into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What does sound significantly different than the variant "the victims of rape fall into torture slave."
That Joli's film actually begins before the war - so much is sure.
The pressure on her, according to Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now you may only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the net.
Nothing as away here.
This evening, it is finally going back for the Iranians.
No traces of fraud.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans sweep for joy with crushing loud music, they stumble with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Cork bows because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.

Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this crazy drinking game and the retardant computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to entertain himself, getting rid of the burning question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
“I have a mild feeling there,” he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had ruck, suck her desire job as an event manager, a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three sisters have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like on the island in many families.
100,000 Iranians are likely to leave the country soon, experts from the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin predict.
In 2015, they are expected to have 200,000 migrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
Indeed, the forecast is that there is an emigration wave comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is uncertainty, especially for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it was only going up until now.
Employment loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in excess.
Three out of ten men and women are now unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are readers’ letters of young migrants who complain: “Everything goes down in Ireland.”
“There should be a rebellion against politicians and banks – but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation.”
“The latter, please make the light out.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future rising because the government is doing only eye-washing and no longer offers young people future prospects.
“They reduce the minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes how her commillions hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to take the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the “WorkingAbroadExpo”, a show that offers a round service on work abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader,” the manager says.
On his website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for a half year.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, you are just lifting up a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's home is rarely seen now, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a bit mad,” he says when he first climbs over the threshold of his house after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m more than never.”
He laughs a bit shy and goes through cool spaces.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with carried forths, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for €380,000 - 100% credit funded.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, thinks of hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes down, I can start again."
The building engineer doesn’t like the wrath that he often hears right now.
“No one has to hunger – our situation is far from as dramatic as in previous times here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while, that’s not the worst thing that can happen – maybe we just feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
“Seven years later he was there again and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with life elsewhere.
He has a few years of work in London and why should it not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it might be going to a well-being party.
“Don’t get too many emotions,” he says and drinks a great drink of his beer.
“Well, that sounds scary.”
“Let’s rather call it a walk party, very gentle, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, just like the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The results included the Latinobarometer survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in the region.
Two facts are in the eye in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by approximately 6% annually since 2002, the number of Democrats increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse last year, such a trend is noticeable.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they would be satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. This is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% their government. Both values are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America only experienced a short recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America’s report of this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, from country to country there are severe mood differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was stronger and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in the crime in their country than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. but compared to 38% last year, the values have decreased and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the surveyed over-regional stated that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela retained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private enterprises.
Brazil, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year) has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the United States as the most influential country, with this role taking over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
A Electoral Clash
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the voter assistants who were hurrying to help the affected country, far beyond.
Overwhelmed election trials, multiple votes, electoral scenes in the stone, destroyed elections and intimidations were just part of the problems.
The elections were opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless due to the January earthquake, struggled around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top leaders, demanded the cancellation of the election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, said the election "as quite good in many matters."
According to a cautious statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, no matter how serious they may be, do not necessarily make the process invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is allegedly committed to the unknown dissident president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There is hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent from the voters, declares the voter as the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in cells, a low election participation was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were blocked by lack of organization to vote.
Shortly before the election began, approximately 250,000 documents needed for the election were not yet issued.
There is a lot on the game.
The donors see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
The Haitians are the same.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%.
However, whether you will help this to a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who led the economic policy even after his wife's election, often made budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income according to their own goodwill.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further crashes.
Some regime critics from the rows of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (when one parliamentary fell in the face of another and others indicated the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the budget for 2011.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The budget for 2010 is now also valid for the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money according to her own goodwill.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is, for example, at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and trade unions’ wage requirements – draw the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shocked by economic crises, declared growth and poverty fighting as its main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scandalized the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population Index INDEC, which subsequently scattered the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a moderate way?
He called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to officials, salary increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentine agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth shift due to a major devaluation in 2002.
Per this is why Cristina Fernández wants Argentina to join the rest of the world financially again.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández appears to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club donors, to whom he owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner had always rejected an IMF review, as usual elsewhere.
But last month the Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index.
It is unknown whether after the end of her term, Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which is largely enough from the Church.
If the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that was given to them will be removed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she will silently and silently repeat many political decisions of her husband.
Weak Applause for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly getting closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold of its great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all voters, took up to vote for the five districts of the mayor and the mayor. This is considered a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the building of broken business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of the relations with the mainland.
Ma has passed the examination, but only short.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) has three of the five mayor, it has not received a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, received 50% of the votes, the SMEs received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for me.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city trees together with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the common events in Taiwan such as truck convois with crawlers, flags-slowing mass carriers, and only strangely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the SMEs, held a speech on a SMEs candidate in the evening of the election.
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a spectator was killed.
Curiously, it is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill Lia or involve a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Importantly, the relations with the continent were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
This is why the SMEs do not like to put their relations with the government in Beijing in the forefront.
But this time the DPP also avoids to exaggerate the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on its part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support their China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a dealer to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants a political integration. but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has been reinvented.
Two years ago she was heavily weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was sitting in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he promised absolute independence.
But under the Tais rule, a new generation of politicians developed and the DPP is struggling for the votes of the workers and youth.
Tsai found great consent as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create an idea shield as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this predicts unprecedented discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that his party is offering a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas a quick approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to rely on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmatic Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP becomes difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The SMEs will have to undergo their own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad despite the rapid economic growth; the SMEs candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the increasing gap between poor and rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reform his cabinet as well as the local institutions.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only restrictedly supports a re-approximation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there’s no return anymore.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you appear on the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the Year.
Given the fact that since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. But it meets the Grammy rules that a artist may have issued no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
And with her vibrant voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin music, you can calmly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings is closest.
Additionally, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors of Iyers include Moody 4B by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and Positootly by the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favourite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where otherwise more likely to be found albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well worthwhile attention in the big group category. He thus deals against the Billy Child's Emsemble with his Chamber Jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Awards include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra work, with three votes, will be introduced.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles".This piece was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and re-edited in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, chorus to solo recordings.
In the classical producers category, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
The opera category included mountains "Lulu from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonicists under the leadership of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dormans "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous north African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orch for a recording of the works of Strawinsky with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental solists were nominated the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the geiger Julia Fischer and the harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocalists this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, the sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
The mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous promise of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critics called on the project to promote both terrorism and traffic shock.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local rules and will become an aesthetic viewpoint.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bahá’u’lláh, and many others,” said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
“As an American I am proud of it.”
“It shows that justice runs.”
“There are few opponents,” he added.
“They are very loud.”
“There are wonderful people in this valley.”
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the building of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides distributed quite uniformly, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion was continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” he said.
“It’s another planet of apes, and the Statue of Freedom lies dead in the sand.”
“America is the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
Its municipality with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they have rented together with a manufacturer of water filter facilities.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is planned to build on the approximately 17,500 m2 land on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterial species that can live, among other things, by Arsen, opens new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they think it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
“This body has two possibilities.”
“It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow.”
“This makes it something very special, though it’s almost a kind of ‘strange’ form of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital – carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“There’s a question of what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report at Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
"The discovery shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we think are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not coincidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, they assumed that microbes that are exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of the arsen is based primarily on the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus.”
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other.”
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. it enters our biochemical system, where it smells almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers set the bacterium GFAJ-1 out of an increasing concentration of arsenic. it fit and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can survive even in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, that’s why science has assumed that early forms of life have used it.
“This gives reason to assume that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth Age,” Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons research team, said.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday as unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in the night before a Bellflower Motel 6, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“You are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore did not provide any accurate information about where the dogs were found or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigations are still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
“We are pursuing a few traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district housing in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the car and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old puppy, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were not injured, according to government officials.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, which Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog view to dog view.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their car before their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer wave, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with them into their motel room.
The deep-flies Akitas and Corgis remained in the car because it was cooler there.
They left the window a wide spalt open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.
Peek promised that everyone who could give a reference to the Corgis will receive a finder salary. The animals were implanted microchips to identify.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a Finder salary will be paid.
The lion brills again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got a green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “prepared” creditors plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and open the way to the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. competition law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually enter into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million loan to finance the new MGM production.
Currently, a consortium of the investment bank, which contributes $75 million itself, leads the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company’s leadership that fought with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who was known for his work at Krispy Cream Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted a few offerers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started ahead when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially overcome the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the company’s management, will receive a $4 million success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only released one film and made an annual plan of seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are scheduled to be produced by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of MGM’s loans, tried to fuse the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gamers can throw a considerable hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic spring seals or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toys dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
This year the technology games are more efficient and at the same time costs a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, finds a broader offer.
There are increasingly more buttons-operated toys coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as seafood, who sing a note when you press on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, through multiple pressing you can play a song.
Many sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you’ve started to press, you can’t stop.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchanges like 'Simon says', and thanks to its new sharnier feet with wheel blocking, it masteres the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. however, their parents complain about the lack of noise control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole crowd of questionnaires, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better-knowner with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t like to trust your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained in it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first big review of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card board, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is still a Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not bigger than a strawberries chain and have their own LED screen.
The game is about gathering the blocks into words before time passes. It is great for an improvised literature competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online puppy in the Club Penguin, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two additional parts.
This can be wheel shoes or a puffle-stafftier.
The latest head cell-operated micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The boiler moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It’s fun to send him through a foolish garden.
And he holds a lot.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting milder
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin crossed a city square, checked his nervous subjects and gave orders with military authority and suppressed voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, afraid and neglected for their arbitrary races and their hang to violence - to impress the viewers.
“Ready to stand!”
“Look straight!”
“Take them,” he flirted, “what beautiful girls are!”
Four girls, hardly grew up to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pair of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four ordinary sheets were perfectly sitting on the hair held with a blue-white strip.
“For me, they look average,” Mr. Tang notes slightly.
“Models are beautiful.”
Several governments have already tried to pop up the image of Chinese city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-star: 2009 reports showed that 50 officials surrounded a car that was not properly placed and watched the operator until it packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the city police stripes. they have been selected specifically due to their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the brutal police a soft, female aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson could hardly improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
It is right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the city laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei killed a spectator when he filmed them with his cell phone as they shot down a protest against a waste warehouse.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be stolen without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai water melon trader suffered brain injury after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows trained officials in China during an attack on road traders.
“Chengguan makes the government worried,” China Daily said last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough cleaning.”
Skeptics consider that the current approach is not sufficient.
When the district searched for eight women on an advertisement in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women would have real tasks or should only serve as an optical disconnection.
Probably both.
According to job ads, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic faces".
They should be over average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with achieving the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too stressful for women over 25.
“The most important thing is her image,” an unnamed district official said at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
“Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, faces, etc.”
Then comes temperament and “internal qualities”.
“Women’s Chengguan are like flowers,” he said, adding, “but beyond, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City Administration, does not wish to compell this description,
However, he acknowledged that in China, measurements in job ads for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to equal faces.
Whether this is equal to good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"We can't, unfortunately, use lame or bulk here," Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple backs and a well shaped mouth.
She didn’t feel sexistic that so much attention was paid to her appearance.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the grapes, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to your information, they do not regret the short attitude as they have more ambitious career plans than just scratching traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip is dealt with about twelve road dealers trying to sell as many bread and tobacco products as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are hunted.
“Mr Wang, please disappear here.”
“We’ve told you this so many times,” Mr. Xu explains to a trader who had fled by foot while temporarily leaving his nuts fixed on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than challenging.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales business.
“Everything is routine.”
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
You can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male bosses.
This is intended to protect them from public hostilities that officials are often exposed to in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, rallyed after the rumor went on, Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were shot down or burned into fire.
Xindu has been saved from such violent eruptions so far.
Unrest is not to be excluded.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials sponsored this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a roof.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaid in contrary to the rules on the custody instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers opened the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, left behind, turning his white name shell to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbal.”
“But sometimes even physically,” says Mr. Li naughty.
“Most of the time people start with the dispute.”
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations brought against him after his case with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the heavest lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which brought land-wide signs and put his career a damper, he was considered the Republican's possible presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns Office announced, he was "heavily pleased" with the judgment after the one-year investigation.
The ethical committee of the Senate could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to the statement of Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been stopped and that there are no further accusations in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not talk about the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. they think there was sufficient evidence that Ensign ignored the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, made profitable orders to buy his silence about a case with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure master during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton’s work. According to the documents and hearing, he took over for them after the arrest of Hampton’s lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently still in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take on lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, was deepened against the so-called ban of rotating lobby.
According to the published indications, “this seems to be an agreement and a violation of the turn-door statutes,” says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients who stand in the government’s vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said the Ministry seems very cautious in receiving political accusations after a variety of defeats that were traced by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to let the accusation against former senator Ted Stevens fall for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "is obviously horrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
“This in principle means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, the main advocate of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the next day he was informed that the ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had collaborated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, “acts in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more in detail the legal arguments he had submitted to the prosecutors.
“I’m not happy to go into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much to say: we believe we’ve made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend the investigations for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, following a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to Mr. Ensign’s help.
A e-mail from December 2008 proves that after the company transferred Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing’s head of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was “attacking” to the Interior Ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign had also met with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the transport minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this case was first brought to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranking.
After he had not been noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and stop his investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them drove into the crawls in the court room.
In a minute, they sent on Twitter their reports of cruel witnesses.
At the end, according to the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bed-to-bed children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully prosecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already submitted requests to the court, indicating the reasons for a appeal and which will be held by the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting of the process – also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has come to a “circus atmosphere” and a so widespread, ongoing penetration of disruptive details, so that the jury has been inadmissibly influenced by public disturbance.
This objection could cause the appeal courts to discuss whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the court.
"As I've experienced it during this process, I think it's really a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the court hall affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main advocate.
The chief judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, shortly rejected the requests by decision last week when he said the New Media would be "customly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court complaints have found that reporting famous cases makes doubt about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic 1966 judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States canceled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, and said in his judgment that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the court room" because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the game film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims that consider Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes out of the court, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in the processes that are prosecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that limiting an immediate communication out of the court room could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders, for example, also claim that Mr. Hayes could have already been prejudiced as Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel photos of the incident during the juror election.
Some of the jurors said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have met with hatred.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a jury who has been a prosecutor’s critic, and that he would have unlawfully pressed the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In an appeal they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of the Governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media would have continually regained the flames of emotions about the case.
“A day-to-day appearance of media writers, cameras and reporters outside the court,” the lawyers wrote, “was not seen before in New Haven and even across the country.”
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are more generic than reports that are slowly returned is a technical hostile view that reduces the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said the appeal courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer’s lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their objection they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting and made clear that the New Media requires new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of foolish words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out this week in Washington.
Is it the oem of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congress heads did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions will be made.
After all that is heard, it was not a courageous discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather a empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President’s deficit committee on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months leads to mutual respect, which hides the ideological gap that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to say it is a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase – in which one calls for a sign of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to consider the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has dominated over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the sound has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partial passions that die again.
And that’s good so.”
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session”, Republicans and Democrats hardly have a different choice than to find a solution.”
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it is temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise regarding the increased unemployment rates is expected, though only because the Republicans can’t afford that one believes the favourite tax cuts for the rich while they refuse to support the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, the optimism has risen that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Institution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consensus is more likely, even inevitable.
"After the things to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what’s going on from today to 2012, as a pre-combat, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the rise of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who served their education.
As concerned the Republican leaders may also be about that they play poker too high, they know they have to try to comply with their promises to reduce government spending and put out the health reform.
These lines are already clear in the first responses to the deficit committee’s recommendations, which include a tax reform and the rise of some taxes, the rise of the retirement age and the decrease of state expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the hardest jobs in Washington and have, according to their own estimates, so much pressed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan to an official recommendation and they are struggling to get even close to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the group, as in financial matters, at least today, there is little obstacle or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party collisions, when the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and healthcare system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of current elections, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a backgammon, as it has happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may actually be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than it was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a precursor for a much larger election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that will be shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separate from each other.
U.S. document portraits Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the “cleptocracy” and it gives part of the funds and protection funds it gathers to the Kremlin.
Both police and state security services are pressing high protection funds to keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate shops, but also from organized criminal bands.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority” – takes its part of the money that moves the leaders upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been cleansed.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption accusations over the years, and he has won numerous fraud against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television channel when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's mad, it's dirty, it's dirty."
An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the report of the ambassador, individual persons are mentioned, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government to the crime has led to some calling it ‘interrupted’ and come to the conclusion that the government acts more like a Cleptocrates than a government,” the memo said.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends to the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
“Luzhkov is in the top.”
“FSB, MVD and the militias are on the second stage.”
“First, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors are following at the lowest level.”
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report continues that the FSB is cashing money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, it is said, " explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
“Therefore, the protection from criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before.”
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don’t pay find their business closed very quickly – due to one or another prejudice.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with bags that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrates," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
“But he is part of this bureaucracy.”
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Over the country, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (the countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The disclosure of the Memo of the U.S. Embassy, which took place late after Moscow time, will surely cause misconduct within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the disclosure that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we't have expected this to happen with such a arrogance, with such a pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly enlightened, emphasized classroom with dirty and scattering walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the Killer", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge's capitulation against the government, long-term supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that first tells the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of former soldiers.
And in July, a community court of the UN and Cambodia sentenced for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the famous Tuol Sleng torture room, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicating their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of diseases, re-treatment or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to Thailand on the Cambodian border.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to swallow to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who did not give up, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
As their gentlemen did not protect them anymore, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crumbling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government positions because they placed their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
“These people have very little benefit from the capitulation,” said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime.”
“They grew up without any professional knowledge.”
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice maker.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
“Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat.”
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The court's task is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the strikes, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has little helped to mitigate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she told representatives of the Cambodia Documentation Center that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project in which thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun thrown long shadows on the dirty grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court would invite her, she would refuse to go, she said.
“Kambodscha lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war here.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Kambodscha has to buri a hole and buri the past,” he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Center said.
“Commoning with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved schoolbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an attachment to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they’re not sure how many people will be condemned by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains leads a road overwhelmed by strawbery and drawn with plastic waste to a rectangle of black rubber, covered with a roasty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone vendor on the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas' birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last holiday home, where she will throw a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agreed not to collect more armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign on the global security of nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the White Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a white-Russian research facility.
This provided the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about £500.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).”
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, chairman of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to safeguard all nuclear materials in four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it to anyone.”
“We use it solely for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the U.S. a few months ago when it expressed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first launch to remove the Uranus of Belarus in October was complicated because the material was slightly radiated, officials say.
It was charged in a special train that was more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and waste, officials say.
The second flight was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into white-Russian research with poorly enriched uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on the Global Risk Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-extended Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus plans to dissolve its camp by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tensioned for years, primarily due to Lukashenko’s harsh denial of human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
“Welcome the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central topic in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
No opposition from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections against the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as shown from a telegram of the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
It is added that former deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed “to prove that foreign aircraft that fly over Spain are properly monitored.”
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights abuse practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council’s report “hacked Zapatero away” and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections against the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed,” so they don’t be “unpreparedly surprised,” Aguirre reports by cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “will not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as they are in the hands of the judges.”
Prosecutor Vicente González, on his side, gave the message in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister on the CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any annoying or sensitive information,” the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the U.S. was more concerned about the “visible coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments,” Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly strongly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he gave his staff instructions to "evite flushing rhetoric comments to let the tension go away."
The ambassador also expressed concerns about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a sign that the government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will hit capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government,” he said.
The child murderer acknowledges that she has complained on the internet about the "mothersal" of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galic style"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name she leads from childhood, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least a girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstruct on the basis of witnesses from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman established a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was of him, but his ex never allowed him to do a DNA analysis.
Soon after that, she had a different relationship.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to look around on the labour market, the little man stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone at Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
“When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let what he wants.”
She later mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complained, “If he doesn’t like I leave the boy with my mother, I’ll take him off when I’m back.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine myself on the 20th for a job if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take with her first-born when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him again with someone except my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th of the month is dead.
“On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not.”
“On the one hand he’s with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day.”
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
“There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less spending for the girl.”
17th: Memories and complaints.
“A huge kiss from Caesar who asks me when you’re coming.”
"Alberto says he has sent me any videos to the email. you see, if he wants, he finds me, such a mist."
On the 30th, another one: "The boy is well, he goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there’s one: “He’s shooting money before me.”
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison lawyer".
“Terror a la gallega”
The last man who lived with her, a promised hunter, explains having conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t realize that everything happened because she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the provincial prison in Palma by the Center for Judges in Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the course of the incident, "and she had no intention to add to the Small Damage."
However, she had previously claimed to have drowned Caesar in the bathroom and stored his body in a bag.
Defence and Prosecutor's Office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and membership in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - advanced or not. Your expectations are more than positive, since the number of votes that this party gets in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC’s voting proportion and the bonding of the PP’s voters - should continue, PP’s analysts predict that in parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional members, while the CiU would win four (this now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (from 25) members.
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one member - currently it has three - while the ICV could hold its members or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar should be kept, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the wage to end the socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the city governments with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither gain a majority nor use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is no doubt that this party will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona, where it must obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP, however, an increase in its voting proportion in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's revival. there they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party could see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and strives to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven detained by the police officers of the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service Pakistan and the Nigerian formed the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Bombay attacks, which claimed 106 dead in 2008 - provided with passes.
The Spanish Interior Minister emphasizes that these investigations are of great importance, which goes so far that he assures that the “Operation Kampai” has weakened Al Qaeda’s counterfeit apparatus worldwide and “from its capacity to act.”
The researchers predict that during the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passes were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda is composed, so that their “fighters” could without punishment cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The covered cell is not the only of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have participated in the investigations. It is not to exclude that there will be similar attacks on the territory of the EU in the coming days as the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had been driven from Bangkok from the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network – part of which was destroyed in 2009 – stealed tourists passes in accordance with the requirements of the so-called “International Islamic Front”.
This means that the documents were issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In the investigation circles will be emphasized that so far no connection between the Catalan detainees and the Bombay assassination could be proven, although the author of the assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before the Catalan assassination, several thousand dollars were sent through a money transfer company, which were “invested” in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the “Command” which ended the lives of 106 people.
Police have captured extensive documentation.
PP calls for the withdrawal of tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present his conditions to support his post as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already made during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 members she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable.
The future allies that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections depends on a possible agreement with the PP. The talks that Mas currently holds with the rest of the party leaders, however, turn around Catalonia.
With regard to the party chairman of the PPC, it calls for that, to support the delegation, "all discussions concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque - and which the party chairman of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum will be put behind.
It is common for both political leaders that they want to weaken the established political apparatus of regional administration and eliminate the heritage and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's entry into office are discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The senior care house confirms that the deaths are not due to "fake measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they revealed what damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for during his work - had caused to the institution.
The head of the senior care house, Joan Sala, came up in conjunction with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability obliges us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a social loss of view because it did not detect the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé claimed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued murder since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the elderly care house - as he suspected that no doctor had personally investigated the deceased, but the formalities were addressed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denied this point around and stated that "the remaining measures could never have been the cause of the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the dispute there were no indications of negligent acts of a person other than the accused.”
The already baptized "death angel" stood before 11 murders and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later that he had murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different calmers.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the calming cocktail put the nurse in six of nine crimes committed to free the patients with the death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory trials will reveal whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them blaspheme, as he did, according to confession, to three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, the statements of the nurse are not given faith, not even in terms of the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to change his behavior suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the court.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our reaction wealth.”
Euro-Peripheral countries’ risks have increased dramatically and European banks’ shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can cheat and that the euro has hardly attributed points, which causes concerns.
The events of yesterday are typical of an unliquid market that recovers to the extent it collapses, however due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to withdraw our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB must make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of state debts because they are ineffective, as well as the termination of all exceptional timely liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarter-year tender with unlimited access to the quarter-end to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and to issue a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the exquisite reaction of the markets from yesterday will be rejected, and if we persistently insist that we will take our liquidity measures back, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, where the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets then collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets, according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt loss were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The amount is estimated to be about 10 000 million in the short term and possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures within the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval on its new budget on Tuesday, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate with regard to the 14th December summit of the heads of state and government, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same partitur together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented the action plan, which will be adopted by the Council on Friday.
Pensions reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as with the financial institutions, reduction of state deficit, liberalization, privatization and employment measures. measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldis Four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has risen by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year state debt that will benefit from the trichet effect. That’s why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debtability.
For Spain, asking for a aid plan would be a self-offering.
We would get liquidity that we don’t need. the Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed timely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar’s wife: “Now it is not only the being, but also the appearance.”
Only courage, we can do that.
The Chairman of the Board of Eulen, at the request of his children, hosts the associate assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not disappear.
David Álvarez, the founder of the corporate group, will appeal to the associate assembly of El Enebro, which will take place on the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolute null."
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new chapter in their dispute about the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services seems not willing to submit in his legal dispute to the control of the El Enebro bodies.
He was removed from the Board by five of his seven children who appointed themselves as members of the Board at the shareholders’ assembly of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as a complainant in the Trade Register.
The associate assembly of El Enebro, which was called by the judge of the Chamber of Commerce Court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new fourth blow in the shoot of the Álvarez family.
The call of the judge to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the call of the assembly.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a “desperated means of the applicants – his five children – to allow the 18th January Assembly to be recognized by means of legal expertise, fraudulent crafts and abuse,” the official spokesman said.
This argument is the basis for the later appeal of the Assembly to declare it as "absolutely null".
The same protagonists, in discreet silence, have already failed in June to call an assembly in court.
At El Enebro, the property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets, David Álvarez’ seven children control 100% of the capital.
In contrast, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to address the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this elected universe has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the Neuling, and despite his steadily rising turnover during the last seasons, at the final turn last November, all put on the Ferrari’s win by Fernando Alonso.
Without trying to lower the skills of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company brought to the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car runs.
This computer science program called PLM has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high precision instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is aimed before it is actually built to avoid errors and excess costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull Factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests can be designed and carried out.
Russwurm concludes that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stations, who were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in one season.
Today, the Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, with powerful computer facilities, they carry out analysis and any possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault declared responsible exclusively.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transmitted from the simulator’s virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this mad technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend for its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers away from London.
These are two buildings where visits – especially from journalists – are very limited.
Everything that happens is top secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink Manufacturer put in the services of his participation on the races, other protagonists are hidden, whose support is unprecedented and whose popularity is equal to zero.
The tech chief Steve Nevey emphasizes that five years ago it could be said that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the pilot’s contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers because they are “not predictable gladiators.”
In two years, HP will open 20 own shops with local distributors.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) launched its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first one of twenty stores with a range of 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agreed this initiative with the 16 existing multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president, Helena Herrero, named as an example the rebuilt store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group plans to set up 200 sales stations in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are located in Spain.
The first were launched last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia).
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new opening, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same.
The North American business group advises this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products for attention). in Europe all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it’s not a franchise system and pointed out that with the exclusive sales network it is intended to “optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small when purchasing and afterwards, yes even the packaging.”
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
A online service builds a connection to the technical center in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
“This system has been developed especially for small and small as well as private customers, as the big already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to ‘clean’ a million customers in three years
The executive member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. he believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially disrupts a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he predicts a breakdown of the interest rates that banks are trying to balance with increased fees and loans prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years – a still existing field.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without recourse to the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers – 700,000 if you pull out the customers that the bank will lose – this is the big challenge that this bank is facing because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers are more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. outerity, cost reduction. The challenges the bank faces with this will present it together with the annual accounting report.
Few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has led to all banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its four-year Optima guiding plan this year, which was initially planned for three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by a financial year.
The customers who will leave the deposits are the main goal of the bank.
At one breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a large scope".
The manager predicts that Spain will only come out of the crisis “lowly”.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he predicts that the war on passives – which punishes the interest margins – will run down, the risk additions that banks and spacecards have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be reimbursed to the price of loans as a compensation for declining profits.
“The Liquidity and Financing Themes are Structural and They Will Exercise Pressure on Loans.”
“We haven’t cut off the hunt, but the interest differences are very high,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase the interest difference (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also insisted that the banks are currently pursuing the slogan "to raise fees", but "in a framework characterized by competition".
Sabadell's guidelines are based on organic growth, even if the group, as usual, does not exclude corporate.
Not forgotten he assures that in Spain "greater companies are needed."
Everything will change next year,” he said.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently "enormously rising" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions are going to fall into red numbers.
He believes that FROB could replace the monetary market in the event of capital increases.
Having assured that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he rejected the argument of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be put around, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repair shops and thus catch the crisis.
CECA shuts off a second fusion wave of spacecards
CECA’s chief executive, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that there could be a fusion wave of the cash and emphasized the speed with which the industry will be restructuring.
When the concentration process of the Spanish deposits began, several deposits suffered not to participate in the first phase.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkass Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, said that this second round would not take place.
The inclusion of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather an adjustment.”
It may be that instead of seven, we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. they have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managers and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course set in previous times, not now, in the framework of business plans with Banco de España," he emphasized.
“The transition from 45 cash with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with each 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process.The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much greater than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement,” he said.
Olavarrieta said, “There would be a series of uninterrupted opinions about the slowness of the process, the misericordia and foolishness,” because “Banco de España warns us to conclude timely before the end of the year.”
CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and "maybe" around the world, adding that those who doubt this do "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation we have to "no worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and deposits that have passed through a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also reminded that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of time-working enterprises or the abolition of €426 aid for unemployed who do not receive unemployment, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, supports, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the responsible for the current crisis.
How do these processes be understood?
It should be assumed that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of re-defining the euro.
Germany adopts a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the preservation of the ancient traditions of a majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways to get out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark – although this now sounds more like Science Fiction – is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budget management; punishment of the countries that violate the provisions; possibly the settlement of payment of some countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The position of Germany is clear and has been characterized for a long time. therefore there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the dispute between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel painfully dismissed the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the EU agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time binding private borrowers to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it demanded the Irish crisis and all the following.
In the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that should not be transcended.
It tells everyone that – even if it is now necessary to take unpublished measures – from this date the old way the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency space in which the contrary countries will be severely punished, being forced to declare themselves unpaid, and in this case the private sector will have to take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to pursue a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, reducing consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and buildings with huge holes in the payment balance, as it was introduced by Spain in boom times, will simply not be adopted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not only about reducing the state deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will go more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line brought by Germany is there, and it doesn’t seem that something would change.
Among the possibilities taken into consideration is that we should not exclude that we should leave the eurozone full-stop with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to overcome a sanction.
The suspected exclusion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match of November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of tinting about whether it was a non-sport event or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the game end (his team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the required sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more frequently found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten, but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate on the present case goes back to the fact that a team of the football club of Real Madrid (who in his hymn shows glory and honor and in other occasions has punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behavior not explicitly prohibited by the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions represent a rule of law.
In this case, the damage caused to the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical impotence of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from attracting an unjustified benefit from the opposite.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or rule defeat, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the sanction with pleasure.
Another question is what kind of benefit the offenders pulled from the deliberately fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was not brought in a disadvantage or the benefits for the game played were reduced, as the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could at some point also disappear. in addition, the players with this procedure receive a sanction and go to the second card cycle, in which they disappear due to card increase with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear if it is really a benefit.
Finally, such practices are not against the sports spirit, which includes strategic decisions to make the best possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent the sanction (it would actually be a clear case of rule loss), they would rather choose when they will submit to that.
They met a strategic decision without escaping from a punishment or escaping from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulation environment is hidden, I think this is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemics arise as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-conclusions and because of the type of provoked regulation transfer.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer to the customer start for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar makes this year a lawn of reservations fall to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widespread. they do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also a group dinner in the pre-Christmas time that brings oxygen to the Barcelona hostel and recreational industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they set out a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the large mass: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
In order to make the accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of a lawn of reservations of dinner to two top gardens (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinner for budgetary reasons.
To not have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, the lowest prices are required, confirms the chairman of the guest board of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the roof association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
“People think about it a hundred times before they book.”
“They like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with whom, “providing quality at good prices with a good service,” he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in crisis times, which is why prices are the most demanded by 25 euros.
A survey in various central restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17 leads the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adjusted their menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, whichins 16 hostels in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We’ve made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste from €19.95 to €30,” he explains.
The AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, does not lose optimism after the revenue has flourished since the second quarter and the good, although on a few days focused prospects for the Christmas business are faced.
The company group sources point out that even the 18th will be a overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green springs blowing, which is why employees are invited again.
Fecasarm (with associations such as the bar, restaurant and recreational association of Barcelona) advocates the vice president, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations in total are quite "living" although the customers "output a maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration has not gone down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
WikiLeaks reveals confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department revealed by the WikiLeaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarificing and sophisticated details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security will not be strengthened, but, on the contrary, "rejected" and that the unstable Asian country will produce more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in case of a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by Pakistani ambassador Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the likely dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and the missile programs will no longer be seen by the United States, but also by Russia as an outward and reason to be cautious.
“Pakistan has to hire strictly trusted personnel to monitor nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American officials.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that the cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan in the field of nuclear dissemination is downward and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office, which describes communication with Pakistan as “frustrating”, explains: “There is often no transparency; on aid offers we will not receive any answers or they will be rejected.”
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit to the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clear” the responsible that “the Pakistani Army has stopped its silent support for terrorist groups.”
The Hunting of Wikileaks Chief
Obama has appointed a senior responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol has issued a red warning on the search for Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complex labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” about the “discovery and persecution” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
Additionally, the lawyer of WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens assured, “the police knew where and how they could get in touch with Mr Assange.”
The international police authority based in Lyon (French) issued the order on request of Sweden, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and discover Assange, "to temporarily arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organization’s statements, consider the red warning as a freedom for an arrest – which must be carried out by the national police – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
The proceedings disturbed Assange’s lawyers, who recently published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via a video conference.
They also remind that Assange requested the withdrawal from Sweden and received the corresponding approval from the prosecutor, compared to the stated Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin.
“It’s like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter accuses.
While the world is searching for him – and his mother from Australia is charged with her son’s innocence – Assange remains in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave a interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an undefined place. during the conversation he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violating international agreements signed by the United States, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "smiling and absurd".
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents from being revealed.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to draw less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators declare these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will lead the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to capture their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, the adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to reject his statement that Assange should be “morded”.
“Obama had to turn it into a target board and use an unmanned aircraft or something else.”
Who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever was who laid the information through the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and everything that is not an executation is too mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for the Carod Nearby Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to make a secret vote on his stay in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to go out for the tenth time of an internal turmoil in the rows after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the voters unoriented ERCs.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not sufficient to the nearby of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former streams.
That’s why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye wing, which would guarantee his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, he announced yesterday that more than 200 regional ERC council members could speak secret about his stay in office.
With voting cards, not with high hands.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penalty for the president, they could do so without fear of repressions.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division as well as that of submission under his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would not feel confirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby demands from the president more than just to provide the party with its position. an insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the top body of Congress.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board on an action plan from now to May.
For this purpose, they expect the Board of Directors to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be presented to the Council for voting on the 18th.
In return, Puigcercós will promise to postpone the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is the opinion that the "polyphony" damages stability and he seeks once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty washing behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació thought it was a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the forefront.
First, the “reorganization” of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from the Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally give up the principle of full assembly as a way of functioning.
In this way, he denies a reform of the Statute, which will enable the Congress to deal with elected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which already struggled in the last two congresses for how occupied.
In fact, at the 2008 meeting, the party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of full assembly on a congress to address the reform of the Statute.
This date is still out, as in the context of the internal rest of the last years, it was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sector, it could have come the time to re-establish this matter and end it forever.

Chinains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China said at the COP16, his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprints and it would retain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to eliminate carbon traces and transform its industry.
He concluded that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In contrast, he said that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutions building, and pilot program support.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contains the objectives regarding the reduction of gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he emphasized that in China the authorities of the federal states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to the goals of energy savings, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
In addition, he concluded that several multiannual plans have already been attacked or completed, both those that were funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been introduced over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project on provincial level for climate change, one for the exchange of traditional lamps through energy savings, and one for weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were much greater than would be generally accepted.
He showed that the emissions per capita of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons.
The energy activity has increased by twenty per cent in the last five years, and one further is expected to be done by 2020, he said.
Legally Excluding Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former chairman of the Panistic Party has the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN has the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right confessed to him.
In an interview that took place before the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as the Governor of the Federal State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that was made at the local level.
“This is an independent decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora.”
“Mr. Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Commission de Orden del Consejo Nacional through the complaint to make a decision by a competent authority,” he added.
On the other hand, he said it’s not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance of presidential candidates has never sat on the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, where his successor will be elected.
"This (a Alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiation table, at least not until now. it was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we don't scare our internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years.
“I’m completely uncharged and open, and I’d be proud to transfer the position of party chairman to each of the five.”
He predicted that the party's recovery recorded in the last 4th July elections will be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think of 2012."
“Now it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.”
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments that came from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. therefore, "many hopes and desires are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the demands."
When asked about the criticism of the PRI on President Felipe Calderón for his discourse within his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI supporters to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, if they started to defend them, they should finally come out of the shelter,” he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government expressions like those he could make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and even less a censorship.
Obama calls on Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge for the adoption of this law," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - the law to legalize and documented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge for the adoption of this law,” Obama tweeted.
His short message contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to enter into contact with their senators as the vote of the law is ongoing.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, it’s time to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except the expansion of tax cuts from the times of Bush and the government’s funding would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could impact the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republicans’ blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, President’s spokesman Robert Gibbs said, he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule for the rest of the projects could be set up.
“I think we still have a lot of time...”
“We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year.”
"I think we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law with which the initiative to legalize and documented students can be voted in the Senate from the coming Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the Law of American Dream would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who migrated to the United States when they were not ten years old while living in that country for the last five years and are registered in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need seventy votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should decide to turn the initiative back.
Among the most recruited Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they did not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
With literature put the finger in the wound
The second round of 'The Lust at the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story.
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? what is expected from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-speaking literature and at this occasion used the subtitles of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
“The finger in the wound... brings us into trouble,” the Argentine magazine sweetly spoke to the audience, consisting mainly of young people who gathered together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to contribute to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and later characterized the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what a "what" is, and goes from a doctor to a doctor, of which she does not receive any answer, but gives clues for the guide of her story.
She says to the infectologists, “Tolerance is not my strength, maybe it’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who stole her breath in the middle of the walk, and who explains that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytic reveals the mystery: “the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the narrow.”
The main character of the story sweeps ease and concludes that she "just learned from the wound that this is really open and does not exist."But she is convinced that the desire for the language and its falls blend.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a wonderful story, which he called ‘Love of Invention’, and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells about a famous wizard who touched the clouds, returned far travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and tells about America, the great novel that it didn't miss from the beginning to his own chronists, and he quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the overflow of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers) spotted the fake witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even came down the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasizes, “there are the crazy and liars who best imagine the things,” and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs, where fictional literature reaches the peak.
He actually calls this the ‘Cervantes tradition’.
“We have inherited from him to be what is told.”
When Mayra Montero was on track, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIl’s invitation to the round table “The Finger in the Wound” contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that her country - like all of Latin America - is the result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "heavore this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-living world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness go beyond dogmatism, and is forgotten that “there is a little yes behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial.”
“To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger in the wound and disturbing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-prepared ideas without nuances, and also disturbing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and called for a re-discovery of the meaning of writing.
Roman is fighting for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced up and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final match, two different styles are also faced by their respective coaches, and their confrontation marked by contradictions is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced up and abs in his career, but three times he has played decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentine has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has left a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive final games with the same team.
The Santist Stratege achieved the first final game as a coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when Del Morelia had the tricks in hand, with which he experienced a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to set a reversal again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went unresolved after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleven meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two chances to put his title, but ultimately three of his players failed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Devil's Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he doesn't want to be persecuted again from misfortune and get rid of the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break the statistics, that’s for a club, for my enthusiasm, that’s why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing,” he commented when asked about the lost final games.
The last game is still strongly in his memory, he assures he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the judge does not put the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line, the players are prepared too, because the last time we were two eleven meters already prepared to leave, and I believe that this is a lesson, until the game is over, there's no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by eleven meters shooting doesn’t worry him, because he confesses his players: “You never want to arrive at eleven meters shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there’s no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate provided us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it won’t come.”
It lies in Romanso’s power not to be just the second champion and to pay the glory the titles bring with.
The United States amends the rules for receiving a visa
The persons must present themselves to the service agencies for the visa application before their conversation at the Consulate; the costs will be shortened in this way.
On 10 January 2011, the procedures for the application for a visa in the U.S. Embassy and the Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation at the consulate at the visa application service agencies (ASC, the original letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall collect the applicant’s biometric data, which will be reviewed by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the visa processing is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the deadline agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is sent.
The applicant does only one payment that covers the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the countervalue is $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to conduct a conversation at the consulate, they just have to present themselves at the next ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service fee of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in the universe.
The National Aviation and Space Authority of the United States (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
During the press conference, NASA assured that it will “present a supervisory find for the search for alien life” which triggered speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in enemy environments that were so far considered uninhabited, human-like creatures could exist. The hypothesis was put on that these could transform into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their conditions of life improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. it lives there in an environment that has been considered to be too toxic for all possible forms of life as the lake is highly arsenic.
Considering this ability, the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere are increasing.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from what we know."
The Space Agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, on a press conference the actual scope of its funds.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who explores the possibility of life on Mars, and by the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Constitution on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entrance of the 'two-party system' into the chambers.
Before the introduction session to the 60th Legislative Period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo voted against the reform of the Ordinary Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two persons, the same number as the parties that controlled Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his position as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo said the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political front position with these reforms.
He concluded that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next few days to change the scheme; they were out of that political will and if they did not have it, they would be subordinated by both parties again, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
“To this point I come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we’re excluded from all decisions that don’t even consider taking into account the opinions of the others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be approved, he continued that the Congress, after it was monopolistic, is now to be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that a eternal two-party system should rule in Congress.”
“From the beginning, this group begins with five members and they talk to other colleagues and colleagues so they’re more,” the member of Convergencia said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT stated in reference to PAN and PRI that the Congress has now turned into a 'beut' for two.
“Before it was only one party, now they split it into two.”
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the MPs and grant them their place at the negotiation tables.
The five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiation table, because because of the reform, which was carried out and met by the others, we have left out and we are not agree with this reform.”
200,000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays a further cheque to the contested owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over somewhat more than 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued at a amount of 200.144,56 Peso with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of the use "Open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already provided that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier. it is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it is sold at exaggerated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe it and consequently the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There's nothing bought from her, it's just the debt paid, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be recovered.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25 the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that earlier, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they took checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist locations need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada trade union, reminded that on various occasions it was asked to care for the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new job opportunities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and walks would have had a negative impact as tourists come to sliding and see the disorder, after which they would turn back to the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t think about how much money you’re losing because otherwise they won’t do the construction work slowly and unplanned.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist collapse would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work by the city.
"The municipality must take on its responsibility and avoid that such thing happens again. how should it do that? Well, through a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the future," he explained.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city. because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be kept up, we inhabitants also have the right to a clean habitat. the city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
“There are other places that also look unmatched and unfinished,” he said, “e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán.”
“Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. it needs to be offered a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and tourist attractions constantly in shoot,” he added.
“These measures have not been given sufficient attention, and these kinds of incidents are just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it is to save the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and give a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought together with the city to Vordermann. to make the city clean, proper and attractive for tourism should be the priority.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and bring them to the inventory we promote for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the MPs should take the great responsibility to give an example for a better sinaloa that faces many challenges.
Mazatlán’s corporate industry calls for a decent parliament, free of agreements to push the parties and the government, since Sinaloa is relaxed and faces major problems.
It consists of seven political powers, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of PAN, three members of Partido Nueva Alianza, two members of PRD, one members of PT, one members of Convergencia and one members of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean work, feel commitment to society and the different social groups that are dependent on a responsible parliamentary work, and that the same patterns of partiality and paternalism will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Entrepreneurial Coordination Council CCE, proposed that the new members should take the great responsibility of giving an example for a better sinaloa that faces many challenges.
“We hope that the MPs truly exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is usual that they conclude agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby turning themselves into carnival competitions of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
He said they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to undermine the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy work and, above all, engage for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust to them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, says one of the great challenges the 40 people face is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new members to give the necessary importance in the state budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
“I’ve understood that it’s the ministry with the second least funds. this is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings currencies and investments to the country and stands in direct competition with the agricultural industry.”
To tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the Alcohol Act, which has not been renewed in previous legislation periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Puppies, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela desirably.
For the parents it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next three-kings day, because the budget is not more and not less than twelve people and a sheep.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel don’t give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. they live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
“Sometimes hard times are required because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I’m going to go to the street with the goats to sell,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a 'monster car' and for whose eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one-year-olds.
“(José Alfredo) told me, ‘I would like this monster so much,’ but I answered him, ‘Let us wait, boy’, because it was very expensive,’ Cayetana remembered sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. a pair of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign 'The Holy King is Seeking' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the collapse of a cannabis production and sales network around the ten household searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and various accusations are being filed.
The domestic investigations took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were to have served mainly the drug manufacturing.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered to be the main drawers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were expected to appear before the court building in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, its property for sale purposes, the complot and the service of crimes.
These household investigations were the result of a long investigation activity that lasted over a year.
“The information received from the public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests,” said M. Ruel.
About 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily traced.
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be intercepted after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I strongly reject this Charter.”
“I’m staying with a party that has placed your legs on your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session ended before the assembled members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law that allows to detain any person coming from a ship identified as to transport illegal immigrants for up to a year violates as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the block of Québécois, also pointed out that he was unable to support the bill as he turned against the false target audience.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we’ll wait for what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has wiped out the critics who demand their party did not behave stable enough toward the secret immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to implement by mediating another draft law, the C-35,” Chow said.
We do not advocate the Conservatives’ bill because it is seeking the fault among the refugees and holds children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“The Canadians tell the MPs that they don’t tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that they treat the country as a footprint.”
“They expect Canada to take harsh measures,” said Kenny’s response.
“The government has not announced any confidence vote regarding its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
One conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that every opposition member would immediately declare to his voters.
The new unity has no unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, existing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to demand the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, says this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
The metropolis has since 1870 had a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than just one surprised.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and a member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "the chest-covered rabbit" as well as "the right-covered solution" in terms of public security.
Minister Dutil had, on his part, addressed those who fear that the political power will have too much influence on the questioning, future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he pleased to confirm.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the chairman of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists to want to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
“The only way to form an investigative committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State College for the Training of High Administrative Officials).
In order to get out of this baggage, he proposes to Quebec to assign a special mandate to the financial audit, so that it can conduct the corresponding investigation of corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of examination control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the inspection control the same authority as Commissioners, which would also allow it to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the shelves of the Charest government.
Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the criminal law in this regard in order to be better exposed to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security confirmed, on his side, that his law enforcement colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently in dispute with certain novelties concerning this file.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal law was not updated.
As a result, Ottawa has implemented the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several rivers remain under strict monitoring due to the high floods that have occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, a earthquake occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another earthquake took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road is shrinking in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters has caused rainfall in several regions.
Further 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall were expected here, according to the regions, until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the region of Outaouais were most affected.
In total there were up to 100 millimeters of rainfall.
Since the snowmelt that has already accumulated in certain parts of the region is still to be added to these rainfall, the breach of several water flows is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière are here the subject of flood surveillance and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe rainfall has led to the overthrow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
A bridge in Saint-Calixte was continued due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The security service continues to be alert and monitor the situation closely, security council Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec National High Water Center on Wednesday issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont is partially
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial decline in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Council (CCNR) due to his controversial statements about social security and Haitians as well as due to his faulty talk about radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, but certain statements had “included unjustified information about social security and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unacceptable speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts during the day.”
The Supervisory Council also concluded that a debate on suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the code of radio broadcasting.
The CCNR received several complaints regarding the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first sentence was submitted as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should rather provide solid rather than misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide is an expression of foolishness.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
“The majority of the Supervisory Council considers that the controversial consequences of the ‘Dupont le midi’ broadcast had cut a sensitive topic in a family-righteous and appropriate way.”
Therefore, he was not demonstrated in any way against his person.
The last dispute was about the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute on this matter that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favour of Haiti’s aid, as it was uncertain whether those in need would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Council is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
“I have already passed my three-day suspension penalty in this case.”
“My act has been virgin for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Council appeals to the dissemination of an unacceptable way of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted “out of its obligations”.
The consequences for the broadcaster who, among other things, had to report his decisions unilaterally during the main term within a period of three days are small.
King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, has entered a very special course.
The athlete, who brilliates in "Sanda" (full-contact Kung-Fu), in Kickboxing and Thaiboxing, is now rising in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports like Kung Fu and Kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008, to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the struggle everywhere, because for those who don’t like the ground struggle, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, his character, who worked as a security officer and who worked with the UPS company, gave bad news to his rivals in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
“I’ve won in the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
“At the moment I’m preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China.”
“There were those fighters from all categories invited who were ranked among the first four in the last World Championship.”
"I babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze picked up."
“In 2005 I became a veteran in Vietnam.”
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China on the fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
“It’s worth mentioning that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm I'll be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where fisting and footing as well as flooring are permitted.
The battle are usually played on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer that has come from this kind of battle sport is the American Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, who is well known in the world of battle arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the highest and most respected in China,” the sympathetic pound square said.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before he then lost in the final.
“He who defeated me was a real professional,” he analyzed.
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
“The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category.”
Then the winners of each category offer their faces to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung Fu.
450 Million in Contracts Without Offer
In mutual agreement, Hydro-Québec has approved project planning firms $450 million to contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the midst of this line of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the main share, namely that of the project management, to a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gerance", was formed in 2004 as a accompaniment of the decision of Hydro-Québec, to the private sector its responsibility to replace this important, hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerence consortium acquired the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Party of Québécois, recourse to corporate consortiums is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition distortion and price rise.
“This is a new way of a reversed game and disrupts the competition.”
“This means that you’re running in an open form rather than in a secret way,” PQ deputy Sylvain Simard said on a press conference.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the interests of the public can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded this afternoon by saying that the deal would have been a reversed game.
“I remain faithful to my line,” she said, insisting that the PQ was “unreliable” and that it “disappears to hardness.”
She said it was “the least” that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It’s usually a time-long alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise with regard to an invitation to an offer for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its work extent.
The construction process is ongoing and is expected to be set up until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competitive struggle being able to take place; negotiations had already been made.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the Le Devoir newspaper noted last week, the consortium’s model applied in the field of construction engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflow of the Quebec corporate register allows you to designate more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are several dozen, leads to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Gerence Consortium, Normandeau stressed that “the Bay James territory is subject to a special labor dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact in a special way since the 1970s.”
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has led to the fact that the contract over the project management was approved according to the agreement.
"If you make an offer and there are few candidates, your prices will rise to the high."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you, you will negotiate a satisfying deal at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the knowledge of the people," Laporte said.
This agreement approved by the Consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than $50,000 received by the Party of Québec.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the review, the Le Devoir newspaper counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including resource labs, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had 16 contracts, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energie gerrance".
All of these agreements have been negotiated.
They amount to a total of $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were the "Parti libéral du Québec well-known".
Minister Normandeau had claimed that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer liable consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener, but unwilling skeptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main factors of sustainable growth, but not as much in the markings or eco-markings that will control his choice.
Sadly, though it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it is wrapped in information in favour of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of reliable information to complain, an inability that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, held yesterday.
Although they advanced the consumption of so-called social-tolerant products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little loan to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population acknowledges in fact that they don’t believe the company’s environmental commitment as much as the green corporate advertising, according to the measurement instrument developed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the alleged fair products, but also the reliability of the products and brands declaring themselves environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of the politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information about responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently lived by one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and doubtful nature of the information depleted the jealousy of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, one-third of Quebecs are unreliable to the indicated performance of the green products and services that they are trying to put on their hand.
According to another statement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their belief.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from merchants in their city district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and more responsible - the environmentally conscious consumption index had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But the social and environmental consciousness still seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that in 2010 they used public transportation or had preferred the accompanying center to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey that eats the clashes.
State debt for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive debt.
The developing company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the Daniel Langlois-owned eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent to re-responsive it again to its actual cinematic function, obviously did not receive what they demanded.
The government has accepted to engage in this matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government instead offers a debt at a lower level than initially expected, which could trigger an existing solution to favourable conditions, at least according to the opinion of the sources that can be absorbed from the state smell.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has been summarized down again since that.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the “Société de développement des entreprises culturelles” (SODEC), François Macerola, to the Minister of St-Pierre, who leads the Act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he gave her a last report.
However, the Cabinet’s counter proposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to these questions until December 31.
In any case, the premiums of state donations seem to have been actually pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinema complex had rejected a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by submitting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide for real estate projects there which he had not allowed to deliver to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained, on the contrary, of substantial economic aid.
Film director Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed design of the cinema for over a decade, had under great difficulties presented the authentic cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exclusion by the state cash.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his client at the stange.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private-financed campaign, hoping for a $700,000 sum to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single wall continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call down the newspaper "Le Devoir" and it is ignored what he and his group think of the below corrected proposals that were made to them.
The Secret of the Complex Canadian
The new U.S. diplomatic guidelines spread through WikiLeaks revealed the secret about what the United Nations believes under the Canadian disadvantage complex toward the Americans; but they with the same blow reveal the superiority of the latter toward Canada.
Consequently, the U.S. diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter doesn’t mean the Canadian-American relations during the election and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government to maintain its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more picky details than the merely substantial content that one has to stick to.
A connection dated September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full run, reports from what point the United Nations will no longer participate in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
David Wilkins, the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A disadvantage complex that is almost inhabited by the Canadians may cause the Canadian political leaders much more to talk about internal disputes of everyday life than to give the United States the black Peter in this election (such as in the 1988 campaign on free trade),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the speechful Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him.”
The ambassador understands this “horrible silence” less as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he assesses, “will be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the election.”
The other expression of this sense of importance lies in the message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, intending President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their journey will help ensure that the government continues to vote on confidence on the federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a relief program of $30 to $40 billion,” Breese said.
He had not mentioned anywhere that the government had to interrupt the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from collapsing from the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed relief program.
Another statement dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast by CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can watch little subtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly List” or even discourse for the purpose of the CIA’s muscle-protection audiences.
Another statement details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, at her first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is ready to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner may have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, “he sent to the Secretary of State a paper in point to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The Secretary of State has promised to review the documents again.”
Finally, let’s keep in mind that the mood regarding the WikiLeaks website is warming.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close-stay adviser, had explained on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "transported".
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
The UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (FCKW), which corresponds to one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction commitments by the industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the lighting-released FCKWs to the Earth would be avoided if the white-glowing pearls, which so far still represent a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the world’s transportation park’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year the major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FCC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt should be removed from this balance to stabilize the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from falling out of control.
In the whitening pears, 95% of the energy is empty in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces light.
With the compact lighting lights, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED lights, this energy need is reduced twice.
The compact lighting lights last between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED candles, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week – this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a whitening candle, giving an indication of the savings of the exchange plan that is intended to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that the completely new lights deliver very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory resistance.
And they do not contain any silver.
Several specialists have shown that compact lighting pears have reserves as they contain silver and that therefore they need to be discharged as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers to provide a reception site.
The main source of silver emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, is not the compact lighting pipe, but rather the coal power plants that emit significantly more silver to produce the electricity lost by the whitening pipe.
Only in the United States, these coal power plants explode 25,000 tons of silver annually.
The report describes in detail the profits that each country would earn thanks to this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 coal plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion dollars.
Elfenbeinküste awaits exciting announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "unfathomable" publication of the results of the elephant coast presidential election immediately after their deadline blue.
“The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay,” the UN chief said.
He urges all the parties and institutions of the Elfenbein Coast to prove their responsibility and to hold on every initiative until the preliminary results are announced.
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had passed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight three days after the Sunday election, without the publication of the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline, the chairman of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, and the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of the election under the departure of Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, is expecting the abolition of “fake” votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebellion camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the leader of the elephant coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the maneuver practiced by the FN to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had scared the supporters of the president to go to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the claims submitted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
But the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the view that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who disclaims any connection to the former rebels, has regarded the delay in announcing the election results as "acceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows that he has lost; and submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Court after it has prevented the Election Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the politicians of the Elephant Coast that they could be held responsible in the event of any escapes.
Laurent Gbagbo took the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who took the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA), is stable at 9.3% (with the inclusion of the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonal data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office in Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The data of the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the employable population in the metropolis and 9.7% under the involvement of departments abroad.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million French metropolitan workers were unemployed, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of the youth on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youths between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, on their part, a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points seen over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482 000 of people over the age of 50, 6.6% under the involvement of the departments abroad.
Only the 25-49 years old could benefit from the unemployment stability in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage over three months, +0.1 percentage over a year) and 8.8% in France in total.
After a debate on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to follow this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) against 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation process was initiated and he was delivered to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence during an investigation process on the public and suspicious markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with suppression of social assets, abuse of general goods, healery, mediation in corruption, unauthorized corruption and weapons possession, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting ready and intends to speak on all the questions the prosecutor's office will ask him instead of spreading brain spines."
"It's easy to submit him a number of criminal accusations, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the department, had emphasized that the judge before his hearing through his lawyers had a memorandum on his justification.
A family member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keeping his deposit he had to run.
As for the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the Public Service of the Aubagne Hall, was also charged on Wednesday for suppression and complicity, but then under the order to stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision, again put on his foot.
“My client was able to provide explanations about the facts he was accused of.”
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to take him away from his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, the deputy high-state lawyer Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unlawful influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne Hall of Fame, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "Honoring and Disruption of General Ginseng by a Public Service Officer" and the other because of "Middling in Disruption of Public Money".
Alexandre Guérini’s life companion, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with “sharing and suppressing social assets.”
Among the persons who were opposed to Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently detained for a similar case of fraudulent public-handed crafts that had affected Corsica.
The fighters suspect his society of contributing to the washing of money from “high” criminals.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the provision of public contracts, here in particular in the field of waste, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of an anonymous writing in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
According to close sources, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the addition and the operation of a deposito in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities of the urban entrance area of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: Elysée Palace Overpasses Its Medium Function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", kept the French public in breath, puts the diplomacy in alert and emphasizes the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Tehran.
This all under the attentive eyes of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde show some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans who went so far to give these advice about dealing with their own crisis of "receptions" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man detained in France and sought by the U.S. justice because of the trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make this idea credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is titled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with the kidnapping."
François Richier, Elysée's consultant on strategic issues, talked with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method.
They warned the Americans to do everything they can to bring back their own citizens who would be violently detained in Iran.
“Power noise,” they said, “articulated loudly and clearly and without negligence” the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immedial release” in the media.
This is necessary to get the Iranian regime shameful, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this even more, especially because the Iranians ask you not to do that.”
For "Silence solves nothing" passed the discussions attempts on an unprecedented way, the Iranians are "the masters in escape maneuveres."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a “regular, Iranian tactic”: “the arrest for political persecution.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16, on the day when she escapes to the French Embassy) “determines the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians” (230,000 euro deposit).
And he makes it unlikely that the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that “will make it worse.”
“In the near future, the Iranians could arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains detained in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from prison after a Paris judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many other observers, asks questions about this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fullly surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to reject it.
"There has been a rain exchange between the French presidency and the French Justice Minister" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier also wants to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision by the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, repeats, then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranians “is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris.”
During the warning of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not stop its efforts, by means of allegations and the media organized "flight attempts" to believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential median role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation brings fruits as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 appeals to "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is based on so much “thanking” to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy is wondering.
“Despite their praiseful statements, the French authorities confess in secret that they only have a vague understanding of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to collapse this fiction.
“The intense communication efforts are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he analyzes.
In 2008, a policy was launched, which "was then perceived by numerous votes of criticism in France and abroad as premature and unworthy."
“With building up the Syrian role, Paris is trying to show Syria what reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.”
It is also intended to “seed dialogue between Syria and Iran.”
The US Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier told her, “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians have done anything.”
“But we thanked them despite everything.”
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favour of the release of our people.”
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "The Ashe Brother", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
A bill that urges online gaming operators to refuse access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and also living a normal life throughout the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, a ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies will have a year of time to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also took the eye to ask the manufacturers to drop the time limit given daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents asked for it, the responsible added.
It will also provide free programs to those who want to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report about various events associated with intense internet use.
The country is also an unprecedented champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championships 2018-2022: FIFA designates the executive country
In light excitement due to corruption suspicion, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday designates the competing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a highly political election in which ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of the Royal Discipline of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional Highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 or to continue to pursue its headquarters in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political engagement of a world championship.
The work behind the scenes threatens to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to set up a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the disclosures with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well ruin the chances for their own country, the wing of football, which was allowed to win the World Cup only once, namely in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC gave him nourishment by broadcasting a documentary report that takes three influential committee members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou, under fire.
There is enough reason to annoy the FIFA and to annoy the English officials who have primarily led an intense lobbying with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
He hopes to rediscover the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less secure, because the Duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking on trips with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible repressals against the British, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, raise the chances of Russia, which, despite its failures in the file (Stadiums, Hotels, Transports), has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the unmounted indication on the English press reports "instigated an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committees.
“They’re deceiving them with dirt, they’re trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favourites.
The first world economic power, the headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set a very nice project.
However, these new candidates seem early for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat is the FIFA’s warmly requested approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will shed the Asian opportunities to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the records with the continuation of futuristic stages, the FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new regions, but these two countries pose a greater risk because they are certain.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer under the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (as a result of the time shift), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the publicity
De Gaulle was really out.
Mitterand had made him believe that he was stumbling.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be the candidate in 2012.
But the discernment is on the side of the mystery that holds the presidential function, not well faced.
So you have to do as if the doubt exists.
In one way, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would put the perspective of “two mandates” in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night, therefore, spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Lots is missing.
The President only reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment would limit the number of five-year mandates to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone on such meetings.
“In the worst case, you have seven and a half years with me, or in the best case,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the phase after."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day; but not less.
If you have to make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the competition for the nomination with the PS on one page.
But it’s not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which encourages many members of the PS to fight earlier than it was assumed.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment immediately and cautiously responded.
“If he had a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who found himself out with the openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the Central Bank of the ECB last year should provide the opportunity to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European state debt obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt can undoubtedly not afford to disrupt even the present, more than stressed situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be too high.
French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed on a press conference the active role of the ECB in favour of the resolution of the European state debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank could do even more, for example by encouraging her program to buy government bonds.
“I keep my considerations for my European trade partners [...].”
Jean-Claude Trichet, Chairman of the ECB had not shown much discourse about his projects on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels on the previous day, but rather pleased to point out that the program of purchases of state papers on the secondary market would “extend” and that we will “see how the decisions come out” at the meeting on Thursday.
The ECB will leave its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s bond purchases of the Treasury Chamber doubled to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, they said they did new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase rate is in no way doubtful (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable price change.
If the borrowing transactions of more than three months will already be disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be made up on the unlimited cash reserves in a free way, for a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already aware that this measure will extend for a few months.
“I can’t imagine that the ECB will change its program in a substantial way.”
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank's public advocate.
"A progressive withdrawal planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," said Norbert Bräms, a national leader at Sal.
of Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the state debt market, “the ECB should retain such a volume of bonds purchases that lived the market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Having regard to the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on the Eurozone government debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“It has to come on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bond holder said.
For if the interest rates rise to the height, it would even more prevent the states from reducing their debt or just stabilizing it.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
Berlusconi's government goes to cover in Italy
After an annoying start of the week for Italy, the situation was slightly relieved yesterday with the decrease of equal interest rates to 10 years.
Return to the false silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, qualified the situation as “unpredictable” and heard him expecting a “unpredictable” weekend, which the concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the German interest rate had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi said that Spain’s interest rate disagreement is at 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed as "heavily concerned" about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, a public advocate at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, defective tax entries that put the state in danger of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 ... although the current budget for review by the Senate is expected to be 1.3% or 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still make up 4.3% of GDP in the next year (in contrast to 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the call for a new budget collective, which could be used after holidays for a sum of €7 billion.
“When necessary, new savings must be taken,” says Auditor Olli Rehn.
This time, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
“The foundation of the Italian economy is well and its accounts are regulated, that we have repeated for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustworthy member of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
“At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) is demanding less stabilization progress than other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief public officer.
It remains the question of political instability.
On the 14th of December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a question of the House of Representatives, resulting in which the anticipated elections could be held at the end of March.
Therefore, there is a slightly favorable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
In a press conference in Paris, Christine Lagarde said: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans keep together clearly, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative - the yesterday recorded drop on the interest rates of European state bonds was water on the mulls of governments as well as the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot be discussed.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, probably the most effective target of speculants today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceivability, which is burdening on the banking systems,” the opinion of economists of the Exane BNP Paribas said.
“The political time goes much slower than the markets.”
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the danger that is hidden in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and in the further sense with their counterparts in the G20 are going well forward.
This is also due to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
It is planned to take unconventional measures to strengthen the Eurozone countries back in the crossroads of markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not an explicit fundraising, he will prepare the terrain for this.
The first publicity spending from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for the next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF’s additional, direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries first and foremost, are committed to the implementation of structural reforms, especially in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms that add to the savings measures, however, are intended to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are on a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are to avoid to seek international aid at any cost before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on unnecessary structural reforms that will bring back their confidence to the last.
On the other hand, the European capitalists are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the public bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the passage to Paris on November 24, was the first to bring the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to regain in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European state debt, consider an extension of about €100 billion would be sufficient, preferably in the form of a direct liquidity issue.
This fund exists: the European mechanism of dedicated financial stabilization, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A council that has all opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions fall.
Snow and smooth: 24 departments in alarm level orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary traffic networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the alarm level of Orange due to the threat of snow and glacial risks.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have added to the 20 departments already in the alarm level of Orange; 18 from Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowflakes tanger the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it slightly snow on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snowflakes are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic obstacles and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Britain is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise to use their own vehicle only in emergencies, and the use of some TER travel buses was stopped throughout the day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
There were no specific restrictive measures for heavy traffic on Wednesday.
The prefecture calls on the drivers to be very cautious on the roads and to adjust their driving behavior accordingly.”
The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cease on Thursday 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of the flights from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full course, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, it is called the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the way, the state has called for a capitalization of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical scheme, this is the amount that would then allow the SGP to allocate on the markets a part of the financial amount to their doubts.
Today, we have finally gotten the first high bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Financial Commission, contains the planned measures to cover the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the establishment of a closing tax and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
First, as referred to in Article 15 of the draft law, it goes “to the access of the public-right institution Société du Grand Paris”.
This is referred to as: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
Second, it is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it to increase the product derived from it and to respond to this increase of the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would it bring?
It is a mystery.
This sum is not mentioned in the text.
The $4 billion is far away.
“The tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital totation that will be charged by the state and will gradually be paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project,” the statement said.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
“Since the moment in which income is recorded (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the project for three years and then only earn from the 4 billion,” he said.
“This is recorded in the budget and gradually removed.”
The SGP predicts that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose promised 4 billion can be sought for a long time, is at risk of triggering a fairly moving parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be held on December 7.
Crazy Hacker and Emmy Spy
The case of WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On one side, it has revealed itself as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the Sinner of Lightning that governs the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, giving a prediction to the future dominated by regression.
But let’s go on the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any document created by a intelligence service (a x-loved nation) consists exclusively of newspapers.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits don’t throw anything further than what was read in any X-loved journal for months (except for those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the scaryly caricated profile of Gaddafi has long been offering cabaret artists material for their chains.
The rule, according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (through the Graal, the mystery of the Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosary Crucifers) exactly repeats what was already written in previous works.
This comes not only because the author of occult texts doesn’t want to publish research (but because he didn’t know where news about the non-existent would be to be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they’ve already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The secret acts as well.
The informant is fool, and fool (or limited minds) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes as true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, were the same as those published by Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a withdrawal made about the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, that the missions – at least since the end of World War II and since then the leaders can call each other or take an aircraft to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and have turned themselves, with the exception of some small representative tasks, into spy centers.
Any viewers of investigative films know this very accurately, and it does not happen because of glory that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of glorification and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-loving hacker can disclose the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Council.
Furthermore, the scandal is bringing less victims than rather the “sharp judges” into trouble.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Earlier, at Orwell’s times, all power could be united like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since been perfectly correct where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you take into consideration what is going on today that even the secret crypt of power can no longer escape from the control of a hacker, then the control transition ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the citizen’s scammers – can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power, which is no longer able to preserve its secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means stealing them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged either Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation that has been added to such a huge power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer provide any reserved information online in the future – that would be similar to an accusation on the street roof.
But it’s equally obvious that with the current technologies it’s forgotten to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state is moving on a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and specific relationships be discussed for certain ears in the future?
I know very well that my forecast at the moment sounds science fiction and romantic, but I find myself forced to present me the government agents, moving in a secret way emsig on uncontrollable routes, carrying their communications nonewhere other than in their merely memory, and beyond the few written information they have received, hiding in the shoe trade.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed boxes: basically, Watergate’s spy search was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like a cancer today, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wiring.
The (analog) video casets had allowed film researchers to search for a film band for a band by spinning from back to forward and revealing all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today allow nothing but to jump from chapters to chapters, i.e. in macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including shipping.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were scattered between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it’s time to investigate the compliance with the promises of financing that have been resolved quickly (also called “Fast Start” or “Fast Financing”), which have been achieved by the developing countries.
And the rough French scenes have already been revealed.
The Copenhagen Treaty undertakes developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU pulled all registers to convince its partners about the fact that they are committed to fast-start financing: detailed policy reports of their Member States, press conference, large subconferences, brochure distribution.
The Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see if all developed countries did the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, leading it to the right path to respect its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional deposit has been made without going to the disadvantage of the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the direction value he considers the best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a target for the year 2009: the international financing will beined, and will provide 150 million in the framework of the “Fast-Start” financing over three years.
Other countries have selected similar orientation values, whether for year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or on a global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decline) - France suggests to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the encryption in donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their accounting mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as an equivalent of 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is hard to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects, based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that one accepts as an equivalent to a donated euro... Furthermore, only the cost of the loan for the capitalist country should be calculated as an engagement (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing else in the sense than the following consideration: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by receiving 91.5 per cent of loans (389.8 million euros) and giving 8.5 per cent of loans (36.1 million euros) – see also the EU document to convince itself about it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses large-scale loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including others) fulfil their obligations with 100% donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfill its obligations, France only gives €10 and understood a comparable deposit.
A beautiful hockey.
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double disadvantage: in one part with a further development of the action over time and in the other part with the reality of the financial investment.
France manages to believe it has spent 420 million “new and additional” millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact; once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not allowed to be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is just a small question for a relatively short time compared to the total of climate discussions.
But it could be the drop too much in the UNFCCC’s immense machinery.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its recording for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other European Union countries.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the controversial subject of long-term financing (an other, decisive and currently discussed topic): the question of the “releasibility” or the way its loans are booked cannot be escaped.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "reportability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise from the international trust base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "at the light of the small number of analysed samples do not represent statistically significant value, but represent the illustration character of the problem treated," had between July and September purchased the foods commonly consumed within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals plus a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruits, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were studied as well as nuts from laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The table balance is downward: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely cancerous and five classified as safe carziogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrin disruptor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Even if in the approximate whole of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, it is very well assumed that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially cancerous substances or substances with endocrin disturbance factor is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potential cancerous residues and three secure to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a meal for the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the Hacksteak, thunfish from the boxes, even the baguette and the cage gum were spotted with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the conductive water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At dinner, the lax steak with 34 identified chemical remains was the “most rich” and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this “deodorant cocktail” for the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on its part, proposed "in light of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "augment of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) referred to the presence of remains of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
