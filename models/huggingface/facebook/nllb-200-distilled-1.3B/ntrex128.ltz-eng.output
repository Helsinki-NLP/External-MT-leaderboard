Welsh MPs are worried about looking like idiots.
There is a dispute among some MPs over a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are worried about being ridiculed.
One Labour MP was concerned it would rhyme with Twp and PwP.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means dumb and pwp means kaka.
A Plaid MP said the group as a whole was "just happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was open to the name change, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not be far from the same.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, with the deputies themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received wide support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option gained more support in a public meeting on the issue of the MPs' title.
The deputies seem to be suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may cause headaches for the incumbent, Elin Jones, who is expected to table the bill on the changes within two weeks.
The reform legislation includes other changes, such as the way the Assembly functions, rules on the disqualification of deputies and the drafting of the committee system.
Deputies have the final say on what to call themselves when debating legislation.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was cast in a bid to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he does not want to recognize the name.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are as quiet as the bells of the Harlem battle
"The old people used to say that there was a cafe and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is nothing left.
He said the disappearance of coffee shops was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
The cafes are no longer the crowded stairs where people go regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the managers imagine, and sooner or later they will be back where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums and filled with people who would not help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he said, "and they want to close these churches quickly because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital city  Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved in in the 1930s.
A black community from a nearby location took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major thoroughfare for trade in Harlem, who did not want to hire blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the bell.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's grandson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the game "The Poor Man's Bell".
The expert who played the game in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also found that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has unfolded at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by lay officials, others by the bishop's diocese.
The sacristy, its governing body, with lay-responsibility, wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs to the sacristy", although the sacristy was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some pastors complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old while diving for lobster in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been on the roof for half an hour with friends on a Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and was overwhelmed with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
The hammer said he thought at first it was just the joy of catching a lobster, but then realized he was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I'm going to be able to!
His whole keyhole was up, and the lamb realized when he came to the son.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water, and there was a shark in the water", added the ram.
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was pronounced dead in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
The swimming pool master, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's takes boats, super drugs and Debenhams, with department stores-style beauty departments with specialist assistants.
As part of a major push into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which is steadily growing as fashion and homewares return, these larger beauty departments will be in 11 stores across the country, and more stores in the coming year if they are successful.
Supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill shelves that are otherwise reserved for TVs, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products including for the first time ever the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands.
The L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, which are already up to date, will also be given more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and small quantities of everyday groceries in small stores mean that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Ainsbury's has opened Argos Oulets and hundreds of after-hours and also several Habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the partnership quickly ended after a dispute over the share of revenue from the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's selling its 281 drugstores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
Llodys was to play a role in the plan, by launching an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who the client can ask for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need, and with a friendly environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old ways of shopping in the shade.
Peter Jones is rumoured to have been in talks to sign Holly Willoughby for £11 million.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, has gone berserk after TV presenter Holly Willoughby signed a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has last-minute dismissed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, from her lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts at Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "squinting" when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting on Thursday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and has doubled Willpughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK and went to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would have weighed on their long-term future, which would have accompanied them through the next century.
When they heard this, they were all amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on the day, it was so close to the beginning.
There is a warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's bankable stars, could cost the company millions as it invests heavily in products from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear, and there are now potential delays to the launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been married to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the helm in 2016, and Jones, 52, was sworn in as president in March.
The couple travels together on vacations, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with knowledge of Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings".
We swore and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for a comment that some would consider "unpresidential", and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Said Trump in his "television host voice".
I have given up nothing.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting, after the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on denuclearization, however, are not moving forward.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's earlier disarmament moves.
The US would instead continue with sanctions to further pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
We would have gone to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim would have led to positive results - no more missile tests, aid to free hostages, and the repatriation of American soldiers killed in combat by deadly remnants of missile tests stopped, hostages freed and the remains of American soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have only 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe for foreign personnel to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief effort.
Regarding the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared enough for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not available anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though there was a warning, is likely to have cost many lives.
Traveling between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but will need at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the main issue of his election campaign, donating money for roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko's government was also plagued by a lack of funding, and he will be re-elected next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority hold a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and ten thousand displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bayonets and other brutal weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the game to a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team went 1-0.
He picked up the ball with his left foot and shot towards the goal.
The experiment is rotated high over the box, towards the right corner of the net.
The ball is passed over a bouncing arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the edge coming and I touched it once, and I didn't think about it and just shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 up after the break by a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before jumping towards Liverpool halfway through.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in midfield.
He then threw a beautiful pass that sent Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran through the defence and finished in the long pot with a left-footed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
According to agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday, sending waves up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at Mews on John Street at 7:55am, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People in the area who have seen or heard anything should report to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the area of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I also encourage anyone else, especially taxi drivers who have recorded Dashcam footage, to contact us, as they may have information that may be important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
In the afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she had been found.
Police are continuing their investigation and have informed other family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just about to go back to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building at this time.
He was speechless, knowing what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it may take hours before they can return home.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the whole area was being considered a crime scene at the moment.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible".
At 14:00 two police vans were parked inside the lockdown and another outside the lockdown.
A few policemen stood inside the detention centre and watched the residential area.
Anyone with information should contact @MerPolCC, dial 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the new memorial to be featured in the "Rewrite History" series.
His exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the Taliban's fanatics and puritanical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Lord Crick's suggestion as "nonsense" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the discussion about the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would be the target.
The symbolism of the English Civil War was not ordered by Cromwell and was not carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroft's large-scale depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure many still consider to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, probably first in the late 19th century as today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a very accurate representation is still a matter of debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Pig slaughtered farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his family name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery near a market stall in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he had arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby swamp.
He said that there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on his wounds.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig had butchered the farmer to death, reports said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted", said the cousin with the surname Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not Yuan's pig or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family is likely negotiating with market authorities over compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts.
In 2006, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could drive the animal away.
After a 2012 Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're just curious, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show enough respect", he said.
Heavy rain in the southwestern United States due to Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
DRosa had wind gusts of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane as of 5:00 am eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
The rose is expected to draw a sunset to the north.
Meanwhile, a channel is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving toward the west coast of the United States, and the Rosa is approaching the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, which will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest U.S.
The storm will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, interacting with the nearer channel, will form widely distributed heavy craters in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 2 to 3 inches of snowfall per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible, with weather conditions worsening due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely dangerous to walk in the desert at the risk of tropical slush.
Thick reefs can create canyons that quickly become rivers and thunderstorms will bring with them locally rough air and dust.
The nearer channel will bring thick local reefs to parts of the Southern California coast.
Slopes of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mud flats and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of the travel season.
Some distributed tropical cyclones begin to move closer to Arizona in late Sunday and early Thursday before spreading further into late Thursday and Friday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Thursday and Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations across the US as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a solar eclipse in the central United States.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat will try to expand and expand.
In many of the central and eastern United States, a warm start in October is expected with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City reached 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast gives a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people watched the shocking testimony at the Supreme Court on Thursday by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continues, and the broadcasters interrupt regular broadcasts for a last-minute Friday debate: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake made with the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had fully touched her and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people watched the trial on Friday.
The company has averaged viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that aired the trial, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulty counting people looking in offices.
To illustrate this, the audience is the same as a playoff football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican Bureau issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was booed by protesters on Friday while trying to get a lift to a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down as he was being watched and was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, whereas many women do not have power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator closed that he had more to say after the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all later broadcast live for hours as the Judiciary Committee voted to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority wanted.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "playing politics" with her plans to leave the European Union, undermining Britain's future and national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson underlined his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes on each other would be "totally ridiculous".
Wayde-Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors Louisiana State Police Refugee Officers, the State Poice Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "efforts and efforts to seek justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-8-inch (2.01 m) tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said his team was devastated and in shock after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano spills ash on Mexico City
Spattered ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, registering 183 gas and ash spills in the last 24 hours.
The center recorded some thunder and earthquakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed a zoom of volcanic activity that has been shaking 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists were held back during a riot against the police with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Kettle-busting also broke out later in the day and police removed their handcuffs to control the fighting.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forget, no pardon" against unionists who had chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region, a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, although the result was narrow against the split by the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the election at polling stations due to the region's violent conflict.
Pro-independence groups camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, says he has no hope for the prospect of an independent Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy, because they could walk, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties found it difficult to stay in power this year, with most of the most prominent leaders in exile or in prison awaiting their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protesters on the phone in support of the police, said the conflict was heated by politicians from both sides.
"The pressure is getting stronger", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European elections.
As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government is to stand", he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after running into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point the car was shot with a handgun.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers by Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Livingston's promotion rocks Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second win in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and play Leaders Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
The previous season, the Rangers were defeated by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still enjoying victory since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chances against open visitors.
Holt's team should have been out of the way long before the hit, as their directness caused the Ranger problems.
Scott Robinson was forced through but carried his effort to the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only count his effort before he met Craig Halkett before the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery to the visitors.
And so the gold of choice fell.
The Rangers were given a free throw and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play Menga, who once touched and struck from the center of the box.
At this point, the Rangers dominated possession but found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied a leg by Rangers goalkeeper Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide by another play by Livingston.
Crusaders always came in and out of Livingston's box, while two eleven-yard shots were required - after the hat-trick challenged replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were withdrawn.
Wonderful by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staff have changed little since returning to the top flight, but great credit must go to the defender for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett led a huge, super-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through on their toes.
Ranger, however, had little inspiration.
As good as they were during Gerrard's time, they fell short by those standards.
The last pass was missing  only when they were counting down the home side  and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers who were in midfield.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne.
There was laughter in the blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom in Turkey and its accession to the EU.
Erdogan was on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police took security measures to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents  many of them Kurds  have also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both protests reflect the divisions of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and as a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with a car.
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southwest of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics helped, but the man died at the scene.
The crash happened months after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The city police said officers were going to identify the man and inform the family.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorderly conduct
Six prisoners were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison official said.
A disturbance broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and it continues.
Specialist Tornado officers were deployed to deal with the order, which involved eight prisoners in a wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for blisters.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible could be sent to jail and spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, offensive officers were called to the prison to deal with a major disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa draws its last power through the southwestern desert and brings flood risks.
The National Weather Service has warned of flooding for months and days in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route over Phoenix's den and come closer in late May with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service wrote in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated showers of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin may get 1 to 2 centimeters, with isolated summers up to 4 centimeters.
For those without flood risks, the pink rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some rain is likely to be good as the southwest is currently in dry conditions.
In the United States, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-lowest category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way over the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane-force on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is moving into cooler waters in the Pacific and is losing strength.
So, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flood risk.
3 to 6 inches of rain are expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, before moving up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern United States desert, according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudflows in the desert, and earthquakes and mountains.
Midsomer Norton robbery four suspected murderers arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terraces area of Midsomer Norton, at around 0400 hours on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, but his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have called for witnesses who may have recorded something on the phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffers from community and Democratic Party anger.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh is an election against the reckless and biased tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's recklessness and rudeness throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally rebuffed accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her as a teenager.
Ford also swore that this statement was true.
The President said on Saturday that the American people have seen the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the finest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a proven track record of public service.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I do not run, but I run in order", he says.
That's why I went everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that he was on a mission to "stop and slow down".
The first decisive Senate-level vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as early as Friday, a senior Mattha employee told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, number rising
At least 384 people have died, many washed away as huge waves washed up on the coast as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities in Samosir said.
Hundreds of people attended a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as 20-foot high waves in the twilight hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"As the tsunami threat became more pronounced yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately leave", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was full of cars, huts, huts, it took everything to the land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had a speed of 800 km/h at sea before it hit the coast.
Several people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the disaster response publicly show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn away and collapsed and a mosque completely surrounded by water.
The Samaritans were still in the coastal city.
Earthquakes have been felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology said in a statement that the energy released in the earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of a long-drained bay may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the damage could be more severe on the 300km coastline north of Palu, in an area called Doggola, near the epicenter.
Communication has completely collapsed and we are without information from Donggola, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be worse", he said.
The agency has been criticized for not only reporting that Palu was hit by the tsunami, but officials say the waves came at the same time as the tsunami warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a high platform warning people of a tsunami by shouting in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, tearing apart buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages and communications to be cut off around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has sent first transport planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still urgently need food and basic necessities.
The local airport was opened only for rescue crews and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It was very bad.
While World Vision personnel from Donggola arrived safely in Palu City, where employees were housed in tent cities on the premises of this office, they must have seen scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that many of their homes were destroyed", he said.
It was very bad.
As aid teams began to realize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with extensive experience were not allowed to enter Palu.
According to Indonesian law, equipment and personnel are only allowed into the country if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
But that's only a matter of time.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
So the government says, "OK, if it's a national disaster, we can open up to international help, but that hasn't happened yet".
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and families hope that the missing are among the wonders that will always appear after such disasters.
The story of Samson is like a little boy being rescued from a canal.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was buried under a pile of debris, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders who were lost for the Asian Games,
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"Like an old horse in a parachute, I carried my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon said that in the hours after the rumors of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group were spreading, he sent WhatsApp messages to the team participating in the Beach Festival.
His messages were unfortunately drawn with only one horn, and not with two blue horns.
"I think the date means the news is just to be delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling a machine in Newport/Levee.
The robbers stole $26,750 from a security guard who was trying to cash an ATM in Newport/Levee on Friday, according to a statement from Newport Police.
The driver was about to empty the ATM at a detention complex and was about to cash in, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was busy, another man came from behind and stole the money bag that was being delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine how many.
Anyone with information about the identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing on Twitter, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes in conjunction with her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who is unable to appear on the show for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
Although it is a shortened form of his professional name, the West has previously suggested that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du", West said earlier this year at a radio show for his new album Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am the sea, you are the sea.
It comes from Kanye, daat means the one, the only you - the mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a mirror of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was once known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has decided to go by Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-lead singer, Jay-Z, has also always played in a low and high key.
DAMLO in Mexico has vowed to use the military only against civilians
Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador has vowed under the same conditions that the military will never be used to oppress the Mexican people.
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, troops shot and killed 300 people at a time when left-wing extremism was sweeping Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that he will support young Mexicans by providing monthly student grants and by opening more free universities.
He has argued that unemployment and lack of schooling foster criminal gangs.
The US would double its funding of AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in AI research, says AI investor and friend Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after increasingly heard in US government circles that the US has no proper strategy in research on AI.
In fact, China unveiled its plan last year: to be the first to research AI by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good start, given that all other nations are so far behind the US, and we are working on the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next jump being made in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNN this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello game, later becoming CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee knew about previous technology competitions in the US like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they were next to help find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
It's not just China that's leading the academic world; it's society, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said improved immigration laws could also stifle AI research in the US.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to AI professors", he said.
The Chinese State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to do research for the US, but the quality of academic work is not as good as in China, according to LEE.
Earlier this year in the US, the Department of Defense established a joint AI center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million in AI.
The US government's proposal to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonia decides on referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a move to defuse a regional dispute with Greece that has prevented them from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of neighboring Macedonia is being used to refer to the province and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal for the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has shown that it will be difficult to reach the required 50 percent to make the elections valid.
The question of the referendum reads: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be paid for admission to organizations such as the EU and NATO by Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs said they would be happy with the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities in the election would be reported until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to the 2016 general election, when 66% of eligible voters voted.
"I am choosing to come to my children, our place is in Europe", says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a resident of the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are known to have voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, quietly set up a small stage in front of the tents of those boycotting the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter head-on, not through the door of the Kavadarkov hut.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring us significant investments in Macedonia, which is currently at over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority is for NATO and the EU because more than 80 percent of the population is for NATO", Zaev said after leaving the polling booth.
He said that the result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one must vote.
A vote would be the first major setback to the pro-Western government's campaign since May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks through Brighton's defence and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling break through Brighton's defence at Manchester City in a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored with ease in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in midfield at the start of the race.
He scored three runs against Brighton's defenders and then took the field.
Aguero then faced four opponents.
He pushed a defender away before he was shot in the back of the head.
He then went to the left where Sterling took over.
The Englishman was forced to press forward with the first ball on the pitch and passed back to Aguero, who put the ball into the right corner of the Brighton goalkeeper with his right foot.
"Aquero is currently having foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We had to let him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he scored in that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first ever Premier League advantage.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aquero scored the ball well into Brighton's half.
He made a wonderful pass over the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Sane dribbled a bit before he passed the Sterling a long pass.
The Sky Blues shot the ball into the net just before it was out.
City play Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The joke about the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated in the playoffs, as a reason to force a fresh start.
However, the ever-challenging joker hopes to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs, one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies cling to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still struggle to cement their division title.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can make a great game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is probably going to be playing at the highest level I'm going to experience this year.
Why shouldn't I face it?
The Nationals have yet to announce how they will start on Sunday, but are certainly well advised to let the jokers pitch in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will play on his break day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump on campaign trail in West Virginia
The President has highlighted the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the House of Representatives while stressing the importance of a Republican victory in this midterm election.
Everything we have predicted is on the line in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones - I'm not just running but I'm running really, so I'm fighting for good candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible radical groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take power in all circumstances, you see the sinfulness, the church.
Those who don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to get power and control, because if they want power and control, we don't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistance and blockade".
"And you see today in the last four days", he said, "the Democrats are being called rosy and senseless and nasty and confused".
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name as the most heavily exploited.
Do you remember the answer here?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, wait. What is it?
No, uh no, I'm going to -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer God's gift.
It's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my constituency voted against me, I was little surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a working class who is blessed we would not be welcome - just because we say what we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is treated similarly because she is strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me because I didn't have the right to be Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt sees the importance of responsible economic, national security, and European engagement ironically similar to what Jeremy has criticized in senior leadership.
The note for Nottingham East workers' meeting on Friday says that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local labor representative, Friday night meetings were on time.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of many meetings and promises of friendly, friendly politics are more forgotten than they were long ago, if at all.
It is increasingly striking that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is being made as acceptable as the party leadership.
This was shortly after Jeremy took over, as colleagues with whom I had previously spoken would have expected me to take on similar political views and positions that I would never have otherwise taken - in national security and in the EU internal affairs.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - I get a barrage of comments on social media against the politics of the centre, saying I would not have my place in the Labour Party.
And that's just my experience.
However, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and who are not about to look away.
One of the saddest aspects of these political times is how the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for a culture of tolerance in the Labour Party.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with every movement of disbelief or change of choice the party is getting stronger.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years to stay calm, not be too hard, and then I'd be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, spurred on by a Thatcher government slump during which my classroom virtually collapsed, I have tried to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local politician or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could question my political position and the points on which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who support the Friday movement, all I want to say is that if the country is heading for a Brexit, that it will hurt housing, trade and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my running for the Labour Party.
But the only message I have regarding the Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that no pressure or political statement will stop me from acting on what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose Ayr uncapped upwards
Two recent attempts have increased the final score, but there is no doubt Ayr deserves the win in this spectacular Tennent's premiership match of the day.
They're now in the top ten, the only undefeated team in the country.
In the end, it was a better defense, as well as better seizing of chances, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie could be proud of.
"We are challenged in our matches and still not defeated, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they took the chance better than I did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, seeded by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr close, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, given in a Warriors game, weakened Melrose and allowed Jason Baggot to start an unchanged try.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr just before half-time, then converted a solo attempt to break 17:5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was fouled, Ayr was able to recover in a new start by a run by Stafford McDowall, replaced by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage of a run by Bruce Colvine, after heavy pressure.
The home team came back, as usual, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tying the Climo without a ball on the power line, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of the attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to turn around as he did from the start after Kyle Rowe was able to catch David Armstrong's kickoff and knock out sidekick Gregor Henry in the fifth lap.
After star player seeks a new career in the hotel industry
Ford Kieran is looking to make a career in the hotel industry after being nominated as a restaurant chain executive.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis stars in the popular BBC show he writes and co-stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine episodes would be the show's last, and Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was about to enter Glasgow's "flourishing restoration industry".
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol under cover in the headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings hoisted an ocean blue flag.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon run under the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right".
It is our duty to take it back.
Bolivia is surrounded by land, and the memory of a 19th century conflict in Chile, lost coast, is still alive and the desire to sail again to the Pacific Ocean.
Right now, the hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the spirit of unity and independence and hopes for a positive decision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the International Court of Justice's decision on big screens in the hope that The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia and  after decades of sporadic talks  Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia over sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, is heavily focused on Monday's talks.
"We are about to join the Pacific again", he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that not much would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based DUN agency has no authority over Chile and has said it will not interfere in any talks.
The fact that the court's decision is being delivered six months after the final hearings shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of bringing in the Bolivian oil, they've been shrinking it for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration", said Zarate.
Morales' combative rhetoric weakened all Chilean will, had clarified.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue to talk, but it is extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, said the court's decision was made very quickly.
Monday offers Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to resolve a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the maritime outlet as a political springboard.
"Bolivia will never stop asserting its right to access the Pacific", he added.
Judgment is an opportunity to try to put our past behind us.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the US to keep its promises made to rival presidents at the Singapore summit.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to revive disrupted nuclear diplomacy negotiations more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a nightmare that further sanctions and US demands against a declaration to end the Korean War would force Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of approving the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step toward massive disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about disarming an arsenal that it sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show a massive surge of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a set of oversized headgear for their SS19 collection at the Catwalk, which will shade the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Absolutely impractical hits flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations onto the runway.
The highlight of Valentino was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather floating over the model's head.
Others oversized accessories with ornate watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also released some weird masks just for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have closed lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving suit complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looks like a melted ice cornet.
And if you want to see more, you won't be disappointed.
Fashion observers predict that the enormous cape could find its way to your street.
The oversized hat strongly resembles the feast of La Bomba, the spatula with a 60 cm wide board, which has been seen on Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hit that flooded social media is sending another big creation onto the catwalk - a street-side basket the size of the model it represents.
The deep orange brush basket, with brush strings and a white leather handle, was the main focus of Jacquemus's La-Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hits and beaches on our streets next summer. Because designers have made such a big impact, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic performance and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened through individual and collective achievement in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational institution with a coordinated and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
When you speak to him in tongues, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are at the very top, with the best results in independent schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got an A+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students achieved A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent achieved A in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as electives are now considered the same as main subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the English Vocational and Skills Commission found that employers reported that it was difficult to fill vacancies, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future tasks.
With more future jobs that require languages, these skills will become increasingly important in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, learning a second language gives you a real head start on the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French coming in at 15 percent as the only language in the second place.
That's why it's so important to invest in language learning for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that may be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there is always a choice of languages in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve whatever the future holds.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are vital to the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools provide this choice, diversity and immersive performance for Scotland's young people.
It's all right.
John Edward is a director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is only necessary to determine how many minutes he will play.
"It's more like one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked earlier this week what his plans are for the Lakers' six-player preseason schedule.
"I don't need a pre-season player at this point in my career to be ready", he said.
Trump's tour of the West Virginia ballot box, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a hell of an election campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the coming week, with stops at friendly healthy places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the pipeline for his nomination for the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to reduce the fear of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election rally for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, 7 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election campaign online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's nomination for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, whose election was put on hold for a week over allegations of sexual assault by a former senator while the FBI investigates the case.
But the first goal is to help the Republicans get their face out in the November election and get a new boost.
President Trump's campaign said the five events next week are aimed at re-energising volunteers and supporters, while Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, Reuters reported.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the crucial time of the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, the ballgame may bring nightly fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to come to help him get votes in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 The USA team shows courage in the fight to keep the hopes for the individual event alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four-day matchup could be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing swing is a very invented sporting concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more so than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say the momentum is?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're down to four, so we're looking at it as a small jump", said Jordan Spieth, as he closed out the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead with 12 to play.
The Americans, as the Spurs say, are feeling a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to be proud of, not least the form of Spurs and Justin Thomas, who have played together every day, and both of them are coming off three of four points.
The regatta was deadly from the tee to the green and is exemplary.
The cheerful kicking intensified as his lap progressed, sinking a major hole to tear the match to pieces with Thomas two-for-two behind him.
His pitch, which won the game at 15, was quashed with a similar scream, of the kind that meant he believed the American team was not out.
"You just have to dig deep enough and take care of your own match", said the regret.
That's all that's left of all these games now.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old but beloved couple are four ahead of four and can do no more wrong.
The only couple to not bogey on a Saturday afternoon was the Mollywood couple, who avoided bogeying on Saturday mornings, Fridays and the nine-back Friday mornings.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow in and out of the crowd, it is cemented that they are the players to beat on a Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to sail a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
It is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole from which they could not quickly emerge.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you out of the laugh.
The four balls and four players are so fascinating to look at because of the interactions between the pairings; the advice they give; the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is well ahead for the final day, but this four-player session also showed that Team USA has the will to fight, which has been questioned, especially the Stateside.
Europe goes 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final
Europe has a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a fourth ball of a Samsen in Game 4 against the USA at 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two wins over a faltering Tiger Woods to close their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a poorly-started American side in the quarter-finals, sitting 3-1 in the series.
The U.S. offers more resistance in the fourth, winning two games, but they don't make up the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row while at Molinari, together with Molliwood after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to score four points since the first four games in Ryders Cup history.
Woods and Patrick Reed won in the quarter-final, and they were well matched against an empty Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau in a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who had established himself through two games at Samsun, occasionally showed brilliant breakouts in the fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had taken a break from the foursome earlier in the day, returned to play Henrik Stenson in the foursome and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third ranked in the world - by 2&1.
Europe is not just having a nice, breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pace for the Americans with two points at Samsun.
They recorded a close 2&1 win over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-final and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the quarter-final despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit in singles, though Furyk's side only needed to hold on to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, as usual, a counterattack on Sunday seems unintended by them.
North Korea says "no way" they would unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations in Samsun that continued sanctions would deepen mistrust of the United States and there is no way North Korea would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly that North Korea had shown a lot of goodwill over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and not further expanding nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Whatever happens, we don't see an equal response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri repeats the well-known complaint about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for each step, he emphasizes his statement in which he does not explicitly reject a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint letter written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States told Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to enforce it in a coercive manner, and raises objections to declarations of the end of war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions could force us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which a US leader had previously presented at the United Nations.
The minister, however, pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a mess".
Similarly, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that the North Korean missile target on the US mainland was triggered by "Devil President" Trump calling Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the first steps toward denuclearization, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for that, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Tuesday: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue to be stepped up and at least be pushed through until we achieve complete, definitive and proven denuclearisation".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in the hope that by withholding funds they could deter Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes of the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his most recent visit did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea denounced him for his "gangster" demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the Americans took appropriate measures.
He said Kim would take appropriate measures, seek security guarantees Trump had provided in Singapore and move toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students choose to take a break.
A new Harvard University court is urging all its students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of drinking caffeine in the night.
One academic found that students at the university, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put together the trial, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the trial after a four-judge panel ruled on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the four months a young woman came to me and said, "I am a woman of six months. Why do I not know now?"
He said that until now no one had told him anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The Cour, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as bring about an overall sense of well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chief executive of the university's health services, said the university decided to take the case to court after noticing that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course offers a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a dormitory where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and then learn about the effects of caffeine and caffeine, but also how sports performance is affected by sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, the participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A quarter of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
We don't know if it's worth changing students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as anyone has a right to know about the health problems caused by smoking cigarettes", added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of boasting about having studied all night still exists, the professor said, and the increasing technology and pressure on students has resulted in sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
He said that ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overwork and anxiety, even to prevent one from contributing, as lack of sleep causes the brain to starve and one feels hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the court even after he had chosen one of his courses in his last year at Harvard.
He said the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to offer the court to the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to get all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when to go to bed, but also for when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: goal by Menga to Gerrard's team
Rangers suffered another defeat by a goal from Dolly Menga, which demoted Steven Gerrard's narrowly-bound side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox were attempting to secure their first game since a 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' line-up lacked inspiration and could not keep up.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by goal difference.
And there could be further problems for the Rangers after captain Calum Spence was treated for a head injury, apparently caused by an object fired at the end of the game.
Gerrard switched sides eight times, allowing him to overtake Ayr and reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11, which cost Hearts a point last week and where he was thrilled as his well-drilled team beat the opponents every time.
The Rangers had more balls, but Livingston had more balls.
They were two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
A deep free throw from Keaghon Jacobs to captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow the only shot in the defense to hit the post from a distance.
The Rangers were able to gain control, but it looked more like hope than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had gained an eleven-meter after a quarter of an hour of running into Steven Lawless, but the referee, Steven Thomsen, ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers scored just twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble deflecting Lassana Coulibaly's cap shot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one can argue that they did not earn it for their efforts alone.
Once again, the Rangers failed to come to terms with a standard situation from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and selected Menga for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard responded at half-time and swapped the Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which had a virtually direct impact as the outfielder overpowered Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came running from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide the visitors with exactly the genre of play they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have continued to exploit this lead in the final moments, but McGregor held Jacobs's bass before Lithgow shot a long-range corner.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton had a late 11th-yard field goal as Jacobs went in, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today, and still more... the late physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
The Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the Geiger scanner.
The Geiger counter, since a mainstay of science, has also become a mainstay of pop culture, with the 1950 film Bells of Colorado starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, which resembled more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter that's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you put your headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms being emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, it's going to be a blast!"
Hans Vieger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention named after him lives on.
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system detect secondary cells
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system detect and kill secondary cells
Vaccination helps the immune system recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and then converting them in the lab
They can then identify a protein that is present in many cancer cells and then inject it back into the cells.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
In a woman who was treated with the vaccine, which helps the immune system detect malignant cells, the ovarian cancer disappeared after more than 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are removed from a patient, then converted in the laboratory to recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then inject the cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland says: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, as Prof. Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "attacking" them, like attacking cancer cells, has already worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tirade, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was fired from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a far-reaching performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", he wore a hat that read "Make America Great", lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people so often and I say, "How can you love Trump when he's a racist?"
So if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star jokes about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment charges by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's tirade was uploaded via social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether the Rock was trying to make fun of the West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had backstage problems with his head.
They were bullying me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with your head like that".
They bullied me!
And then they said I was a loser, like the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "You want to see the safe place?" followed by a statement that he would wear his Superman costume, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments were met with at least two rounds of public booing, and the SNL crew seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reports, with one person telling the publication: "The whole studio was completely quiet".
West replaced Ariana Grande at the last minute after her rapper Mac Miller died two days earlier.
West annoyed others with the performance of I Love It, which was like a Perrier bottle.
The West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the brave heads: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE HELPED THE MOB".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just watching who is going and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I do NOT choose to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or art) who I fear is spreading a harmful ideology that my community might like to do.
He is free.
But we are too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He is not the first to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the later music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and became the artist previously known as Prince.
Morduclo's trial for knife-picking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused will be arraigned in Belfast Magistrates' Court in the coming months.
The charges are being reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks male masculinity in a way that is harmful
Kit Harington is best known for his starring role as Jon Snow in the HBO horror fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often make young men feel they have to mimic the strong man to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of male violence in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits to being quite attached to the subject.
"I personally feel pretty strongly about the moment when we embark on the journey of masculinity", he said.
What did we teach men when they grew up, in terms of the problem we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of male-dominated masculinity, precisely because of its extremely masculine characters.
And again it is said: "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, that young men are supposed to be on the right side of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time, how do we change this?
There's definitely something wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to do a fourth or second Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he has had enough of "battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Kit is set to star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor once said that his wife Rose's character is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in your series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on, he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Yggdrasil, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at the request of Leslie's family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS has reached a 14% increase.
Health experts say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which makes a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health experts told a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of these transmission of diseases come from inadequate protection and relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that Matuarbecker leaked data from GOP senators, speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denied rumors that a member of her staff published personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims of "far-right" figures were celebrated on websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the leaked information were apparently private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identified the source of the submissions has a link to the Water Bureau, and they have released information about a member of the Water Board's staff, lawmakers told The Hill.
"These unsubstantiated claims are completely false and an absolute lie", Waters said.
The member of my staff  whose identity, personal information, and safety are at risk as a result of the dishonest and false allegations  had nothing to do with the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's comments quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote the butcher.
It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If you are judged to be a believer, do not be angry.
It is not to be defied.
Do not question the accusers.
It must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running against water in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In this statement, the water authority said that its office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials about these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are brought to justice", she said, "and that they are held accountable for actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my office".
Johnny English Strikes Again  slightly intoxicating Rowan Atkinson parody
It has now become a tradition to find Brexit references in all new British films, which does not seem appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action comedy-parody franchise.
Is this ironic self-satire, which clearly portrays us as stupid, worth this nation's export opportunity?
Either way, the glint-eyed and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his patent to screw it up a second time  his name says it all, and that is that it is a wide-ranging comedy creation aimed at non-English-speaking moviegoers in other territories.
He is, of course, a dumb secret agent who, while having a strange claim to idiot glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a bell of the type that was worn to the Chariots of Fire main event at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based on the traveling and international Mystery Man, who Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, and who left havoc everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this current Johnny English movie.
I was fascinated by the scene where Johnny English comes to a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades briefly clap against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor feels under-the-top and oddly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now want to offer more convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not adults, and to me Johnny English's silly misadventures just aren't as original and focused as Atkinson's dumb-ass sketch in the person of Bean.
The consistent current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret Internet spy network in the UK revealing the identities of all agents involved - a small role for Kevin Eldon, unfortunately.
It's the last drop that brings the barrel to overflow for the Prime Minister, a pompous and struggling figure who is already contributing to a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Theresa May character, but there's not much in the script that one could work with.
Here, intelligence officials inform them that every single spy is in danger of being forced to retire.
And that means the muttering Johnny English and person, now employed as a school principal by a distinguished establishment, but secretly teaching how to be a spy: some nice jokes here, English wants to set up a rock-art school of spy school.
English was sent back to Whitehall for a brief briefing in emergency and reunited with his old sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
Batman and Robin, who are all wrong, are back in action in the name of the intelligence service and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously compromised by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the grim Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and de Bough begin an odyssey of farce-making: dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they cause chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English leaves some anarchy behind as he tries to put on a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the sketches are certainly to be taken out for the latest sequence, but so friendly and burschikos everything is, it already has something of a children's TV in the big picture.
It's pretty mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that lives up to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain to introduce a four-day workweek, paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week but are paid for five.
The party seems to want the bosses of companies to return the savings they have made from the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have been paid the same amount on a three-day weekend.
Sources say the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and also align with plans to target the country in favour of the worker.
Switching to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way to give workers the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It is not something that can happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the employee and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first to advocate such an idea, the Greens had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
But this aspiration is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless dictators" and "profiteers" of supply companies.
The Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies would not be able to recover investments here if a Labour government could demand certain deductions for misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of companies and the so-called Inclusive Ownership fund to give 10% of the profits of private sector companies to employees who could then receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, told 60 Minutes whether Kavanaugh's investigation could change public opinion.
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could convince Republican senators to support him.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI had discovered anything new that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy worked more frequently than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I'm going, of course", Kennedy said.
As I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, this accusation came out, and honestly said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, determined, determined.
But Graham's devotion seems to be written in stone.
"My opinion of Kavanaugh is firm and there should be a particularly strong indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: The board vehemently denied it", Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone who calls them can verify nothing.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new that could change the situation.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This weekend, New York City is once again hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of performers, but with an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is expected to draw thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only see artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who go to the concert must complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, writing an email to a world leader, calling someone, or other tasks that help to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, with only 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way of asking people to take action or just another case of clicktivism  people who claim they would make a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has registered more than 11 million shares of its supporters' shares since 2011 targeting various causes.
They say that these actions have helped them to get global leaders to announce commitments and unlock policies worth more than $37 billion that will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and reports resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the money raised so far has impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key commitments is, among others, The Power of Nutritution, a UK-based partnership of investors and empowerers committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging  after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen  to give Rwanda $35 million to fight malnutrition in that country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Power of Nutritution Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced financial support for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to a FAQ on the website asking, "What makes you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's worth the long and hard road, but sometimes I fail.
But like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, if we are to succeed, we must be stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just some of the artists performing in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosting.
The US could use a naval blockade to restrict Russian energy exports  Interior Minister
Washington said it would deploy a navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, if necessary, as US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke betrayed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria  where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government  is all but a backdoor to exploring new energy markets.
"I think they want to be in the Middle East, they want to be in Eastern Europe and they want to be in Southern Europe, they want to be in the energy mix", he said, apparently.
And if you can believe in him, there's always a way to do it.
"The United States of America has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance  an American NGO that sees itself as the voice of the energy consumer.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia revolve, more or less, around exerting pressure and replacing fuels", he said, while in that context, he sees Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil fuels.
The claims come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, which is a significantly more affordable option for European consumers.
To this effect, Trump administration employees, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow if one listens to Trump.
Moscow has often claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current 110 billion cubic meter pipeline capacity, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for consumers to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn criticism from Germany, which has once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on America to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren should see if she can run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "look to God" if she ran for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our crappy government and that means a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will consider whether to run for president.
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he would be leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been open to criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that we need an FBI investigation before the election.
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that Warren's own voters did not want her to run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters believe she should not run.
Thirty-two percent thought it was a good idea.
The survey showed that there is more support for Vidrun's governor, Deval Patrick, with thirty-eight percent in favor of him joining and forty-eight percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision on whether to run by January, The Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD to the track Palin at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested last night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he got home, I can empathize with other families who are struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his firm "the elephant in the room", and said that her son and other veterans come back a little different, they're harder, they come back and ask if there's respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have contributed.
The following month, a man was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic battery against a woman, including reporting general domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Bennett, then a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal protection for a new U.S. policy that bans victims of gang violence or domestic violence from seeking asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the District have filed a memorandum amicus curiae (ami de la cour) in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She said that her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states where lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations with constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy would ignore state, federal and international law.
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be attributed to the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a court would be contrary to that principle", the judge said.
Advocates further argue in the memoir that the policy would not allow immigrants to enter, which would hurt the US economy, make them more likely to become entrepreneurs, and provide a "significant supply of workers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June called for judges to only grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy briefing on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems  even the serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly hopeless.
"It feels tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to calm her feverish baby at an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings in a body.
There is almost no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to destroyed houses, searching through decent properties for anything to save.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were crawling outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated for the ongoing noises.
When he told of the feeling of being on the fifth floor in a hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter, experiencing a violent earthquake, he was moved to tears.
It was not the time to save us.
I was kicked into the ruins of the walls, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's wrong with me or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement praising the benefits of mutual US-China trade in a US daily newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed a Chinese-funded advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after it accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in US elections is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, a US official said, according to Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise for trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a de-escalating trade war, which has led to higher tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to hit exporting states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa  a major exporter of agriculture to China  says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do the same.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now adding another layer to it by now placing propaganda ads in our free press.
By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is violating the long-held tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
In contrast, the newspaper stand down the street in Beijing has few opposition voices and is not worth finding a proper reflection of various views that Chinese people may have against the economic development of their country if the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He also said that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to print his article, but he didn't know which one.
Republicans are distancing themselves from women voters ahead of Kavanaugh's midterm debacle, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have come out in defense of various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a backlash in the midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions around the issue were extremely high, and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Things like this can't be undone", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation would only bring angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, to a Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
Friday's rallies saw protesters chanting "November is coming!" as they walked down the Senate aisle, while Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be extreme", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
People say it was high; it is true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called swing voters, in the inner city and young voters, 18-29 year olds, who -- even though they don't like the president -- often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she gave a detailed description of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that it could backfire if Republicans continue to push for confirmation.
"This is a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee voter or the last voter or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled it and how they treated them", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told a television station.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about what to believe from Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, although there is a tendency to believe the latter more.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had molested her while drunk at age 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup that was supposed to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who can access water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that his intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said about the start-up.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to record their own personal online data store or POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all sitting together in one browser, all the time.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is completely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, develop skills and appropriate to make such a solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few staff members working as developers on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized app here using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should introduce a complete change, where all of these business models are turned upside down overnight.
We're not asking for permission here.
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt's mission is to deliver commercial energy into an ecosystem that is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new Web on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World War I pastor commemorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to ever receive a Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War was commemorated in his home village for 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was captured by a sniper four days later and never managed to escape the highest British military rank.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by a group of his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his bop that cost him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through thick fog and under attack in the field and by machine guns.
He later ran to the line of fire and again commanded the battalion before taking a pistol with one hand and holding up three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was captured by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions could never be justified but it was a humbling experience.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he is honored to be part of the parade and said the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: You've been up all night looking at a packed Bellator 206, only to be turned down by the main property.
The schedule included 13 matches from San Jose, including six on the main stage, and was shown live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, just as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed, having stayed awake for the fight until the early morning hours.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government regulation that at 6am that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator's corporate president Scott Coker said they would review their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that if I think about the replay, I think we can probably do that", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. Sunday morning there and we're not able to fix this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
I'm sure when it was turned around, they sent a lot of messages back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But there wasn't one, there was a legal problem.
I can assure you, this time it will not happen again.
We're going to reduce the fight to five instead of six, like we always do, and we've tried to get more fans, but we've screwed up.
It is a deplorable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" in his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a leave of absence of several months due to illness.
During her appearance as an outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up he felt "less worthy" than everyone else because "it was not socially accepted to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of being less than and different from ourselves are the only things that have given us the strength and perseverance to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone if they found out his sexual preferences at the end.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is one of the most prominent LGBT advocates and he used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he said that he said it because he felt happy, able to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you're so young, you go through so much". He took part in his first Olympics at the age of one and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it was hard to find someone as old as him who went through the same heights and depths.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had their tickets to London 2012  because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I told you not to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invisible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there is no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song  Pride of Heather Small which he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused him a hangover.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sundays at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must regain his form to avoid an unfortunate mid-table.
Mickelson, who is playing in the event, which is held every two years, for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fours and fours on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day playing cheerleading and working on the range of his game, hoping to improve what he was planning.
Not even at the peak of his career was he the most reliable driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal fit for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the long rough routinely penalizes guided shots.
And if the tracks themselves aren't intimidating enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind in their 12 singles, get off to a rough start, Mickelson's match could prove to be crucial.
Furyk confided in her husband, and he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's on the best team list, and he's contributed to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I had more of an idea, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there like everybody else".
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really reached the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence has brought the team far more intangible benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to make fun of other people and he's a wonderful person who you love in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they were out with him, and this week, too, was fun.
It offers much more than just games".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows knows that a big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an awkward speech.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it was just a nose length win with 141⁄2:131⁄2 to go.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also just by a short margin", said Bjorn, declining after seeing the 2018 class win both Friday and yesterday by 5:3 to lead Le Golf National by 10-6.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
Give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see dots on the brim.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's what we have to keep focusing on.
I've said it all along, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side -- the best players in the world".
Relieved when his players beat each other on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
Tomorrow we have another beast before us.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that are going to be overlooked, and that's another pair of shoes.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out alone, you're tested to the limit as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give the players: Do your best tomorrow.
Now therefore send thy companion away, and let him go and bring his baggage.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big twists, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before they went out as losers as Europe played the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word of it", he said in response to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, collected his players before the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get off to a fast start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When the pendulum swings in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the center pole.
We have set our course accordingly, and we have put the people to sleep, as if we were ready to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the charge and faced Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European at the other end of the lineup.
"I chose this composition because I think it covers everything", Bjorn said of his single selections.
The new German warship is again moving to Hanne
The German Navy's newest frigate was ordered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not be completed before at least next year, according to local media, due to faulty systems and increasing costs.
The order for the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery have hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They have a high-powered gun, a suite of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible for the newest frigates to not reach the home port for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean that the innovative warships  that are supposed to prove Germany's offensive power overseas  are already obsolete before they even enter service, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 frigate that was haunted by the disaster made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the disengagement, but German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the ship unfit for combat.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of just under 120 sailors - just half the staff of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, which reduced its performance and the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project  including the training of the team  is also a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion)  from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly important due to recent warnings that the German Navy is losing its offensive power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "issuing the most capable ships".
The official said the problem has worsened over time as old ships are being laid up but no new ships are being delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study on a plot of land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flight mammals and help to develop guidelines for future conservation activities.
The study is being conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and follows common and Mecklanter mice but also brown long-tailed and daubenton bat mice at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out mobile recording using handheld detectors.
Funded expert analysis of all records determines the frequency of the mousetrap cycles and what kind of what.
A map and habitat report are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management efforts, such as the herds of wises and how best to care for woodlands for bats and other similar species.
The bat population has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom over the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and development work, which results in sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Wind and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fence and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attack from house cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to trapping prey.
They use a highly sophisticated echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes flatworms very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings, sleeping place inspections and occasional rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, providing a habitat for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal landscape for her.
"Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for flamingos", he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, and the work we're doing here and on other grounds will help us better understand what they need to survive".
He stressed the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance on land, as an unintentional destruction of a single breeding habitat can kill up to 400 female and young bats and potentially wipe out an entire local population.
Flatter mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to step up to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how to manage their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegation against him a "fake news" saying people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers want to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel for publishing the false claims.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to keep the incident from being made public, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, denied the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. This is a very good idea.
What they say today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They wanted to advertise themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy and very good man", the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue The Mirror for the false accusations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of suspicious privacy matters", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player wants to claim compensation for "moral damage with an amount that matches the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and the mayor allegedly went back to the player's room, where he had allegedly performed anal rape, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" except for "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that it was consensual.
The mayor also claims that he had gone to the police, and that he had photos of his injuries that were shot in the hospital, but had later agreed to settle the case à l'amiable because he had "great fear of reprisals" and feared being "publicly reprimanded".
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to have the union annulled because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged transfer and this summer he was traded to Italian top-flight club Juve in a £100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'may be forever preparing' to lose carmakers
The UK "would be prepared forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading carmaker, Economy Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant  where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "synchronously", with parts being ordered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a stockpile of more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus would stop production.
Mr Clark told Theresa May that her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid the checks at the border".
"We need a deal, we need the best deal, which allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The statement not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to lead what has been a very successful supply chain".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's union boss at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience I can say that once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting will be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "put off another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of solar advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating the case of possible Russian election interference, ties between Trump supporters and Russia, and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been the number one topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about being asked to record conversations with Trump and about the possibility of impeaching the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House and according to reports, he was able to get in there.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to "expose" Rosenstein, but the meetings were postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee's establishment, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, were both exonerated.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying an entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meetings, she replied: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week, it could be that I have to postpone it another week, with all the other things going on at the Supreme Federal Court.
But we still see that, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some reporters questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked about it.
Sanders felt that the lack of information sources did not stem from a dislike of television reporters who were "influence-haters", although she admitted: "I don't dispute the fact that they are influence-haters".
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be restored.
"The president holds more R&D sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without proof: "We looked at the numbers".
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, then that's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've done that a lot in the last few weeks, and that replaces a press briefing in the future when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public hearings or press conferences with speakers on a visit.
Press conferences alone are their soul.
In New York this week, the president may have proven why by giving a tongue-in-cheek and bizarre speech to the assembled reporters.
Health minister dismisses EU staff at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff from Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to stay on after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the cost of applying for a regular status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The summer has passed and the negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have progressed and are moving towards expected decisions for this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay".
Emergency surgery for Christion Abercrombie after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Mike organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"It came to the edge of the field and collapsed", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines and placed him on a beer and brought him to the dock for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the nature/scale of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a second-year college athlete, in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying land in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom, with the additional tax used under the Tory plan to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes Corbyn's campaign success in attracting young voters
Stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury experts expect it to rise to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, with the additional tax under the Tory plan being used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, attract young voters with promises, provide more affordable housing, and target well-off earners.
The stamp duty increase is charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money reinforcing the government's fight against sleeping on the streets.
The additional tax  in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second-time residents and buy-to-let homes  could threaten up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance experts expect the move to be worth £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving prices skyrocketing and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in housing.
Many wealthy areas in the country  especially in the capital  have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guideline comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying land but not using it, and he urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable homes to ease Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking array of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions "without blame".
He also wants to give the church more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would use my time as Prime Minister to revive the British Dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
It cannot be true that it is for non-UK residents, and also for foreign companies, to buy homes like British mansions.
For too many people, the dream of home is too far away and the degradation of sleeping on the streets remains far too real".
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to one day manage Scotland.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, who are currently in third place in League One, three points clear of the top.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Sport Sound Scotland.
"But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland games with my father in Hampden as a kid and that's something that always drew me back.
But the only way I could get that opportunity was if I was successful in the club administration".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success is measured by the question I ask myself: 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
"The club is a Premier League club, without a doubt, because of the structure and the equipment", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back there".
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from the Third Division and transform St Mirren from East Candidate to Championship winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real crossroads", he recalls taking over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was the right thing for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, but I've been doing well, I've been able to live well, and I've enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still do this because of the stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage, and now that I do, I feel like it's the best thing I've ever done in my entire adult life".

The perfect time to drink a pint is Sunday at 5:30, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for British pubs struggling to survive, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in July  but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, as the numbers show.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had 2.8 per cent more turnover, except that restaurants suffered even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in the recovery in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where drinking is done have decreased much more than the restaurants had.
Pubs and eateries have also suffered under the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go for a drink.
In all pubs and bars, sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales were down by three percent".
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales year over year is particularly painful in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, extremely hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food business operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much-needed breathing relief".
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including re-opening, rose 2.7 percent, also reflecting the slowdown in brand reopening.
The industry's sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses data from 47 operators groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion and is the established industry reference point.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children -- one in 11 -- has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a trend in fake Insta pages
The message fueled fears that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed their parents.
One in five children - a fraction of them - or 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-free website Instagram.
The message fueled fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would run a private "main account" that they would show their parents, even though they had a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager shouting, "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to running private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes "Athletes' Spokesperson" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the Board of Supervisors as a member of the Board of Supervisors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those practising the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in immense esteem in the athletics community across Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from us being on the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be acting as a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now a regular BBC pundit, can no longer walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk pumps that compare mothers to cows are making waves online
A milk pump company went online with an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked, arousing the thighs.
To promote the so-called "world's first unobtrusive dropper milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a non-serious music video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom that mothers  who pump milk  enjoy with the new pump.
Four real moms dance in a glass of cheese filled with hay to a music that includes the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm stroking myself, but you can't see my cock" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't ears, they're my breasts".
The choir continues, "Pump off, pump off, I'm feeding my babies, pump off, pump off, I'm wiping my ladies".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are taken away a few days after birth", wrote one.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use it to advertise a milk pump for mothers nursing their babies?"
Another added: "What a bad ad".
Others defended the ad, with one mother admitting she found the song "very strange".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still standing.
I felt like a cow through the pumps.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it exactly as it was intended.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad that targets mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pompoms placed in their briefs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is very inconspicuous, has no wires or tubing and fits discreetly into a seat cushion, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while pumped.
Ana Balarin, partner in ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breastfeeding and demonstrate them in a fun and tangible way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pomp has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mom for designer Marta Jakubowski ran across the runway while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a record high, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of children of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
"Just under 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are here illegally and a large proportion of those are criminal aliens.
We are continuing to track down the individuals", said Mr Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials, according to subcontractors, introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear to be using videoconferencing instead of in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for help are quickly deported.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, can lead to violent escapes or escape attempts.
Advocates have stated that these concerns are even reinforced in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs are more likely to be overlooked due to the facility's size, that a child is struggling with it.
They added that sending children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could make the trauma they are struggling with worse.
Syria demands that the US, France and Turkey withdraw their "occupation" immediately
Ahead of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country already being ongoing for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally present on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are "conducted accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as over", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus' "holy struggle will continue until we have cleared all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said conditions were in place for them to return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to ease these setbacks", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to push forward political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, home to three million people.
Al-Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and he expressed hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Visayas, who would be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon meet to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Al-Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the council's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ended his presidency.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
But so far there are no signs of mediation among the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million mainstream viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable ratings with no less than 3.5 million mainstream viewers.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, series creator of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a frequent comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
Remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos is worth entertaining.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the actions of the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get back together and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is beyond the comprehension of an informed citizen to sit for six hours watching a panel discussion of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" as the source for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 street singer bomber jacket (according to The Washington Post "a sign full of obesity") and Stormy Daniels's use of red-hot descriptions of his master, uh, Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes I used to.
"Part of what he does is make it feel like a reality show, that he's giving you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's show with rotating cast and daily unexpected conspiracies (when he's talking to the NFL, Kim Jong-un is praised).
You can't afford to miss a result, or you can't get any closer.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 90 degrees on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC and he was also picking up CNN.
He couldn't get away, not with Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
"I remember watching all those crazy shows and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money flowing out and the tightest midsummer balls for the race around the house
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a cash flow, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which have two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently added Pittsburgh suburb is at the expense of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb who won his seat in a by-election last spring in another district.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were re-assigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District has sparked a battle for campaign funding between the main campaign funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after narrowly winning a much-watched by-election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much opposition from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. officials from their diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against El Salvador were considered, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, which cut financial aid payments and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rate.
With progress in internal meetings, North and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from making their way to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made clear that they wanted the conference to be moved forward, effectively putting an end to any consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence must now host the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import that the administration is setting for the meetings, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further tense news or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was held by three US House of Representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on terms of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke on terms of anonymity.
Learning from History
Your next job message could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible disability, which is now being widely documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also seeking to investigate whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia to attack our election.
If Congress is reconstituted, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility for the reconstitution shortly before he has to appear again before the electorate, and perhaps even a jury of his peers.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is inevitable or that of his European counterparts.
We must all make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of this conflict.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West would only resist and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and didn't take the opportunity to prevent the years of massacre that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's relentless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of these turning points right now.
What do we do when Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he was secretly picking up the president and speculated that he was not up for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
What will be our response if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair  or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest statements against him?
And, most importantly, will we elect a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm?
If we do not overcome these challenges, bad times will come for democracy.
But I think we're not going to fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika on it.
With that in my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the rapid Vienna battle
Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna on Thursday are aware that the win over Austria, after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season since the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we knew something, and they came home with a point.
Maybe we would have known it by now, but, on the whole, a game is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we were the better side in the second half.
This Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels good now.
The squad is good and the boys are all having a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward and leave the last season behind and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed it with family members.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they would talk to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide, its life insurance company.
This is how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices play an important role in calculating costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices for paying for your long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts
Establish a health insurance proxy so that someone you trust can review your care and ensure that professionals honor your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You'll select a person you trust to make your financial decisions and ensure that bills are paid in case the door fails.
Remember the little details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List the details in a written plan so that the door is ready.
"It's not just about the money, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's looking after the dog?
So, have a plan in place.
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home after he left at night.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, lower body and hand.
Gendarmes described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian state of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Because of the collapse of communication facilities, official aid was unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Necklace mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis frequently in the past 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed about 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on a seismic fire cycle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and sparked destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaksa governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, failure to file a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released by a task force of Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away his phone.
Palin is in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He was a witness in court, where he declared that he was "absolutely not guilty" when asked about the guilty plea, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the brutal attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, possession of a firearm while intoxicated and reporting a domestic violence crime.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans groups for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social networks show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want the rare death penalty for NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who were in his path in the attack.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight people and "willfully" caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could lead to a possible death penalty, according to court records.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of aiding and abetting protection money laundering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and forethought", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of carrying it out as "cruel, violent and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigator that he was going to feel better about what he did, police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to envisage the death penalty, rather than a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to consider the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise a "people's army" during a protest at a Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces in bringing the deeply divided ranks back together has been highlighted by pro-Remain Tories who joined a separate Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping track of her Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers in the EU.
Allies insisted that the EU should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either its package or Chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was checking out the chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If I were to lead you, we would have been out already".
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we have to remove the checks".
To make his opposition to the EU clear, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people had changed their mind and wanted to remain was completely false.
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was also at the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and make sure that we get elected at all.
When I lift, checkers fall and start listening.
In a private message to Mrs May, it added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the heat" if they were to back down from the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now there is trust between us, the people and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to get past Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with it.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I am so sorry that our political class, which is about to leave Brexit, is feeling the heat.
We will mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us the victory over Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists carried Tories Against Brexit banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis had a falling out with the Conservatives over security concerns she had with a party app when the conference started.
'These are the people who tell us they know the IT systems and all the technology to install for Canada plus plus, for a smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland', he added.
It's a complete sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke to Samsden about her future during a speech at City Hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was the center of speculation that he would run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with the electorate in the City Hall format since he took office.
One participant asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our rotten government, and that meant a woman had to be in charge.
There was an arrest following the fatal shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Friday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the identity of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told Samshden media, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world championship title after the team time trial gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear that the Mercedes team line-up would play a big part in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the race ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost knocked Hamilton out while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his mate.
Vettel went into the pits first, leading Hamilton to drive the traffic to the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits a lap later and was behind the driver when he came out, but Hamilton took first after a wheel-to-wheel action as the Ferrari driver unintentionally released the rear wheel and risked waiting to defend the third corner after a double over.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then first for a majority of the race while holding his tyres to anticipate a quick finish and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth.
He eventually made it into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace in the final eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a one-two, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a joke of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally because she insisted that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and dishonest".
"That's one thing that could happen and that's beautiful what's been going on in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonorable", he said.
"If people see something that's going public and it's leaked and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer...you leaked the document - 2oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak.
But wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added, following the senator's vote.
Einstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Einstein denied knowing the leak from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked.
However, his denial did not go down well with the president, who commented during the rally on a samshden: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president, who went on to defend his Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, went on to suggest that the Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
They want to regain power by any means necessary.
They see the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they are, how they have to fight to gain power and control", media reports say the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars fought back in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two goals early on through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game before the Giants were up again due to Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured the win.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening was at 3:35 of the fourth minute from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game before Matt Marquardt equalized Cownie's at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first half when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he ensured they won with his team their fifth and final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Flying dies to make sure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape before an earthquake.
A flight attendant in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while trying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could land safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong winds continue to blow the area and many are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Allen Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly wobbly control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought it was going to collapse.
He died in hospital afterwards.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
The crew prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear this", he said.
Meanwhile, agencies feared the death toll could rise to thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to continue to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble while others cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
The military and air traffic controllers are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are populated everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is moving quickly to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete your tasks in the evacuation.
Are you ready?  CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says now a man is missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing after it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane as it was descending.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they were unable to accommodate a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boaters helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane floated while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agency said in a statement Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the event remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had crashed very low.
"That's an extremely good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through the hip-deep water to the safety exits of the plane as it was descending.
He said the stewardess panicked and shouted that he had suffered a small head wound.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working closely on improvements to a shipyard also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicated that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst retraces the time span of the night in which a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors have closed a summary of her case in a second investigation of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has spent hours testifying as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retracted for the jury how he used cellphone data to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of their deaths.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from many cell phone operators that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his claims of one, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sandford.
Sandford had a joint, claiming he had not been in town.
When investigators asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going to lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers's texting, calling and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He's been wiped out of his life", said Hale.
It is planned that the defense will begin to make their final arguments.
The judge told him he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed What is Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and consciously make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in popularity in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY school girl fucks couple for firing after racist text message
A New York City nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong-addressed text message from the mother complaining that she is "still black".
The couple denies being racist, and liken the complaints to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEW YEARS AFTER A BLACK", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After noticing the fake pass, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that the nanny who had just left, an African-American, had done a poor job and that he should have expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and expects compensation of about $350 per roof for the six-month job he would have lived in the house he was originally hired for, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", said a Postman on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back against claims that they were racist, saying it was the reasonable decision to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing they would not be able to trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
Hat is not a racist.
We are not racist people", the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would your children be in the hands of someone who is rude, even if it was a wise thing?
Your newborn baby?
There.
Plasco said that while comparing the complaints to "blackmail", his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Is he going to run after someone like that?
This is not a nice way to do business", the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, tearing them apart for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington editors feared that readers might not relate to a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it first before it's published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's success.
It said his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been angry if his work had not been accepted, adding that the books' 60th anniversary would have been "sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who describes it as "a very important family member", it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a person who broke himself", they said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like someone who had accomplished something: one is really proud of it even if it's not one's own creation.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called many times to say it would look very bad, that it would not be expected to succeed", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from the priest to tell him that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm right there.
I'll be with that.
The medication the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating was slowly wearing off and leaving his system.
He had died a short time before, and that was just the end.
I should just sit there and wait, knowing that all this stuff is happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation with families and people.
I really should be getting my act together.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was in mourning over the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with the other passengers, not knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew anything", she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears flowed continually.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an immense sympathy for the needle.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women in mourning send suicide prevention cards to bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for support, near a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at age 18.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel all over the place", he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a wry grin.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would stick in any room.
However, he left his job before he died, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly making sure that there are consequences.
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still  you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything like that", it said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
Christmas was coming to an end, and as the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
It said his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to come to terms with it: "There is a laughingstock throughout the family.
It's dragging us apart.
But we must all keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could really get something like what he asked for  a time-limited inquiry, with a limited scope  then maybe we could achieve some unity", Mr. Flake told Samschden, adding that he was afraid the committee would "fall apart" in a entrenched partisan stance.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating?
Their aversion is entirely to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their bid to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to pass a parity and appeal to the Supreme Court.
North Korean survivors are falling under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors heading to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the Ministry of Unification in the south and said there were 1,127 survivors last year  compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher costs of human trafficking would play a big role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the survivors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that, since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flights are made through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea  who are technically still at war with each other  have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization talks.
This follows the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm first unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court in his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments to Samshden in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would have said 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has alleged that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers struggling emotionally.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly yelling or choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational assassination campaign" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statements proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he ran against the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed concerns when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was sworn in, and whether the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying here that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but he's unfit to be on the court where he is", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative justice.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then expect us to say 'this is not amazing,'" Pelosi said.
And women must practice it.
It's a righteous hatred, months and years of anger that overflows, and has not gotten it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", I told Mrs. Stein 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?
She goes on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere who said that she would cry if she got angry, but that she developed a technique, which means that if she got angry and started crying, she would then say to the person she was talking to, "You probably think I'm being faithful because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that would be brilliant.
Tears are partly allowed as a vent for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my previous job, in a predominantly male office, where I was crying my eyes out with indescribable anger, was that an elderly woman took me to the curb -- a cold manager I was always a little afraid of -- and pulled me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", we said.
"They don't know that the rose is.
They will see that you are sad and will rejoice when they see you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought it was time to consider not running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
And the name of the beast was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the campaign, it was behind on fundraising, so it vowed not to enter the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a battle that was already lost.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men $1000 gave him only $250.
How much will I get for a discount?" he asked himself.
When he gave his speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed with feelings - gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters and non-delegates, and anger at sexism - that it cost him his voice.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown", Ms Schroeder recalled her reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first waves of the US-China trade war have been a blur, and while the fight is far from over, a break between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired off the first warnings earlier this year by imposing tariffs on a major Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming from China into the US.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to join the U.S. in a shootout, and the world's second-largest economy will not be pushed so quickly.
If they want to stop Washington, they have to comply with demands, but publicly belittling the United States would be too much of a disgrace to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, US pressure in the trade war with China could be a long-term positive because it would reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could trigger an economic whirlwind in both countries is ultimately far more dangerous than viewers have realized", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Asia-focused think tank Center of New American.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who want to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place to allow the return of refugees who wish to return to the country and who have been forced to flee terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe finishes with Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA have now lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for much of the tournament, shot his tee shot into the water at par-3 of the 16th hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with 5&4 by the worst player on the European team's ranking, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most all-time victories of the tournament with 25.5 as a career.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful for Thomas for taking me along and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in beating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
It was moments before the morning when we showed Europe our fire.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were overwhelmed.
