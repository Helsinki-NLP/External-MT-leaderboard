28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother testified that he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Finally, he's back on track".
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Forensics Department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team working as a close family and we will miss him terribly", the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally got better for him".
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend", Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, to make us dinner", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"Of all the things that go wrong in the world, he was this unpolished diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.
Anyone with information on the case is requested to call the SFPD's hotline at 415-575-4444.
I'm always stuffed in drawers.
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made that clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels from outside that have little to do with me and reality".
"I myself do not desire to be perfect and successful all the time".
"Honestly, I'm a little bit into these things".
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The magazine says that the actress prefers to spend her time at home, watching TV, eating loose food and Mexican food.
They are excited about the question of wanting children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect", says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is Not a Child's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown on August 25th.
Golfers are getting the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is understandable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a trip to the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
The "Golden Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer is now in the hands of CHIO
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, and they galloped home to the feeders.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience", says Langer.
And that was the end of the riding again.
On Saturday, Germany's all-time leading golfer - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.
He was led along with his family through the ALRV plant, not even on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was first in Aachen and then at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid awarded the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not short of awards.
Cross of Merit, Silver Leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...
Even the British Queen has ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me", says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment".
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bobsledder Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company marched to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was held.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policies compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
The two US presidential candidates, however, disagree on tax and energy policy and on a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubts low and warns of how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will be making a massive cut in regulations and advocating far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates for individuals and businesses.
Clinton says the government has a job to do, it has to give opportunities to the disadvantaged, and it needs money to do it.
That's why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close on the subject of infrastructure.
It must be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost in the same words.
The Democratic candidate is announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
Government investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the Republican Tea Party wing, which is critical of the government.
So Trump could be the subject of some party-wide debate.
The differences between energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
He also called for the creation of a European Union of the European Parliament and the European Parliament.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energy explicitly through her investment programme, and she calls for "a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs".
"It's either China, Germany or America - I want us to be".
But not only in the area of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements - the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, they both refuse to sign.
At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, Clinton says.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says the minimum wage must go up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the great debate of the coming months is likely to revolve more around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the people to stimulate growth.
His critics say it will only make the budget deficit worse.
On the other hand, Clinton wants to at least demand that the rich pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the answer either.
Escape: "Every female refugee has had experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house is a place of refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each carries a baby, one year old at the most.
One of them put her little boy in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until they talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a social welfare organisation in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single women refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on the run", says Bahr.
"Men flee wars because of political persecution, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope", she says.
For women, other reasons predominate: "Many people sneak away because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced prostitution, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them.
It's still going on on the run.
"It is not uncommon for traffickers to demand sexual intercourse for a bottle of water", says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that the end will come when they arrive in Germany is deluded, Bahr tells us.
Here too, single women in refugee camps were often treated as inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
This results in about 90 percent of the women living in the shelter in northern Munich being traumatized, she estimates.
"I'm sure some of the children were not born of their own free will".
Many women are so used to it that they don't say anything.
"Or they don't dare to talk about their experience openly because the shame is too great".
Since they often cannot help themselves, more accommodation is needed just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a similar project in their area of competence as in Munich, some would answer no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some communal housing units have floors or separate houses for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately".
"If there is no privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be - continuing - violence against women".
In particular, the bathrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, says the study.
The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen from the pressure on the house in Munich.
"Since we were first mentioned, we've had a long waiting list", says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Medical assistants strike: demands for new strike measures
The representatives of the medical assistants have called on their union to approve new strike measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its full council to approve more strike action from the beginning of September.
The JDC testified that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
In July, medical assistants and medical students voted against a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "consistently silent" about problems, which led to the contract being rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has requested formal renegotiations of all your concerns.'
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating strike action, which begins in early September.
The dispute led to six general practitioner strikes this year, the first total strikes in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election, rejecting the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 medical assistants and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced by force.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help but get the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yeah.
But Putin's smile seemed to be narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his reserved attitude.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a persistent coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin divided and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild trust.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestrained attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, the only reason this meeting took place was because Putin got the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to score a kind of victory.
The advantages of a ceasefire are clear to Ankara.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get first and foremost after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They're counting on an off-season storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it sees its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to this the persistent resentment over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to take advantage of the cooling mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, as one analyst once described to me, to represent an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West and are now allied.
Yet, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently offered itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even touched the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator for Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been distancing itself since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock exchange listings will be transferred to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will gain more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands".
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their own communities, and our people will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become a bank of brands, because how are we focusing internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we'd be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, with our focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you're going to see a lot of change.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori has made his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection .
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone for Predilection, trained by John Gosden, at his local racetrack with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Dettori, who won three times, and who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot -- it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori records the cheers as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the hurdle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that few have before him.
He's got style and he's strong, but it's his tactical intelligence that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthralling fans of this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and major-league jockey!
Frankie's been racing in Britain for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-racking.
A string of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had initial difficulties when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And it's not over yet - Dettori once said he wanted to keep competing until he was at least 50.
Russia's Putin fired chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin's closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said that Putin "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as the head of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason".
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
He was the head of the Russian government's security forces.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in drafting legislation and checking the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has made Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was a longtime close confidant of Vladimir Putin and like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that I asked you in an interview at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - a burdensome post for four years.
It turns out I've been the head of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat up producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement his resignation.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On set, there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident", he said in a statement.
Details on how to write the character Gibson from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have poured my heart and soul into it for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there till the end, but that's not going to be possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all, the best fans you could ever want for a show.
The twelfth season is scheduled to air on September 28.
Riddles about fish that landed in Banff's garden
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals spat out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 yards from the ocean, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four "roof blower" closures that are nearing completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country onto the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the seal between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate task requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge decks are in place and the final section of the deck is being cast concrete for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the enclosure represents a landmark in high-rise construction.
After installing the last section of the road deck and connecting it to the northern deck of the tower under construction, we had to close the gap on the northern or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
It's delicate, because the tolerances the team is working towards are tiny -- a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat spinning around nearby and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, head of the Moelfre rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of range before we could set sail", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat's engine had an emergency stop line, but it was detached from the person steering the boat when the boat was being towed.
Someone was watching over those men today.
Man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
Police said yesterday that the 50-year-old was given the key to his apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunken perpetrator tore up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
The nurse then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old tried to calm her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
So she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-partner.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds affordable housing in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be much more committed in the future.
How do we react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 affordable housing units in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a 'living action plan' at the next Council meeting.
But fighting is programmed.
First of all, it is a question of who is going to build the affordable housing.
There is no regulation yet.
The Socialist Group's chairman Christoph Bratmann says: 'We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, you will have to register 20 percent of all housing as social housing in the future.'
However, the cheapest housing can also be created in the stock.
The main point of dispute in the City Hall, however, according to Bratmann, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing on such land as social housing".
A new housing subsidy programme for urban areas, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is expected to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann, is that "there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment".
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left still wants tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the housing market was beginning to deteriorate.
The implementation of the action plan will create additional tasks for the construction administration.
More personnel are needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet complete: the 1260 new dwellings, which should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of some 1,300 more affordable housing units which will be exhausted in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, the city should buy up expiring bonds now.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the new rules are implemented.
That's possible in the West Town.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Because the deadlines in West City are running out at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-fixing for affordable housing.
Only the owners, the housing companies, they don't want it.
The number of social housing units in the West Town is again increasing dramatically, and this is a step away from the goal of so-called mixing.
The concentration of the socially weak in a few districts is no longer to be expected.
The Greens expect that there will be some movement in the debate.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The Commission has concentrated on more single-family housing sites.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a rewarding hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens has been a subject of much complaint over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting them to be more active.
Screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games, and finally smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go Delusion, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later evolving into a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the game declined slightly before its release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the madness and jumped off the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes each day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked who exercise 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go -- it's just looking at the raw data for performance improvement.
Many public health education campaigns that try to get people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have been met with deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game-winners who always have to complain about something.
And, yes, someone could run into a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish with time.
But because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles is making gold at the Dementor
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easy on the beam.
It's amazing on the floor.
Brilliant all the way.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in full view of the Olympic spotlight.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States is performing on the swing beam during the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a mixed martial arts title and the fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even of all time.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as exceptional athletes like Michael Phelps, who has taken their sport to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with exercises so amazing, combining ambition and precision, that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
She was facing a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-sized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, USA, hug after winning gold and silver in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving as a cheerleader at the retirement of team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long run to the top, that she never planned for the future, that's not really true.
Some of her floor exercises - which include her typical tumbling pass - are tuned to Latin music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a mixed martial arts event since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture carried.
Swing beams and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She caught up with 15,433 on the swing beam again - and put another one on it with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman embraced them gently as they awaited their end - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Biel's glittering red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, known to Americans as "Grandma", had a head start.
After her floor practice, she threw a handshake to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet from the 19-year-old earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer, while they were talking in their car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in four months in predominantly Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house", Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect used multiple vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
One witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't go along with it.
Which is not true at all -- of course you've gotten into it", she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people still did that,'" explained Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with assistance.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has invented for "Please sing me something".
"We are teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not your typical sign language -- she says.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, as in Edmund, and infections with viruses such as measles or Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding, and rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have flooded their banks, threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone would have requested 10,000 sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place over large swathes of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service has announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood early warning system was put in place in southern Alabama on Friday, while rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as the rivers that have been trampled will slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded as early as 9:00 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in", said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she had lived there, she had never seen such a rise in the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members were all disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that first responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as heavy rainfall continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly saturated by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rainfall and flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school attendance was cut short in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a Tangipahoa resident reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
City manager Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to recede, they will be able to return to their homes", he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take with them, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the Harrison County emergency manager, said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", said Townson, "and it's still coming".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "shot through the head", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week a 6-year-old boy has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the waist, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was assessed in a hospital as critical and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, and the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether the perpetrators could be under one of the wounded men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a crossfire between multiple shooters.
Stormtrooper shells traced to various assault rifles were sewn across the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on either side of the sidewalk, there were shells.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved", Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit on the arm by a crossbow while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine the women's gymnastics team is, and for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been more dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been an inspiration to many young girls of color.
The structure of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American woman to win gold in an individual women's mixed martial arts event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're seeing the pinnacle of this sport, but that's not what gyms across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They're the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gyms run by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel expenses (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
These clubs provide the gymnasts with all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been training their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make it more affordable and accessible for communities and countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to get physical training.
I started my 20-year-old gym foundation.
At my events, we've provided free and affordable gyms in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gyms for youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Exercise develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that's got thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by winning Olympic Team Gold, and thank you, you're motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to begin their journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Physician assistants want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 physician assistants who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying the NHS was in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract which will include changes to night and weekend work to improve care at uncomfortable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Committee on Medical Assistants, said in a statement last night: 'Physician assistants continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.'
With only eight weeks left before the first batch of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks were met with reluctance from the government to participate and sometimes deafening silence.
This happened with a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, end the enforcement and address the concerns of the paramedics".
If he does not, the paramedics have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further strike action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike mail chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better weekly pay for the 54,000 paramedics who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, called on the paramedics to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work strike measures do little to strain already overworked teams and providers and create nothing but worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families".
In the last two months we have spoken to the Committee on Medical Assistants and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to respond positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a work break, training kits, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 a day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after authorities have recommended giving it to more people over a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year follow-up to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year follow-up to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form the lining.
If the lining breaks, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The NICE draft guidance released today recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg of ticagrelor followed by 60 mg with twice-daily aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have had another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous results".
The fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political correctness culture allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year following a government report on corruption.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivities about ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barricades outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, all a voter has to do is state his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink be applied to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of a simulation where one person votes for someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent ballot - where senior members of the Muslim community had pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping IDs to prove identity
The report states: 'Evidence has been provided that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions may have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop "voters".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and welfare fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once they've cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that he is eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic by-election.
Prohibition of political activists from editing complete ballots and ballot envelopes.
The police are authorized to set up barricades around polling stations.
A change in the law to facilitate a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photographs allowed in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure staff are enforcing the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls for the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for service due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds which are sufficient to meet the high standards of criminal procedure.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the city halls.
Sir Eric said: "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's biker doubles and other famous doubles of Rio Olympics athletes
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were stunned this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-winning athlete this summer to have her own famous double - at least not if you're to believe the social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. Archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the bike racetrack, many people on the Internet were pointing out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-list celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. team archer Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter buzz after images surfaced that show him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer caught the craze on social media and admitted that he's been told since he was a child that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except for the facial hair", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm gonna take that as a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into focus this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is set to go through as a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step further: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than sun-tinted skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attributed by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar facial features and eyes
Not only that: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's resemblance
One Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical".
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, which resembles that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth-place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the Dr. 4x200m freestyle swimming relay angered viewers of CBC's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like a monkey" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinion at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more "color", could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a bee, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final of the women's 4 x 200m freestyle swimming event as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her touch, baby".
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came swiftly and harshly, with many calling him out
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald. I'm not going to be the first person to say that.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance".
It was an unfortunate choice of language, and we're sorry it happened".
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the comment via Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russell was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apology with more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized last night to our viewers on the show and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance and not her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of wording.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show, trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming team on the CBC Olympic broadcast", he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person".
Of course, I didn't mean to be rude, and I'm very sorry".
Shopper at Primark outraged over woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of store
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primary market to try on underpants.
To make matters worse, she sampled the inside of it, took it off, and put it back on the shelf.
She went on and tried on four pairs of underpants at a store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she put on her clothes again and left the store without buying anything".
She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own stockings and trousers, and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, brazen like Oskar".
"Everyone stared as she pulled back her underwear, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf".
She repeated the same thing with three more panties before finally deciding she didn't like it, getting dressed again and walking out.
"She didn't seem to mind being watched - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried on".
Mrs Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that another person was wearing and that hadn't been washed".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'As I understand it, the staff tried to pull the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as well.'
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had them on and then undressed them and they weren't washed".
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident which took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone".
All eligible products were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the New York Krav Maga Association, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your predator.
If someone approaches you from behind, turn around first so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire", says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then, with your knee, strike the groin, twist, while the attacker bends in pain, the gun out of his hands, strike him in the face with the running, and move backward as you point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip before you move backwards and aim the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, the safest way to handle a robbery is to hand over your money, unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright is giving a tour guide a tongue-in-cheek look at Europe's dirtiest places
A British traveler put his immune system and choking reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-based presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, used a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet seat on a train, and a public telephone in Russia to prove his immune system's resilience.
Before he'd smeared each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was about to get involved in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought to light some surprising results.
The thought of licking the washing-up button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his European tour Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to toilet flush buttons, the task put his immune system to the ultimate test.
In the film, he said: "Even as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health, and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, soil, worms, and muddy water".
He certainly lived up to his reputation in the film.
The only thing he turned down was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample print showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was one Russian toilet he refused to flush after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places, such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything in here, because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company is providing Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, VALIO's Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, says: "We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming, which ended with us saying, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context -- the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film".
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to seduce her and others where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of these dirty treats on film".
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach and intestinal health in particular, and 58% said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.
An asocial family destroyed before deloging social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social housing after a eviction with £50,000 in damage because they had terrorized their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown off their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing associate employees found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls were riddled with gaping holes, wooden panels were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she is now living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, who works for the Housing Authority at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that the apartment was beyond repair.
She said, "It's been an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered a less than beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and so is its reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror inflicted on the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, fighting, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish has been found
The wooden parts of the estate, which was used to deal drugs, were torn down
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting in the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an 11-week extension to move out voluntarily.
The eviction was cheered on by relieved neighbors who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One witness said: "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we tell the police here is unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning".
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, testified that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Trash and old toys were thrown down the overgrown side of the town hall
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to take any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as a delogement is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors to witness.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community have done, who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope this development will provide some comfort to neighbors and send the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogement
House management workers will now have to clear garbage piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to distribute.
She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private home in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were graffitied.
Police say they're going to evict tenants who don't follow house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who do not respect house rules.
"This is for those who think they can behave without self-blame and for those who have been harmed by such behaviour", she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet flew over a beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane has made an incredible crash
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in close proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped off when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew twice really very low and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me".
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the Air Force insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
This summer, fires have devastated parts of the Portuguese mainland, including four deaths on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke from the fire - that his vision was limited.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight for the first step towards winning their first title in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans will face Sevilla in a match for the Spanish Super Cup, and the second leg will be played three days later at the Camp Nou.
The double winner must forgo Neymar, who is competing with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, in the match with the defeated cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion.
And the goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a sprain in his knee during training, which at least for the time being resolves the objection in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one spot in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from a clear decision on this and has left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen has the lead in most of the other bids.
Before the first match of the new season, the Spanish champions are in doubt about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated in a 0-4 test match against Liverpool on Saturday.
Even at 3:2 in the trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convincing.
Sevilla, on the other hand, have to digest the 2:3 defeat in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid after extra time and are aiming for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven wins so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own for table tennis gold
The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic champion in table tennis.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
This earned him the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and the Olympics.
The bronze went to Jun Mizutani of Japan.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and won the title against each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the singles title under the Five Rings sign.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic ladder was former SVS-NO Legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the board, between sets and time-outs, they didn't have coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their patrons to fight each other in a fair competition.
"All the matches I've played so far, I've played for my country".
"I'm playing for me in the final", Zhang had said.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the plate and gave Zhang only 13 points.
Ma's superiority did not turn out to be the expected exciting match.
Nevertheless, there were enough stunning ball swings to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov by 4-1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dmitry Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths at similarly high table tennis ages.
Donald Trump admits to "huge problems" in the election campaign
The Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority in even traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually bountiful and self-assured multimillionaire expressed something like concern, correspondents reported.
After eliminating 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are growing about his success in the race for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah", Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Due to false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media reputation.
Republican strongholds are shaking
Utah is usually a safe haven for the Republicans.
A survey by SurveyUSA in June found Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on par.
Other institutions may be looking to Trump, but not at the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to a question about how he would stop Clinton's advance: "Just like I've done before".
And then he said, "This is going to be a success, or I'm going to have a very, very long vacation".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.
Then I'll go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party threatened to cut off funds to support his campaign if he could not present better poll scores.
Instead, they want to take a stronger hold on the Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympic: Bold cheating at doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athlete is threatening trouble after the second doping incident at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After an attempted cheating at a doping check at the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee has announced that it will immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had submitted a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent action of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment", an IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and impersonated Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it", explained Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich was fourth at the 2015 Beijing World Championships over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been suspended from the Rio Games.
He is alleged to have been informing athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for cash.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time following numerous doping offences.
Unusually, when the IOC announced the more than 2000 doping control targets set for the Rio Games, it was pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be particularly targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 Beijing World Championships.
In a series of ARD television reports, accusations have been repeated that doping is readily available in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was established that this sport was extensively and systematically doped.
Russian athletes were subsequently banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli and the
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical takes Salzburg: the "West Side Story", the masterpiece of Leornard Bernstein.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classics and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he exclaims.
We always say it's very Latin.
There's a lot of Latin in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with sadness her love affair with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
First, because it is exceptional musically!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course, she's also naive, and she's very passionate.
"She's very much like me, my Italian character as a Roman", laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist".
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli replies with the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in every move, in every look, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important.
For American director Philip W. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly topical: "It is about prejudice and fanaticism".
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
These are the same themes, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, several weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England, according to her family.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then boarded a bus bound for the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says Clinton will stay on as a Supreme Court nominee if he wins Garland.
Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expected Clinton to choose Garland "with some degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he hadn't spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't cause any trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "women and men".
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muse calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the timeless and classic depiction of nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community faces mass flight
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on a packed suitcase", says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees to flee Turkey to Germany in the near future.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, the association's president.
Because of the harsh actions taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition", Ali Toprak, the head of the association, told Welt on Friday.
The government has already been overrun with criminal gangs in Kurdish strongholds for months, and 500,000 Kurds are fleeing inside Turkey.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks joined in.
Many people in Europe will want to start over if they continue to be repressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees is producing refugees in its own country", Toprak said.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also Alevi cities.
This is what Erdogan is trying to do to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years", said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the Federal Government "stand as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" is underway against Erdogan's critics.
For the first time in months, I don't feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The brand of Gülen supporters destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, even the Kemalists and secularists", Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Dialogue and Education Foundation, told Welt.
The newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, that even before the coup, the Turks had the largest group of asylum seekers admitted to Germany because of political persecution.
As of 30 June, this figure was 11,386 people, or almost 29 per cent of all those recognised as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.
The only persons entitled to asylum under the Basic Law are those who are persecuted individually for political reasons, i.e. by the State.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't know about the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament of Sweden has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not going to be any dumber than it has been: summer holidays, heat and a parliamentary campaign - that's a bit of a hassle.
The locals, who are being convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers in the country, whether they are travelling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local residents, so they cannot vote for the parliament.
There are practical problems too: During the holidays, it is difficult to find helpers who hang posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count the votes.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let the people's election campaign pass by.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in opinion polls.
It's going to be interesting to see how much the new AfD is cutting and what's left in the end for a coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and prime minister since 2008, is running a campaign that seems almost unremarkable, apart from his large posters.
He travels the country, handing out roses and chatting with people, just as his legendary, wordless predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flourishing of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, your "we can do it" policy has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him his beautiful office.
The CDU, with its leading candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time and in the right place.
It has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the north-east.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalians, Berliners and Saxons than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommerners.
"The majority were probably from other federal states", complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the GDR.
But it does not hurt anyone else in Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely abstains from the usual polls in marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, is only a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are destroying the base in the countryside, that it has to work very hard to find a way to get back to the people.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: you are scarcely present in the vast country.
The advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his fellow candidates is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because of the stakes, Sellering has now called for a particularly committed election campaign by his SPD.
In the most recent polls, the Social Democrats were 22 per cent behind their counterpart the CDU (25) and just short of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 elections, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent over the CDU (22).
The Greens, a minor party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the parliament.
They're turning the holiday crisis into a modern virtue and moving their campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", the country's president Claudia Müller called it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are going to look for local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is cruising the lakes of Mecklenburg with a houseboat and she thinks it's beautiful.
Your impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 - Restoration: restaurants are being closed
The speed with which the B27 is being restored is not to be complained about.
The construction workers, who start at 5:30 a.m. and end at about 8 p.m., are widely praised.
"They made everything pretty messy", says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet-fueling station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay, either. I'm not going to.
The construction site could be moved south at the beginning of the week at halftime as planned, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The work of those responsible for the construction work, such as the setting up of access roads, is also commended.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted, and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, traffic within the town has been relaxed.
The citizens can now drive from the B27 offterdingen on both sides of the road.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be decreasing.
"There were some serious complaints", says Florian King, deputy head of the headquarters responsible for the technical management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many people sought sneak paths and trusted their ship rather than the signage.
Which led to some trucks being driven into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant oversteps", says King, who was able to learn about the situation himself.
There's been two or three lightning strikes a minute.
The fastest was going 77 miles an hour in the speed zone 30.
But since the construction site moved on, it's been quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at cards.
But the fact that the B-27 repair has led to a decline in their sales is beyond anyone's comprehension.
However, some are more affected and some less.
If you have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, the repair will have little effect on you.
The Commission has also been asked to assess the impact of the new measures on the environment and the environment.
The most heavily polluted are the shops along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That's already life-threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants were "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were absent.
We must be happy with every euro of turnover.
He estimates the losses in sales at "well over 50 percent".
The road improvement project "has thrown back two years" of his business.
He had to lay off half his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were laid off, the policy would have been different.
Instead, when asked by Mr Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, the Prime Minister, Mr Jörg Schmidt, replied that the pub would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the B27 location and would now have to bear the disadvantages of the renovation.
Göhner knows of other counties where this has been handled more generously.
Göhner is sure that his restaurant will survive.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand why other regulars are now less likely to stop by because of the complexity of the transportation system.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular client will return after the renovation works.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction works on his customers to be the greatest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's rough.
There's a lot of legislation being screwed up in the name of counterterrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a massive security package.
But what does tolerance have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière is the one who makes the reconciliation.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more detailed points would be discussed first within the parties.
I'm in on that too.
As Minister of the Interior, he was concerned about results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has allowed some time to pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions on the security of the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, and targeted: That a new security agency should be tasked with cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and staffing for the security agencies is also not surprising.
The Commission is also proposing a second round of proposals, which have not been possible with the SPD: it wants to punish the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to block the German passport of jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and does not demand anything which has no chance with his coalition partner.
De Maizière also presents some new ideas.
They have it in them, in part, that he's planning expedited deportation procedures and more ways to detain people before they're deported.
Refugees who are brought into the country on a targeted basis are asked to have their smartphones checked and to disclose their social media accounts for security checks.
In terms of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than they have been - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally sensitive.
Some of the questions remain unanswered and leave questions.
And at some points, for example, the inequality of treatment of patients, the question arises: What does this have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to deny that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about their safety in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about, they couldn't just leave out during election campaigns.
Domestic security has become a huge focus.
First, the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And, yes, there are campaigns.
The European Union and the SPD are therefore taking an increasingly active position on the subject of internal security.
The last few days have been a heated affair between the two parties.
First a heated debate over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy meeting of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a ban on the burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to find some conciliatory tones.
He doesn't think it's a good idea to get away from the double.
We have settled the dispute in Germany.
It's not worth opening them again.
And he has constitutional concerns about a burka ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional on all sides and whether it is indeed "reasonable" for the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There's a lot of stuff in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also trying to make a name for itself on the subject of internal security.
The SPD is ready to discuss anything that will help to increase security.
Volkswagen is still going to be a little bit of a breeze.
Despite the diesel scandal, deliveries are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets are doing it.
There is a certain confusion about the recall.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest carmaker has been able to continue to show an upturn in the course of the year, despite the diesel business, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core VW brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, again weighing on overall sales, as the Dax-listed company reported.
The VW brand sold 449,100 cars worldwide in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second largest market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous month.
In Germany, the domestic market saw a drop of almost one sixth in deliveries.
The lower sales figures in July were mainly due to two fewer sales days in Europe, said Jürgen Stackmann, head of brand sales.
In addition, there was a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to 'changing economic conditions'.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been a burden, a spokeswoman said.
In the United States, where the emissions issue first escalated, the downside is still to be seen.
VW's main supporter is the Chinese market.
The mainly affected brand in the Netherlands is still suffering from the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a 0.9% drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles is recorded.
Fred Kappler, Group Sales Director, continued to show a surplus in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in that period, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust emissions tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is recalling around 2.5 million cars for conversion.
In the course of the restructuring, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issues the customer a "guarantee equivalent" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as was said in company circles on Friday.
The reason was legal.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen was now giving its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday.
The Department of Transportation has confirmed that this meeting took place.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA".
"Devisions from this are not accepted", said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has undertaken to ensure that there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion and that all vehicle type-approval values remain unchanged.
The term 'guarantee' is not used by Volkswagen itself, as was claimed in company circles.
In the broad term 'warranty', Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers might come to a workshop, for example, six months after the conversion with an engine failure - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the failure has nothing to do with it.
It is also in the interest of the customer to avoid any uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements in the event of any other damage not related to the exhaust gas scandal.
That is why VW does not use the term 'guarantee'.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is the second bank in Germany to charge penalty interest to wealthy savers.
Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who have 40 million euros in current or daily money accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and sees no signal that normal savers should "not fear paying penalty interest on their savings".
If banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay it a penalty interest of 0.4 percent.
This fee is to be recovered by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 in current or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free".
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year", Paul said.
He has been saving 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn overnight and which he cannot use.
"They're in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent", the bank manager said.
"I can't put down 4,000 euros for every million".
The costs will be passed on under the polluter pays principle.
Leaving the cash in the vaults of Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've seen four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank's board.
Most clients would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association Bayern stated: 'The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance is causing significant costs for all banks'.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits of over three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, because competition among banks and savings banks is far too strong in Germany".
One banker said that there was "a clientel of a somewhat more luxurious fortune" on Lake Tegernsee.
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association Bayern "is not currently aware of any other banks charging a deposit fee for deposits from private customers", said Spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German National Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative vis-à-vis the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce and investors are threatened to leave the competition.
The German customers will not be pleased with this in general.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like records.
Before you rush to the comment section to smear it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMaleMiddle-Age, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-heralded resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials wanting to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely to buy.
It is also not a crowd of hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results from YouGov correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly stuttering before I stop, hold my hands and say something definitive like, "So, let's take a closer look at this".
So, let's take a look at this.
Although the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants, and offices now fill the buildings once occupied by independent vendors - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, where I'm standing in close proximity to various men in such shops, trying to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray to Reckless Records, is in London for a day of meeting and is going through the shops to fill in the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he e-mailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), are lining the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they were released and to buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He admits that those who buy records tend to be introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hype, people who had heard about the comeback and were tempted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I've had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again", he says.
That would explain the boom in record revival fans of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
Wez said that some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youthful memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
That's how I am as a collector, and I think that's how a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" a worker exclaims from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50 percent of the people who bought a record last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I'm flipping through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
These are younger people, not older people, who are just coming in slowly.
Fopp, who's dedicated almost an entire floor to the record business, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts' latest synth- and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz thunders from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the nagging psychological trauma is hard to detect when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a shopkeeper than a big-time shopper.
She doesn't make much, so record collecting isn't really an option, she says.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is"... she drives off with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I pretend to sample the jeans, I watch a group of teenage girls gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left, you have a stairwell, a wall of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's all about the recording.
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the deep Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research found that YouGov's findings are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they ignore the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They're certainly not spending their Thursday morning wandering through Berwick Street record shops and flipping through records while avoiding the staring eyes of a creepy, 30-year-old fake presenter who is looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the record was set by a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week in Calais, authorities argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these sites should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy, which would not pay taxes and would pose a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further explained that the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the landslide was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and counseling on asylum issues for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the school "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom is eight years old".
Aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number to date - after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite disappointment at the Olympics, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin is not going to let himself be undermined.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting", the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at the Sugar Hat.
"I find it hard to comment on yesterday's timing", said Martin.
He should be able to analyze in peace what might have led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial in Qatar in October, Martin was actually going to compete for the title.
"I'm going to take a good look at everything we've changed lately".
"That includes my position", wrote the three-time world time trial champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday in the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Professional tennis player loses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's winning streak ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world ranked 32nd from Metzingen missed out by a 1:6 to 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
The European Union is also a major player in the development of the European Union.
Siegemund, plagued by back problems, was only able to complete her run once and appeared powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medalist Angelique Kerber (Kiehl/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner was British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
The last time two German DTB starters had appeared in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games was in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
The company is increasing its start-up for live video game broadcasting
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to take advantage of it.
The tech giant is buying the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not disclose the amount of money it will pay for the acquisition on Thursday.
Beam launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene.
For example, they can give players missions and face enemies, as well as provide equipment items.
The gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is supposed to help us on our way to the global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, U.S., are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
The acquisition is therefore not intended to change anything for the customers.
Microsoft says that Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube gaming is part of the Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Here comes the Enforcement trailer
German racers must adapt to the next generation of speedmeters: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested to transfer speed sensors particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Vitronic of Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in areas where accidents are serious, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on motorway construction sites or bridges undergoing renovation with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flashlight.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or too expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be detected simultaneously across several lanes.
Variable speed limits and prohibitions of traffic by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-drive condition, the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with any car with a trailer coupling.
To prevent it from being stolen, it is lowered during the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, an inbuilt alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various German states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
Great Britain takes silver in Rugby 7 after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the Rugby 7s came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rebound, line-running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-so-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on the day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' clear defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this format.
It might be a comfort to Britain - but it probably won't be - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head coach of England at Wimbledon.
GB has had a difficult journey.
Eight years ago, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off beautifully, and let the GBs' attacks bounce off for fun.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were riding in a moving bus, and the World Series winners were up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau overtook them in the corner.
With four minutes to play, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resumption and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tackling by the GB team and stormed to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the seven while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made some fundamental changes at half-time, closing the Fiji gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the first half conditions, until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant Fiji intermission.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game had long been in the favour of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-top with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced, and GB kicked the ground.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals and Britain had pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown led the boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the stumps in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-a-side team, secured the victory - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the coach's battle with cancer to win the rowing
There's no more emotional gold than at these games, and that means something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hives that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat, echoed by coach Robin Williams, as they rowed to their second Olympic gold in the two-woman class without a female driver, the first women in British sporting history to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, their 39th unbeaten attempt, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which doesn't fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in the oars is a battalion of willing helpers who are contributing to the incremental progress that makes a difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would survive that day.
Like he said, he's risking something.
I had bladder cancer that's operable, and they did.
If you don't, it's going to spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to begin treatment early in 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that's the right term at all under the circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was a motivation.
I was in the hospital, walking around the station -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but that makes it even more challenging.
In the immediate aftermath of the victory, her first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nerve-racking morning talking more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week.
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
We're nothing without Robin, so we're giving him a massive thank you.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen was like, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want to have fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better", she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The director of the water association Veitensteingruppe, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small French drinking water association as a model for the big water producers.
That is what was said in the original tone of a report on the Bavarian Radio some time ago.
The water forum of the government of Lower Franconia soon recognized the association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Social Fund.
Now he's retired at 65.
The drinking water association Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, produces about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 towns and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities.
The current chairman, Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller had been hired as water guard in 1985 and had already been appointed managing director of the association in 1988.
"His duties have been very varied and have ranged from water supply and maintenance work to office and organisational work, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends", said the chairperson.
The Commission's main achievements were the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the new well area (1998) and compensation to farmers, the refurbishment of the high-level tanks (1999), the purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renovation of water lines.
There was no standstill and innovation kept coming, because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He worked hard for his water company and he lived his water company as if it were his own business.
A few weeks ago, he was given the opportunity to present the success of the Veitensteing group's concept for nitrate sinking at the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia region.
For this he has received much recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best watcher and he was a loyal watchman.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
He cited the well-building and the restructuring of the special purpose vehicle as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the pipe break on the high-level tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, we had to work all night long to supply the villages with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was once maintained only by filling the reservoir with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and she says to other parents who are affected: "You have to have the courage to talk about it".
"Medicine has made great strides", the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she must die.
But Tiago, now eight, has made good progress and is now in private school in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him about something that happened two years ago when I was singing at the Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything", Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago is from Netrebko's connection to bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bargteheide - Man shoots his partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at about 10.45am on Friday in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn district).
"The man himself called us and said he had shot his partner", said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run, publicly wanted.
We're running nationwide now, because Sven S. could be driving.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, tan, and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
The man is now bald.
I don't want you to talk to the man directly.
He could still carry the gun, according to the police.
If you see Sven S, call 911.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not initially want to give details of the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"This is a homicide".
"We are not saying anything more at the moment", said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
- Steel lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-hit and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions in additional costs.
The financial burden that threatened the industry from the production of green electricity is off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for existing plants for so-called self-generating electricity in the German steel industry remains, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that after two years of hard negotiations we have finally reached this".
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption to pay.
The German steel industry was facing additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year, according to the German Industry Association.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will a 20% EEG surcharge be applied.
But even this is not collected in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on the production of electricity from renewable sources.
This largely confirms the status quo of the previous arrangements.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"This is the first step in our 'Steel is the future' campaign".
"Other must follow".
"Climate and employment targets must also be balanced in the reform of emissions trading", explained Jörg Hofmann, head of IG Metall, in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
The situation worsened last year when China, the world's largest steel producer, launched a massive steel supply to the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of dumping prices.
During this spring, the situation has somewhat eased.
On the one hand, the imposition of import duties on steel imports is having an impact and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
The prices have stagnated lately.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not rule out the closure of individual plants.
The German steel industry employed around 86000 people at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steelmakers remain cautious.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes of steel, well under six percent less than in the previous month, as the Steel Economic Association reported on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, production fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two per cent below the previous year.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, and Health: Singing Does Good for the Elderly
Ursel Kipp has been singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching program she took the music course, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically", she says.
After a rehearsal, she says, she feels balanced, cheerful, and more alive overall.
By the way, it does something good for their health and their mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with their peers, Hackler explains.
Regular social gatherings enable older persons to establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve with age, and a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience was also shared by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be able to arrange and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive way, Hackler says.
Because in doing so, seniors are practicing deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly strain your lungs, you may not get tired of your daily routine.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Seniors' Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people brings back many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Even people with dementia can recall events from long ago through song lyrics and especially melodies.
Singing also requires a special effort on the part of the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one's own voice and a given rhythm while adapting to other singers is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that comes from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Singing in the choir also increases self-esteem.
Showing yourself: If I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Lenz advises that those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they feel that they have little talent.
You can't sing alone. There's 50 people singing. Who's gonna hear a note that's off?
In search of the right offer, senior citizens have several options, says Hackler.
If you see someone from your circle singing in a senior choir, you can join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of local choirs.
If you wish to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church authorities directly.
Many senior choirs are also available online.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends, or neighbors to help you with your Internet research.
Hackler advises that those who feel like singing should join a choir.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats are more sensitive to young animals' cries than caterpillars
Biologists in Hanover have been studying the effect of the cries of kittens on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold either - but they always behaved the same, unlike the females.
Female cats can detect the degree of excitement of kittens by the way the young ones meow.
They respond 10 percent faster to sounds from kittens who suspect they are in great distress, as scientists at the Veterinary College and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats respond to the cries of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mumbling of young animals that are less and those that are more aroused are either not noticeable or not significant to the males", said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight female cats from the MHH's holding were observed.
They were played by little ones who were taken out of the pit for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
The second was the screams of more excited kittens, which were raised higher.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample size.
"All the females, even those that had not yet produced their own young, reacted differently to the cries", said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call of the much more excited kittens played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males responded at all", said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Some studies have shown that women are more sensitive to infants, whether they are mothers or not, reports biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for the Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued for the arrest of former football star Hakan Sükür.
He's accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football match is being played in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is in order.
The government has already declared that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected by the imposition of the state of emergency after the July coup attempt.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
And you don't stop before the football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant for former kick-kicker Hakan Sükür.
According to the report, Sükür, who now lives in the United States, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the initial 90-day state of emergency is still in force until October, it has hardly any impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country were declared over by Erdogan on Wednesday.
Sports, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club are not traditionally among the President's friends.
But what unites the majority of Turks, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is their strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the Gala Cup will be Lukas Podolski.
The 31-year-old proved his sporting value in the previous season: with 17 goals and nine appearances in all competitions, he finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the winning goal 1-0.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the field".
He finished the season in a great way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion ended in a reconciliation.
After the knockout stage in the Champions League, the Lions are also out of the Europa League early.
In the Super League, it was only enough to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Cup was the only way to win anything.
"We did it and that's the most important thing", Podolski said.
The year was better for Master Besiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons as Super League's top scorer, laid the foundation for the 14th title.
That's why fans are still hoping for the 31-year-old's return.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and had only been loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say so", club chief Fikret Orman told the Kicker magazine.
But if the striker is willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping, these athletes still have a chance at medals at the Rio Olympics
Justin Gatlin, 34, has already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other overzealous athletic sinners can only laugh at this - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had sued for her starting rights shortly before the Games after being banned for doping, was whipped and beaten mercilessly during her 100 meter breaststroke.
A curious scene ensued: with a smiling face, she was still strutting into the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it became clear that she would not get gold, the crowd erupted in cheers.
But there are many other athletes who, despite a history of doping, are going to compete in the Rio Olympics.
Here 's a rundown .
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-meter relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-meter relay, Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was banned for six months in 2010 after testing positive for the pain-relieving drug oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskos/Croatia): Olympic champion in 2012, world champion in 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016, tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine in 2011.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drugs and was suspended for six months.
The four longest throws this year go to the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-meter relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time 400-meter world champion tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement drug was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 meters.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been stripped of so many medals.
Nine years later, Tichon lost his 2005 world title after testing positive for testosterone.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up an Olympic silver medal in 2004 for steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also denied, following a ruling by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
With 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold-medallist tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to be taking a banned food supplement, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ban was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb attack in Thailand - Austrian woman wounded - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but had already been able to leave.
She planned her trip home for early September.
It is not clear whether Austrian citizens are also affected by further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities on this matter, Schnöll said.
Two bombs first exploded in a quiet neighbourhood in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, on Thursday evening.
Police said one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians.
Two more explosions were detonated Friday morning, killing one more person, according to authorities.
Phuket was also the scene of a bomb blast this morning.
Police say a taxi driver was injured in the blast near the popular beach Patong.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.
The blasting device was detonated in a flower bed outside the coast guard station, authorities said.
Finally, several people were injured in explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast.
They're assuming a connection to the Hua Hin explosions, they said.
"The bombings are all in the same handwriting", Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack".
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, which is typical of the bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces", said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities have received intelligence reports of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but have not been informed of the exact time and location.
It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have ordered their officers across the country to tighten security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are small bombings in Thailand, but they are not usually directed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website that the Thai security authorities' instructions be strictly followed.
High security risk (Security Level 3) is in the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslims, unnecessary travel to these provinces is advised.
The remainder of the country is at increased security risk (Security Level 2).
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will give the military a great deal of influence in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombings were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military junta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
However, the military has also failed to contain the years-long insurgency by Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the recent history of the country.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the Federal Constitutional Defenders have also put the group under surveillance.
"We see signs of efforts against the democratic order of freedom in the 'Identitarian Movement'", said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being vilified in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It is directed against "multicultural delusions", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of one's identity through over-alienation".
The "identitarian" movement is already being watched by constitutionalists in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.
Mr Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated its decision with the regional offices.
"Groups like the Identitarian Movement are trying to get their target group where they are", the head of the Constitutional Protection said.
In general, extremists try to appeal to them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
Islamists would do that, as would right-wing extremists.
This is not a publicity stunt for your cause.
Propaganda is supposed to make people feel good.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
It's dangerous, you know.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states of contacts between the "identitaries" and AfD politicians.
Measles said he had no knowledge of the matter.
The Commission has not yet decided whether the measures are compatible with the common market.
It is up to the party in question - in this case the AfD - to change its targeting and become extremist through certain individuals who are extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in law-motivated crime and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Mr Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we've seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society, or the Freital group.
It is quite possible that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups may be forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or attacks with other right-wing extremist motives.
The Commission is also concerned about the possible consequences of the terrorist attacks.
The previous groups had been set up at regional level or in social networks.
He expressed concern that many attacks were carried out by people who had not appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying part.
Many of the suspects in the attacks on asylum-seekers had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wingers.
"Many people have committed crimes that were previously unrelated to right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the left, but who then radicalised themselves by creating right-wing extremist sentiment".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiro's wealth becomes an Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight Ethiopian swimmer swam so slowly that he was no longer seen on TV.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, having became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his preliminary race with a 48-second gap, finishing 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was his rather unsporting figure that caught the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given a special start by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to raise awareness of swimming in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Robel Kiros's got to get ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly spread.
Some media called him "the whale's robin".
In the English tabloid The Sun, he was mocked as "Dad Bod" for his "prosperity belly".
His time, he only started with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
The equatorial Guinean swimmer's performance was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a 100-meter freestyle sprint.
Moussambani was frantically encouraged at the time.
The then 22-year-old had only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial loft in DTLA is given a cosy makeover
We're celebrating the 90th anniversary of the L.A. Central Library with -- what else?
The owner of a shop on New Place has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder left her shop at about 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at about 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the register.
No trace of the perpetrator has been found.
There's no video surveillance either.
Trump doesn't see the impending election defeat as a close call
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Florida.
If the election to the presidency of the United States fails, Donald Trump has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively unconcerned: "In the end, it will either work or I have a very, very nice, long vacation", the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance has been forming lately.
Post increases in electric transport trade
A German Post electric delivery vehicle in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently high.
The Post is planning to sell their electric StreetScooter as well.
The company intends to start trading in the transporter soon.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the open car market from next year.
"We want to get into selling to third parties", a Post spokesman said Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
The post office board member, Jürgen Gerdes, had said that there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, the Bonn-based group intends to start mass-producing the vehicles soon.
In its own post-manufacturing plant, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group was planning to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aimed at a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020", he had said at the end of July.
I imagine we're going to reorganize the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been operating on German roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann would become more uncertain the longer the successes he promised were not achieved.
Turbulence at the helm of Nuremberg-based market research firm GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the management, the industry's world number five is facing a new start in personnel.
The CEO of GfK wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of GfK, Arno Mahlert, will already resign from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management board will be taken over by former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of 1 September, the company said.
He is to officially assume the role of "chairman" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
The company cited as the reason for the withdrawal 'different views on the long-term business policy orientation'.
A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday.
It is not yet clear who will lead the market research company.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had been disappointed by the continued failure to achieve the restructuring measures initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet visible even after five years", it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will be uneasy at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same", it said.
The company also failed to stop its loss-making business in the second quarter of 2016 after the setbacks in the previous quarters.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1% below the level of the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
In comparison with the first half of the year, sales fell by 3,4% to EUR 721.2 million.
The second quarter's profit was mainly affected by the fall in the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The total loss of the group was EUR 148.2 million as a result of the EUR 139 million of corporate write-downs that were necessary in the Consumer Experience business.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19,7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides into curves in ditches: eight injured
A bus with 43 elderly passengers was involved in an accident in Krummhörn (Aurich district) on Thursday, injuring eight people.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of a bus operated by a tour operator in Eisenach said she had to avoid a lorry that had come to meet her, part of which was on the opposite track.
The bus turned right off the road and slid into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police said.
"Because of the bus' location, the people could not get off the bus themselves", she said.
The fire department released the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Highway 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum by a regular bus.
They were to wait for a replacement bus from the tour company.
Investigators called on the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water are set at EUR 3,44 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant area as from 1 October 2016, instead of EUR 2,10; EUR 3,36 for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously EUR 2,26) and EUR 3,64 for Azendorf (previously EUR 2,18).
The wastewater charge for the Azendorf plant will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvements are needed.
The price of waste water in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic metre, according to an excess calculation.
As reported by Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach County Council showed that these wastewater facilities were underfunded.
The market is obliged by law to operate the plants on a cost-based basis.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses in Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to put their money where their mouth is.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Herbert Schmidt, the managing director, pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater installations of the market community was necessary.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
Schmidt justified the significant increases in fees by stating that all three wastewater treatment plants were relatively small installations with a very low wastewater flow rate of between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, the low distribution base would result in serious costs of several thousand euros for necessary repairs.
In addition, the effluent flow in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, in the previous calculation period, all three plants incurred considerable costs of renovation and repair, not least because of their age.
The Azendorf plant is almost 30 years old, the Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth plants and the Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp plants are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system at the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant had to be replaced due to a breakdown.
The almost 20-year-old pumping plants at the Welschenkahl pumping plant had to be completely overhauled, and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to dismantle the first sewage pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of the sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation system in order to comply with water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses were added the continuing maintenance costs which are to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period".
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser pointed out that the low wastewater flow in the three plants "fully beat" the costs of operation and maintenance.
The Commission also considered that the Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of taxation on waste water was not sufficient to justify the imposition of a tax on the use of waste water.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, in the opinion of Steinhäuser, especially since the supply area of the wastewater utility association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended to these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria recorded first inflation in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest level since June 2012 and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation rate for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8% as measured by the CPI.
The Commission also analysed the impact of the measures on the Union industry's financial performance.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
In July 2016, the following categories of consumer goods increased in price compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); leisure and culture (6,3%); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); various goods and services (0,3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identities in ways that are already bordering on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, or a dog, or a figure that could be from a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are blatant, perversion-of-character tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any misconduct will be made public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism, with accusations that the app promotes blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter this week that gave some users squinting eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to pay homage to anime characters and not to caricature Asians.
But for outsiders who had experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was "offensive and, to say the least, uncomfortable".
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced has been drawn to the degrading extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company crossing this cultural barrier.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder to keep things like that from going unnoticed than it used to be", 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people of color in their workforce so they can make those kinds of decisions", said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of color working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it".
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely remained unanswered on Snapchat.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that her Snapchat account will be closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK".
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Budget Committee, reports widespread discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors had changed their assessments of the American effort to fight the Islamic State.
The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically obtained by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of American counterterrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence agencies", said one newspaper article quoting the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders", noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws at Centcom extend to the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While it does not provide direct evidence that Obama's administration was directed to change the reports, it does show how analysts have been under pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than factual", the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a military retake of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is clear", said Mike Pompeo, the Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top brass in Central Command altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after being tipped off that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense is underway.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that were consistent with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restrictive process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services", said Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, in a statement.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports", damaged the morale of analysts, and "gave excessive scope for dissent".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of any White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding "a particular political opinion".
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense".
The investigation has implications beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Department of Defense officials).
But last year's accusations have raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence recalls a twist from more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then-George W. Bush administration, despite the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker found, according to government sources, that contrary to government claims, airstrikes against Islamic State-run refineries did not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were set up to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is about to begin
One day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she can't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their gates in their memory.
But she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are tied in their group with the British women, who are unbeaten after their 2-0 win over Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the match will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will achieve first and second place respectively.
The first-place finisher will be a little longer away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have sparked a surprising upheaval with their success story, four years after finishing last out of 12 at the London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey bat at age three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University). At age 16, she became the youngest player in the history of the team to become a U.S. national champion.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the national team's coach, and things began to turn for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the workforce in London that we have now.
We've completely reversed the course.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close.
India had entered the tournament without a win, but the team proved surprisingly tenacious, holding the match 1-0 until the third quarter, when Bam took the game into his hands.
She sprinted the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and ran the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position", Parnham said, "but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday".
In the midst of the Olympic rage, the Zen of trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitable, a furious race between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning stick, passed from armchair shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in his first Olympics and a female fighter with a dimple, could have been one of those big names on prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline event.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow, are the sports not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast-swimming and may it last.
But if I may humbly make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so poorly perceived over the past 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012 had an athlete make it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the men's prices and the Chinese and the Canadians the women's prices.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the uneducated ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
I should admit at this point that I'm not an expert, but just a down-to-earth enthusiast.
It has humor potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of jogging and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "El Trampolin", which means "jump board".
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to almost 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of falling movements (spin, stitch, and jump) before landing on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight forward.
In their quest for gold, medal hopefuls must go on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playing field.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting line, but in the television broadcast they are also chasing another ridiculous target: the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I find a little tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline gives you a break.
The trampoline jump vector is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here again, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no long-distance bulging, only the dreamlike, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as competing in the Olympics can be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will be streamed at 1 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday afternoon, and the men's on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days beginning at 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general uproar.
If awareness can be raised only by targeting and objectifying male athletes - as the male US turners recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new, breathless fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent government opposition.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in shootouts during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights organizations say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, believed to date from late or early this year, show security officers beating young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights office is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future", said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the way in government repression - opposition in the country has been curbed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or imprisonment, killed, or driven into the vast wilderness.
But that could change.
"When you oppress people and they have no other option but to protest, it breaks out", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protest.
A generation of protestors.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to strangulation in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last opposition seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, where a battle over this fraught, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of underlying hiccups.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide their whereabouts.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered in this way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromo and Amhara are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amhara, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered politically and economically while exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that's changing, too.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella", said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromo people.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhara and Oromo people feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill", said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the place of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands protested against an election that analysts say was apparently rigged and then stolen by the government.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in previous months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in reducing poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disapproval of the Ethiopian government.
And it's taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-run businesses, and hatred of Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it was closing that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.
"This", said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk".
Donald Trump says his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by saying that his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group were not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow defenders, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backed off on Thursday's claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the day before, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was taking the accusation seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the blow by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is pouring down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economic situation over falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the state of the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic.
He tweeted that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense.
In late July, he drew heavy criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained, "Of course I meant that sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, 'clarify' depending on how the reaction is", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more acrid tone as his poll numbers have fallen further.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a lead with large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been the focus of increasing attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's pranks have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is legitimate, political commentary", Mr. Giuliani said, so when asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It's true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little, almost unknown organization, he called it a backbench, completely wrong, and that's why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Mrs. Clinton serving as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's Pennsylvania campaign rallies, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of being biased against him and of running around on every word he said.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once the price is overtaken by the market, the cafe in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shitty coffee shop in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals felt it was the last loss in a gentrified city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except for the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, then it's also reinvention.
A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and manager of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, has learned a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels, bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and garnishes such as cabbage and salted onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but they're serving fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg", he said.
One of those customers was Rebecca Oliveira on a recent Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd take the road.
After the verb was closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the start of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter to seven every day, like a Swiss watch and they cooked my Everything bagel with butter", he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel to bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't resent the soap shop taking over the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we'll take her offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to put it on display soon so his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There's a chance the cafe could expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that walking into the place and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell it", he said.
The Depressing Food of the Economic Crisis in "A Plentiful Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies like pate de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people", Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", tells of life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will be published Tuesday in Harper's, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-nonsense snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive slices, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered a roast beef, the couple found it fitting for a discussion of food during the Great Depression.
"Friendly foods were very popular", Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese, and bean bread.
They're made from one ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers, and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways in which the country dealt with the fact that it was no longer the land of the razor-sharp.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans", Coe began, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods like bread and casseroles became staples, which casseroles were "a wonderful way to recycle leftovers", Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the centerpiece of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar blends were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking sensibilities.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the lunch", says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal".
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were pushing the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pumpkin into delicious meals like creamy spaghetti and carrots.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly delightful are the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let Me Have Cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce", said Coe.
He was eating in a nearly gilded dining room and wearing a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't urged him to make an example of his stomach.
As the book describes, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in taste led to the White House producing the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most desolate cooked".
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of dealing with food were abandoned as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they had a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of food waste", said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick".
That's when the windbag incident happened.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip", Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes with a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got three more hits.
Like a can-do budget animal, he told his wife, "A couple of chopped walnuts would help".
He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save other people's lives.
Now the 30-year-old has himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil defence group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far, according to Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers risk their lives to help evacuate people from bombed-out homes and to provide first aid in war zones.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil servant rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house for 11 hours went viral in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But he never saw himself as a hero, and according to the picture, he said, "For me, that's the real jihad".
"If I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr".
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had talked in a video about the recent bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory failure.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it", the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight to see.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an inspection on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and is swimming across the North Atlantic at a good 1 km/h - to this day.
Greenland sharks don't have young until they're 150.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching an average of just 4,200 feet [1,220 m] in one hour.
Only when it counts does the five-meter-long animal accelerate to a whopping two miles per hour - half the speed of a seal at its top speed.
But this slow-paced lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science that a Greenland shark may be 392 years old.
"It's crazy", says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, about this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
True, evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are going to become petrified.
Just the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, for they live mainly in the icy sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter outside Spitsbergen.
Researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of one of these sharks, and another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the sea ice, looking for corpses that are drifting down from higher water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught off Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just two feet [81 cm] long, while the largest was three feet [502 cm].
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens sinks of the sharks.
This centre of the eye lens is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in their lens core.
Their birth would therefore be after the early 1960's, when nuclear weapons tests released large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The third-smallest animal, measuring 220 centimeters (220 inches) in length, had a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons testing, so it would have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 when it was examined.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark to be 335 years old, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark may even be 392 years old.
It was known that female Greenland sharks would not produce young until they were over four meters long.
Now researchers could assign length to age.
Since one of the animals, measuring some three feet [392 cm], was on the verge of maturing and was aged 156 years, it seems that the Greenland sharks take at least a century and a half to reproduce.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusulas live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record-holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck to its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
The low temperatures often make the organism of the animals living there run amok.
So they mature later and age more slowly.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals often grow particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible", explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building soil in double pack
The Council of the Municipality has been particularly concerned with building issues at its most recent meeting.
The committee was relieved to hear Mayor Robert Putz announce that "the newly designated housing units can finally be put on the market".
After the land, parceling and development issues have been resolved and the applications for surveys have been submitted, there is no longer any obstacle to the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and wealthy seniors alike.
As was said, building volunteers can now report to the town hall, and the allocation of the plots will probably be discussed by the town council at its September meeting.
In order to meet requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which had been drawn up in the spring of this year, in certain areas.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there will be extended by two plots towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms moving from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote", says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IMF's financial and real estate markets competence area.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether banks will be allowed to continue to operate from London throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport is currently only available in the UK.
Big American banks are using it right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will be moving jobs.
The lobbying group Frankfurt Main Finance expects to create 10,000 new jobs on the Main in five years.
Frankfurt is the home of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB.
The OECD is headquartered in Paris, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authorities", says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but, like Dublin, it is performing worse in terms of infrastructure.
The Commission also notes that the airport is a major airport and that it is much easier to reach Frankfurt.
The city also scores with easily available commercial properties.
"It is not so easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris", says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than its competitors, thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, and less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors", concludes the IW.
But economists say that despite the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's most important financial centre.
The balance of power also speaks for itself: in London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, at the end of 2015, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred in its hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a $200 million damages award for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical actions.
U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, who filed the lawsuit Thursday, said that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which is dominating the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently combing the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, which is allied with the DPRK, told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are conducting cleanup work", he told Reuters.
The Clintons are making $10.75 million in 2015 and paying 34.2% of their federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; the former Secretary of State reported an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her time at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, are releasing their tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency", Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited a tax audit as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted in reference to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about his wealth, his charitable giving, his business practices and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already taken up the issue, posting a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans urge Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades, and release his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business reporter on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers as saying that this may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama supports the proposal as well.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, urged Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he's also been subjected to an IRS audit and that Trump is "afraid" of voters, not the IRS.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most other Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed $109,000 in dividends and income.

Condoms with chilies, fireworks to promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox method to keep elephants from entering human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilipudder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has partnered with the U.S. Conservation Service to step up their funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many have used spears to defend themselves before.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, with them becoming much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming the elephant", Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called chili cloud is thrown.
Chilip powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework into a condom, the end of which is twisted to the spark plug.
When it is ignited, the condom explodes with a bang and sprays fine dust of chilipudder into the air.
A breath quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A final option is a thrower who shoots a gold pyrotechnic into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: no kiosk building on the Rhine bank of St. Goar
St. Goar's business community is usually open to investment projects from traders - the retail sector in the core city is considered to be particularly viable.
The proposal to build a new ski shop on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony under construction was now unanimously rejected by the City Council.
"We generally welcome new businessmen, but at this exposed location on the Rhine, this kiosk is not suitable", said Michael Hubrath of the CDU group.
Jewish director demolishes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots sparked a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli favorites because Arab guests "requested it", according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, let out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country directory.
However, the country was not listed among those countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the default be deleted", the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a "great disgrace", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more shameful.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a stir on the Internet, with people calling it a scandal.
Some suggested that the Kempinski Hotel had "ceded" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you", said another article, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all the accusations, calling the incident a "negligence" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list", the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country prefix has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest the government's reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protests came days after protesters took to the streets in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was voted out of office by the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 percent - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have been increasing their interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing links with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran", said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade surge was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,' the Ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy abroad issued some 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, is being broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
Witnesses wanted: beverage market robbed in forest broth
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a gun in their hand, three dark-clothed persons with their faces disguised demanded cash from the liquor store clerk and then fled, first on foot and then presumably in a silver VW Golf.
The police are not telling us how much money was taken.
The perpetrators were said to be between 5'6" and 5'7" tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the Rewe Market parking deck and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the robbery towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking area opposite the entrance to the car park with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made any observation at the time of the robbery (about 7:45 p.m.) should report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun in the summertime
The children and young people of the social-pedagogical day group/social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Association spent eight happy days with their carers during their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure area of Hardtwäldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the agenda.
For one thing, we went to the petting zoo to see the boards.
The other was to Maulbronn, where a special children's tour was held at the world-famous monastery.
The third expedition led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake at Maulbronn, which offered a place for jumping, swimming, and planing.
The children and carers were treated to their own homemade food, such as Sauren Spätzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
Workshops were held to create beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or to make a Roman-style wooden mill.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun was shining and the children and youths returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna Unit of the Ministry of the Holy Spirit were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were completed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministers to Rome, which is expected to take place in two years' time, the Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage of several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the bishopric of Freiburg was finally chosen, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening of the Gate of Mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 mines from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Sanctum were on their way.
The night before, Father Storost had sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration at St. Anna's, blessed the pilgrim crosses and bestowed the pilgrim's blessing.
From Horb, the train took us to Villingen, where there is also a Our Lady's Monastery, and so the pilgrimage route was started from the monastery.
Each morning and evening, the daily tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs, and scriptures.
But on the way, the mini-classes would stop at field crosses, chapels, or churches to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
The nightly accommodation was provided by local parishes.
At the stage finishes, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and nourishing dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, the journey continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter was the most difficult, since it was necessary to descend to an altitude of about 500 meters in the heat of the day and climb again.
The reward was a night of barbecues at the bathing pool.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we headed for the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster the following afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy.
A little impulse here thanked God.
At the evening mass in Münster, the mini-pilgrims who arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day, it was time for the Breastfeeding Metropolis.
In the afternoon, we took the train back to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home as Brit earns gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio, as the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken over, and the youngster made the legend proud as he stormed home to claim a victory from the favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after finishing only a modest sixth place at the London World Railway Championships in March despite Hoys's withdrawal.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time for Hindes to show up.
Hoye's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the shaft that was now unfolding.
Hindes, Kenny -- who won with Hoy four years ago -- and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny took the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen onto the track after a poor start.
He later retracted this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a stunning victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the British flags on the grandstand".
We've been working together as a team for the last three months.
We've been so bad at so many world titles, it's unbelievable to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we're looking at a successful five days at the Velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's within the realm of possibility that he'll repeat Hoys' three-time Olympic gold medal in one event.
That would mean a six-gold and a silver medal tally for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on that day).
That's what Hoy said.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and will last three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment".
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four mile race.
They finished in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of competition, with Wiggins sure to be the focus.
He had been arguing with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him in to measure his height.
In the women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time of 4:13,260.
Team GB relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-Olympic period and take home a slew of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
There were dramas in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of celebrities such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look at the first night of the competition at the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's smelter in doubt due to the termination of the energy contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake as the plant operator will terminate the power supply contract, ending all supply contracts, the energy company said.
This follows the decision by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be a domino effect, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Portland Alcoa smelter is losing money and risking closure.
This follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
'AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter,' the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called 'insurance transactions' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, which means that they will end in 2017.
'As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in FY17,' the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from FY18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to sell the contracts did not affect Alcoa's "ability to operate the smelter or to provide the smelter with electricity".
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that was due to take effect in November of this year, even though it still owes an explanation as to why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to the statements of analysts earlier this week, Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as power producers, that would not be good", he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has been at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover's unveiling was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?) scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the troubled Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the all-time favorite showbiz uncle and Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover and ending with a classic twist: they've all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the line, "You thought we forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a 8:00 a.m. airing site), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to participate in that publicity.
With the September issue of Vogue, a new era for the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have beaten her on the cover of Vogue (she and her husband Kanye West were featured on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a volume that resembles a cartoon rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 of the 832 pages of the roll were advertising).
The cover star's reveal is so eagerly awaited that over the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there's clearly more "celebrity models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slim chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or today's teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although all of this is true of Jenner).
They're really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been a little tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner criticized her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the scumbags of the moment".
Those feelings boiled over again when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
But riding around on the grief seems to be getting to the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her own photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community justice centers reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy are turned away from the municipal justice centres each year as the industry prepares for the impact of further cuts in funds on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, helpless workers, victims of violence and those without the means for unjust evictions and the like - are already denied free legal advice and assistance.
The municipal legal services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June of next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Law Center, said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that without a reversal of the Federal Government's decision, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from essential services you need", he said.
People who leave abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly fired - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of Queenslanders who are most in need will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal courts and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after staff allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after being told that his North Carolina campaign manager pointed a gun at an employee while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software developer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing "that wasn't going to happen".
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulls a pistol, puts his right index finger on the trigger, and rams the run into Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage", Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed a judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, was unavailable for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were unanswered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Superior Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before national elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are expected to see significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This is the result of a representative poll conducted by the INSA opinion research institute for the Bild newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black coalition government could hardly continue to rule in the north, according to polling figures in Berlin this is not possible.
In both Länder, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance of remaining head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party is therefore only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could reach 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be represented at 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.
The Greens are moving back into the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) despite slight losses.
The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD would only be 23 percent (Election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the Pirates would miss the draw, unlike 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in time: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator was launched.
The successors dominate the world today - its maker experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good to hold.
On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into the market exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few dollars, the devices are still available online, but they're somehow from the stone age of the Internet.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a "West-pocket office".
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for the standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even web pages could be accessed via HTML browsers, though at a painfully slow pace.
A calculator, a digital address book and an electronic calendar were available.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was quite high: 2700 D-marks, or about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have foreseen in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's changed since then.
Smart phones are a success story, but not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone business suffered an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and liquidated.
The market is now dominated by vendors who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online at all times and everywhere is a daily thing for many people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
Add to this the successful business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now been built around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, all easily operated with a touch screen.
Apple's triumphal march began, and today the iPhone is still the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the aftermath.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a given 20 years after its invention.
Today, on average, every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away", said Janina Kugel, Siemens' board member responsible for personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and to London, but to the whole country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction at Heathrow, just like in London in 2012, when we went to great lengths to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities alone and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
As they were in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England would never be ready for the Games and that we would embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question you ask.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just one.
Expansion is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running - to T2 built in the middle of the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.
It is time we steered that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse" game about ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are "cat-and-mouse" according to one software company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the encoding for its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers", and that it's possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, almost four times as many as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of the revenue that Facebook considers the investment of such a step to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over ads targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so we've focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman killed by a car on Swiss highway
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over by multiple vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have been questioned, but some have not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to come forward.
An investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
That is something the prosecutor has to decide", said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking on the highway in the dark - it was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of manslaughter after she ran over and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with any further information about the incident near Thursday morning should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet it was slowly spinning.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus' slow rotation exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats up the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures several degrees cooler than the Earth is today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembled the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing a lack of voice in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", said Roy, 50, in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at present.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today", Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's Jack Adams Award winner as the best coach during his debut season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the Wild by five points for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike
The labour battles over the pay of North Sea oil workers are being suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield services provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of settling the current dispute", a joint statement said.
We will be holding a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to re-examine the issues.
The unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9% this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's reduction in fees follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary room to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to cease its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business operations as a result of its mega-gas merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few", he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades
The latest Kepler mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars are spewing out large amounts of stellar winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars", said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older", said Rebull.
There is much more to learn, such as how, when, and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dancing shoes", as it were.
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three newspaper reports, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Tears ran faster for Alex Rodriguez than the American baseball star in his prime from base to base.
After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team".
"I say goodbye to both of them", explained the 14-time All-Star of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the league's Most Valuable Player three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signing a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of his contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to work as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homers, 3,114 hits and 2021 runs batted in for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and Yankees since 2005, he has achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar numbers in major statistics.
But the 41-year-old is not likely to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance off the field.
In 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the prime suspect in years of receiving performance-enhancing drugs from an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league might have even done me a favor for 2014, because I've played 20 years without a break", Rodriguez said at the time.
His good-bye days don't go by without a sound.
While many baseball legends were given the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour".
"My job is to try to win every game", Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is rumored to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the fans sang in the 4-9 loss to the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete caught almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have been reported at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive and were eliminated in Brazil - just before the start of the critically-watched athletics competition.
Mr Chen was found to be in possession of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, used as a masking agent for doping substances, on Sunday.
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed her disqualification from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final, missing the bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to compete in the preliminary 50m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and a hearing.
The national federation "takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigation", Xinhua quoted a statement as saying, "We will cooperate with the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS, that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, news spread about the positive test in Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive", she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements", explained the athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, and according to BNT, the B sample has already tested positive.
The Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, immediately criticized the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes are not making the right decisions", he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to compete in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also announced, the London Olympic champion in the 85 kg class, who like his brother Tomasz had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier.
Both contest the take, but both are not allowed to start in the under 94 kg class.
Before the start of the athletics, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the sport as a whole.
The IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from the race, with one exception, because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan nation also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the past in China had also caused intense fights among the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang is peeing purple".
"When I see the podium over 200m freestyle, I want to throw up", Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers", he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but was only banned for three months.
How treacherous hackers are extorting ransom
Extortion malware developers are now targeting companies - and are succeeding.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom, and Germany by malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an extortion-software attack at least once, or several times, in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have been the target of ransomware extortion.
Forty percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to regain access to the compromised systems and data.
Malwarebytes' observations show that the perpetrators specialize their extortion software in increasing attacks on corporate networks.
If they succeed, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently seeing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware", explains Marcin Kleczynski, head of Malwarebytes, in an interview with "Welt".
In 2008, most malware was still designed to send ads.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Initially, the target was private users, but the shift to corporate attacks has been alarmingly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works in a simple way: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently erase the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailer.
To obtain the final encryption code for the files, victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But whereas private users have their personal photo database at stake, companies have sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stalled.
This means that the damage is higher when ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported losses in revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely shut down their business, and in one case people's lives were in danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been the victims of attacks on several occasions, where patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell victims not to pay, you're only adding to the problem", Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the perpetrators' demands in the face of a shutdown in the company.
Hackers know this and will do anything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers looked at the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and found that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money.
They chat their victims about how to pay with Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And when individuals are redeemed after paying a few hundred euros, some companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware in about a week".
However, it is more likely that there are three or four persons involved.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual extortionists.
The malware kits that have been around since then were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting, and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The package includes a customization tool to change smaller configurations, appearance and branding", says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then hire additional hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from one criminal, and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then hire spammers to distribute the information", explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now well known by many companies that are doing better to secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust ransomware to be defended by file backup and scanning software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful surveillance, the perpetrators instead threaten to release sensitive data, such as customer lists or price estimates", explains Marcin Kleczynski, Malwarebytes' CEO.
This means that the potential for damage is many times greater than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target entirely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for many victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating it in the future, then ransomware could become an issue in Industry 4.0 as well.
One for each case
The Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the little HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe, and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday use.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, it has plenty of space for passengers in both the front and rear, and it is not cramped anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well-worked and look pleasant, except for the cockpit top that falls off a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
Not only is there a 453 litre trunk space for upright and 1026 litre for folded backrests, but there are also the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The backseat seats fold up like movie seats, providing storage space that is four feet [1.24 m] high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk is well loaded, but the loading height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel engine with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully over wide speed ranges thanks to its torque of up to 300 Nm.
He should be doing his job a little more quietly, though.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment of the top-of-the-line Executive variant tested is unsatisfactory.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the Track-Keeping Assist.
The collision warning system is sometimes irritated because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when it is scanning.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent time controller responds to traffic signals and reduces speed if necessary.
But full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-line features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration, and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit difficult to reach.
The 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you can get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger deck.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability was conceivable only in the case of hazards typical of air transport (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken his kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life-threatening event, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When the organiser pays
Sick holidaymakers will only get their money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can be found in the hotel without a doubt.
But that is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family suffered severe diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The tourists attributed their illness to a faulty sewage system that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was flawed - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage system was indeed defective.
However, the organizer did not learn of the event until shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine by then.
So he did not violate his duty to inform, according to the judgment.
The water samples showed no contamination.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion - is a general life-threatening condition.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The State must react to terrorist threats with both prudence and determination.
One thing is certain: our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow the terrorists to win this victory.
But if criminals are forced to leave the country faster, it increases security and also strengthens public support for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to see the proposals implemented by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced further staffing of the security forces, "on a medium-sized four-digit scale over several years".
We need to reinstate the penalty for supporting terrorism.
Video surveillance is to be improved, gun laws are to be updated, especially to make it more difficult to buy guns on the Internet.
The most recently discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained, de Maizière said.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism and called for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism.
The Minister considers that better social care is necessary to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To pursue criminals in specific areas of the Internet (the dark web), de Maizière is planning to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to discuss anything that will help to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the hardliners in the CDU/CSU", Gabriel told the Funke Media Group newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the EU for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He also called for a general ban on full veiling, which he considered problematic under the constitution.
You can't ban everything you don't want, and I don't want you to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, such as those governing traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate effectiveness and ability to act with new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet slogans and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people in this country".
Improving traffic flow on the motorway
It's regularly crammed into the bypass - this is a November picture.
But that is to change: the right-of-way is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are in traffic jams every evening on the surrounding road when they pass the motorway junction (A 43).
The Landwerk Straßenbau will extend the right-hand cornering track by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then drive right from Hammer Street.
The major advantage is that traffic is split up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea of extending the exit was the CDU group in the Münster-West district council.
The narrowing of the road on the junction is particularly annoying to motorists between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Way and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B-51 just before the Weseler road exit.
From here, traffic is only directed one lane over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt over three and a half years ago.
The reason was that static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load capacity to handle heavy goods traffic, especially on two lanes.
The length of this congestion and the associated workday congestion cannot be stated by the relevant regional operator.
However, it will take years, as the bridge has an official remaining useful life until 2034.
The State has deliberately chosen the less busy school holidays to extend the legal loop, because disabilities were to be expected.
Traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural travel: cultural offerings for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
Nima's and the Young Theatre are planning a musical project.
Nima's enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcoming classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the youngsters in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the plot, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people aged 14 to 20 with and without refugee or migrant backgrounds will be given the opportunity to attend professionally-led courses in singing, dance, drama and music.
The programme is designed to provide children and families with theatre plays and theatre language courses.
The project "Intercultural Travel" is continuing.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of starbursts: Hope for better weather
The weather in southwestern Germany on Friday night has put a damper on stargazers - but there is still hope.
The night was not suitable for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
If the weather is good, we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The shells are Perseids, which are among the fastest, reaching speeds of 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They are so named because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Sleeping at night: Tips for sleeping problems
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't even think about sleep before the alarm clock.
That's far from relaxing.
After all, such problems are in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders, and more than 10 percent find their sleep frequent or permanent.
What are the symptoms of sleep problems or sleep disturbances?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what is commonly understood by this term is insomnia, a sleeping disorder.
Many people find that sleeping through is not satisfying or sufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Association of Family Physicians with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is the cause of sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
It can be caused by organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but it can also be caused by medication.
Often, sleep disorders are the result of another illness.
"Waking up too early is especially common in depression", says Weeß.
And it could be that different factors are causing each other.
For example, a person who has a herniated disc may be unwell, wake up every two to three hours, and begin to ponder over everyday problems and worries, Weiss explains.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you start seeing a doctor for sleep disorders?
Weiss advises that those who do not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a month and who have problems during the day should see a doctor.
The disorder can be of many kinds: feeling tired, tired, not sleeping, having trouble paying attention and concentrating, being easily irritable, having mood swings, or having physical problems such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to identify the causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, and medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are few registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre at the Charité University Medical Center in Berlin.
That is why, according to Weiss, you should first consult your family doctor if you have trouble sleeping.
He can run tests to see if the problems are physical.
Who's going to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, doctors recommend sleep testing for snoring with breathing aids, sickly daytime tiredness, sleepwalking, or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be found, explains Fietze.
You don't have to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just don't take a nap", says Fietze. "I'm not going to sleep in the middle of the night".
After the wiring, you go to bed at your usual time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear goggles, a breast belt, and a feel on your finger.
And a camera on the ceiling is recording the sleeping people.
How can those affected cope?
There are quite a few screws you can turn to for better sleep.
The way counts: regular bedtime and wake-up time, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - because then you start calculating right away, and that is not helpful at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympus via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won his first gold at the Doha World Short Track Championships, setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has taken a protective stand against his former teammates who are criticized via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a prize of €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised at missing medals", the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of progress in the fight against drug abuse.
We cannot compete with countries which promote a lot of drugs and which do not look at the issue of doping very closely or even practice it.
"I am not saying that controls should be abolished here", he continued.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to have registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) nine months before his first start.
That is exactly what we should do with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be checked by independent WADA/FINA inspectors a certain time before the World Cup/Olympic cannot participate", demands the Hamburg-based choice, who now runs an ice-dome.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf airport
Civil investigators from the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and baggage thefts as a gang.
At about 9:30 p.m., civil servants at Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, and had acted in a collaborative, collaborative and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four acts of the thieves who entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In all, they had stolen more than 15,000 euros.
The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "Dangerous Places" of the city.
If you walk down the street from east to west, you'll pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten, and a biochemistry store.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a gray house.
A house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.
However, in recent weeks, articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate firm Friedrichshain calls it, have been shown with cars on fire.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
The Berlin Innensenator Henkel in particular had since the beginning of the year repeatedly spoken out in favour of a harsh police approach to the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the cadder smithy, were cleared on June 22 with 300 police officers, the police, according to official statements, patrolled the site for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three squad cars, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled out under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with their children, people are sitting on the sidewalk in front of their houses in the sun, others are chatting late.
In the immediate vicinity of the housing projects are a primary school and a kindergarten.
Violence is not a major concern for many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share with the residents of the housing projects the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kisser who wanted police protection from left-wing vandals.
The trench that the Berlin Innensenator and the police are opening between the occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which still has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
The housing occupations and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of Riga.
While Mainz was cleared in a full-scale street battle under heavy police force, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly attractive to tourists and Berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR and former occupants of the house now share their kizes with them.
This is also evident in rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent in new rental units since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by discarded windows or freshly painted facades, which have been sprinkled with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year alongside the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: statistics show that crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
The majority of crime is damage to property, which tends to be more common in new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of insecurity.
As far as violence is concerned, it is reassuring: the people in '94 are their neighbours, who certainly were not.
The famous burning cars are no longer in Riga.
For the architect, her street is not a crime hotspot, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get to know each other more than anywhere else".
The new builder moved to Riga Street deliberately - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politicians and the media, who all of a sudden claimed interpretive sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents and new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building spaces that displace the old residents.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not of interest to many here - people who are not so well-topped are more likely to live here", she says.
"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction".
But what do you do when no one listens?
Frustration is building on all sides, including the police and residents.
For those who are angry about colored bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Parents should be aware of this - just as a person who moves to a bar can complain about noise.
All persons presented only by first name have asked not to be called by their real name
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.
She's also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the management team led by Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as the contact point for all stakeholders: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, the administration, the authorities and others involved.
Regine, a client from the work group, suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-laying woolly milk-sawmill, which has a problem above all.
This was the intention of some - not in a mocking way but rather in view of the variety of areas of work which were being sought - when the administration wanted to publish the vacancy.
The search was for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, a woolly milk sow laying eggs.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is mainly about organisation, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
She's got a 50% job for three years.
"It was high time", says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported honorary and mainstream actors.
There are problems, big and small, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
The problem of finding accommodation for the recognised refugees has been a serious one for some time.
The local authorities are responsible for the accommodation provided.
You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these accommodation facilities must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility is shifting from the county council to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
The administration is not able to find private apartments.
The Commission has not yet been able to reach a consensus on the proposal.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
So, new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße soon.
But it is not just housing.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to permanent residence, it is necessary to find or set up traineeships, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants.
"More seats would be good", reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction industry or help housekeepers, doing charity work - and doing so with motivation and orderliness, reports Annika Deuschle.
She hopes that the work for the community will have a positive impact.
I said, "This is not employment therapy".
But activity is not just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and Kunde.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs things like sports, contact with the locals and, most importantly, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, the administration and volunteers are stepping in.
It is essential that refugees feel welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it's just a matter of time and that they can make sense of the time, for example by taking language courses.
If you ever feel that you can't help anyone in Urbach, you can't work and you're useless, you'll never integrate.
The clear majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says Kunde frankly, "people who can't do anything".
He said it was all a "mommy job".
A difficult question: after the recent incidents, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No", says Regine, "which some may call naïve".
The aid workers are already aware of this.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
They'd be afraid the assassins would completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it", says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, main and volunteer workers need to look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always keep in mind that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
The question is one that politicians are reluctant to answer.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go", says Annika Deuschle.
No more refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the urban residents are already busy integrating the people they have met.
There are now about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, if you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complex that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Helicopter burglar wanted
The police helicopter flew over various areas for about an hour - without success.
Two unidentified men broke into an apartment in a multi-family home in Lindenweg on Friday morning at about 8:50 a.m.
The inhabitant surprised the two and drove the unruly one away.
The two men were about 5'6" to 5'7" tall, well-masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city center.
The police deployed several patrol crews and a police helicopter to search for the man.
The search was unsuccessful.
The unknowns may have been spotted near the apartment or on the run.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on food
After an attack on an Ulm snack bar, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of the peace.
During house searches, evidence and drugs were found, police said Friday.
Police say around 20 masked men from a rock-like group threw bottles and stones at the window of a convenience store in July.
After that, they allegedly attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
After that, they fled.
The damage to the food court and the adjacent building was estimated at EUR 10,000.
Investigators believe it was a fight in the Ulm rocker district between a Kurdish gang and a Turkish gang.
