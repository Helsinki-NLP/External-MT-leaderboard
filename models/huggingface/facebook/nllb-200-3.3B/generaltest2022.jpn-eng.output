I don't think I'm gonna watch TV again because of that.
Does that mean that the comedian is forced to do it?
I saw a lot of birds yesterday on Netflix, but there are a lot of scenes where the staff laughs and giggles behind the scenes when they say something that isn't particularly funny.
It's not funny, but it's not funny to laugh at everything you say.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer's mood will be ruined, and the work will be unpleasant.
It's like the old black industry, where the whole industry is like a gym, and some of the entertainers are just too egotistical and they're just acting like they're normally nasty, and they're not going to eat.
On the other hand, there is a lot of talk about "don't screw the artists" as the artists themselves seem to exaggerate the difficulty of their work.

Summary: When I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper, I got a wired version of the mouse, and I was told that if I wanted a refund, I had to return it.
I'm not going to go into the whole "self-made" problem, but I'm going to say that it's a bit of a problem because it's not a very good idea, and it's not a very good idea, and it's a very popular topic, so I'll just leave it there.
The story began when he discovered that a wireless gaming mouse from MSI was being sold for 3,280 yen at a Toku-mo-net shop's Toku-mo Day sale that began last Friday.
The price was the same as the cable version at the store, so I ordered it considering the possibility of not being a mistake, considering the price error and also checking the cable version page.
I got the order mail, and the next day I got the shipping mail.
In both of these emails and on my purchase history, the name of the company was CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS.
And I thought that this was the point when the wireless mouse that I had ordered arrived, because there was no error message or cancellation notice until the order was shipped.
And that's where the problem is, because a few hours after the shipment, I got an email saying, "There's been a registration error".
According to the e-mail,
I was selling the wireless version at a discount, but it was actually a wired version.
So, we're going to do this in the next few days.
Rejected and canceled.
2. Return the mouse only and get it back.

And if you're going to do that, you're going to have to either accept the money or you're going to have to fight back.

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rain erase the only bridge to the district. Residents triple their food reserves
Matsumoto Hoshiro is from the Takayama area of Yamagata City, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of three families of eight.
Masumoto: At first, it was like, "Really?"
The only road leading to the Hachihara district, the Hachihara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 families of 11 residents in the area isolated.
The residents, who were forced to cut off the water, spent days transporting the necessary supplies using the JR iron bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Mr. Matsumoto: "You could normally see cars coming to the yard, and you could see them coming to you from the side, or you could see them coming to you from behind, and you could see them coming to you from the side, and you could see them coming to you from behind, and you could see the traffic and the cars coming to you from behind".
After more than two years of recovery, Matsumoto continues to take the necessary steps.
I think there are about 10 cases.
In the meantime, I'm hoping to have something to eat for two or three days".
Masumoto: "I feel that you should save a little because you don't know when disaster will strike you, not someone else's business".
To remember the lessons, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
The head of the Department of Education and the Department of the Higher School of Science at Yayoi City: "We have decided to establish the day of prevention of disasters in Yayoi City", and we want to make October 12th a day to think about preparation for disasters.
I think we're more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen".

And the participants said, "It was a very different and very fun experience".
"It's hard to run and run in the streets of Tokyo, but it's fun to run and run and I'm glad I did it while competing with everyone else". The city official said, "We want to have a sports gym and so on in the future".

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
The trap of the building inspection system is the diamond online.
● The new "building survey" system aimed at stimulating the second-hand housing market is doing well in the second-hand housing market.
The prices of houses and apartments are rising, and the renovation market is expanding.
While the coronavirus pandemic has increased home ownership, the rising "before-station/near-station/straight-line", "large", and "tower" terms have also been influenced by the sharp decline in popularity and relatively inexpensive new construction.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (middle- and second-hand) housing in Japan is still at a low level.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land Transport and Transport (MELT) initiated a building survey called inspection, aimed at partially amending the Land and Building Trading Law and ensuring the safety and security of second-hand homes.
This is a system whereby an architect who is familiar with a home, checks the current state and condition of the building, including deterioration, and presents it to the buyer in a report.
The Ministry of Finance explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller can avoid post-delivery claims by doing a survey of the item before the sale and purchase, and can give the buyer a sense of security.
It also leads to differentiation of competing objects.
On the one hand, the buyer also believes that it is a system that can be understood and bought convincingly in the state of the second-hand house that is to be purchased, and that it is a system that has great benefits.
However, the systematic and building situation investigation in the current system is primarily the responsibility of the seller.
In addition, I would like to note that the only notification of the system called inspection has become mandatory.
So, the real estate agent who is doing the mediation, is obliged to explain that they can or they can't refer an architect to do the building inspection, but they don't have to do it.
The risk of a vendor-led inspection is a concern. On the other hand, if we look abroad, the US and the UK, where the second-hand market is active, have already established similar systems.
In the pre-sale phase, buyers hire a professional called an inspector or a building surveyor to inspect the building.
In the United States, for example, 70 to 90 percent of all second-hand home transactions are inspected, depending on the state.
The main Japanese inspection and its nature are very different from the "seller" main inspection, in that the "buyer" is the one who leads the inspection.
The seller wants to show the building in a better condition, as high as possible, and sell it quickly.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to study the investigation, make the appropriate repairs and live in peace.
Even if it's the same inspection, there's a mismatch between the two objectives.
Therefore, the following points are pointed out as a risk of concern for the Japanese system:
● The scope of the inspection of the seller-led type set by the state will be kept to a minimum.
The inspection company may also be a customer of the intermediary company (the seller) who presents the case.
Therefore, the seller may not report any unfavorable findings, or may be subject to "slow" inspections.

The return of the Shinno-Fuji, the revival of the Daigaku, or the Shizuoka family "more than the three of us now"... Daily newspaper 2021/3/31
And when I look at the photo in this article, I wonder if the middle one is the middle one.
"I hope that the successor of the former emperor will be an inspiration and example for many people".
Oh, you're on the stage.
It's hard to break a knee, and it's hard to ride a horse.
The Silver was an island?
I'm not going to talk about it.
"This was once a peninsula.
And to prove it, I can show you a little trivia, if I'm not a Genghis.
I'm going to share some of the most interesting things about the zodiac that I know that I'm sure someone will want to know.
You're going to the top of the silver throne!
First entry into the zodiac.
As you walk around the Ginza, you will see strange landmarks, mysterious monuments, and numerous shrines, all of which are the shadows of the history that the Ginza region has left behind.
I was walking with her on the silver throne, and I said to the sudden silence, "This is the old peninsula.
Ginza was once a peninsula?
The name of the street that gave birth to the "○○ Ginza" in various parts of Japan, and the name of the street in the central part of Tokyo, "Ginza".
The term "Ginza" originally referred to the silver coinage of Edo, but in 1612, the Ginza office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Exchange Town", but after it was moved to the city of Shells, it became known as "Silver City".
By the way, once upon a time, the area around Ginza was a peninsula jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, the peninsula called "Edo Front Island" stretched from Japan to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now called Ginza.
The Tokugawa family established a shogunate in Edo, and began to fill in the river and improve the Kishi district.
He also established the city's quarter and the harbor to develop the shipping industry.
And he's been clearing up the dirt and the mountains of Shinto, and he's been filling up the river.
However, there is a "Ginza origin" stone that shows the location of the Ginza office in the vicinity of the Tiffany Ginza store (central area Ginza 2-7) so you should look for it if you are interested.
The Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the Silver Star, as you all know.
The annual "Sacred Land Pilgrimage" is held in Ginza, known to all as the "Ginza Octave Shrine Pilgrimage".
Of the more than ten shrines, the most easily seen is the "Kabuki-Inoha Shrine" in front of the Kabuki-Inoha Shrine.
The company that stands at the right end of the Kabuki stage is frequented by many people before and after the theatre.
On the other hand, "Donggukyo Inmyo-ji" is on the roof of the Ginza-san's house, and "Ginza-shi-ji" is on the Ginza-san's terrace on the ninth floor of the Ginza-san's third floor.
The "Toyo-wa-Rincho Shrine" is located in the back of the street, but it is difficult to see. The "Toyo-wa-Rincho Shrine" is known for being venerated by the famous Kabukian, the city of Hanashiwa, and the "Rincho Shrine" is located in the Ginza Lantern Building 1F entrance. The "Successful Rincho Shrine" is not open to the public except for the time of the "Akiting Shrine" ceremony.
The temple is also home to the worship of the Imjin-shiro and the Shiji-shiro, but most of the shrines are dedicated to the Shinto god of rice.
The "Rice Company" greeted by the fox in front of the house was built in the village, where there are many farmers, with the benefit of "Rice Rich" rice, which is often milled.
As a result, the faith spread in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, where it was said that there was a profit from the prosperity of commerce, and in the most populous city in Japan, Ginza.

Korea Postco International has acquired China's Senex Energy, expanded its offshore gas field business, and is in the process of acquiring a new oil and gas company in the country.
On 12 December, POSCO International announced that it had entered into an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire shares in Senex Energy, a state-owned company in the state of Hawaii.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in March of next year, pending approval by the Senex Energy shareholders' meeting and approval of the local corporation.
The acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) since Posco International was merged into the Posco Group in 2010.
The purchase price is 77.09 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas has been increasing steadily in the energy transition era, and that the blue hydrogen base of natural gas in the hydrogen market will divide the market with green hydrogen, and decided to make this acquisition.
With this acquisition, Posco International will acquire 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in South Korea, and will also acquire onshore gas field operations personnel in the Ho Chi Minh City area.

The knee pain, or maybe the "squamous knee arthritis"?
The cause of the disease is not known.
Editor's note: I've been having some bad knee pain lately.
What kind of disease is it?
Dr. Masuyama: There are many causes of knee pain, such as injuries, rheumatic joint pain, seizures, etc.
Among them, the most common Japanese disease is "deformed arthritis".
ED: So you're saying that the joints are going to deform?
Dr. Haruki: Yes, that is correct.
The surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which acts to soften the impact and smooth the movement of the joint.
But with age, obesity, and extreme sports, it can become thinner and more distorted.
And as a result, it causes joint deformity and inflammation.
ED: Does rheumatoid arthritis affect anything other than the knee?
I'm not sure.
It can occur in joints other than the knee, such as the kneecap, the kneecap, the neck, the waist, the thumb, the thigh, and so on.
But the most common case is in the knee, and it's called "deformed knee arthritis".
Editors: What is the structure of the joint anyway?
Dr. Maruyama: The joint is a joint where two bones join together.
And the two joints are facing each other, and they're covered by the articular cartilage, and the joint is surrounded by the articular sheath.
Editor: It's a very complicated structure.
I'm not sure.
The inner layer of the articular capsule contains a tissue called the mucous membrane, which makes the articular fluid.
This joint fluid is a lubricant, and it's made up of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That's why they say, "To smooth the motion of the knee, hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate is better".
Editor: What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: The articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and its function is to prevent the bones from directly colliding with each other.
So, you know, it's kind of like a cushion.
But when it gets thinned out, it distorts the joint, it inflames it, and it causes pain.

The excitement is overwhelming...
The first game in the series, "The Real Game", was released in Japan on June 6, 2010.
The Kaji series is a popular series of male-centric gambling comics.
One of the most popular aspects of this book is the extreme game of life.
I'm afraid to cross the Iron Curtain, just to look at the pictures of the sword.
So this time I want to examine the games that we can play or that we can see in our project videos.
The "Swamp" is a trap-filled patchwork of "Swamp" that appears in "The Gambling Delinquent Cage".
The original was a $1,000-a-ball game that surprised Cage.
The swamp was a forest of nails, a mobile object, a huge trap of three-tiered clowns, and it was almost impossible to attack.
But Kaji used every hand he could get his hands on, and finally he put a vinyl tank on the building and started the rough work of sinking the floor, and he captured it beautifully.
The "Mummy" that appeared in Kaiji actually appears as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, it's not "4,000 yen per one", but it's lowered the difficulty level, so you can get a taste of Kaiji's feeling.
The "Human Race Horse" is the "Iron Cross" that the rich have made the debtors, including Kaiji, perform at the "Starside Party" held as a pastime.
The debtor must keep his speed to a minimum, so as not to fall over the thin iron bar set ten meters above the ground.
Twelve people can participate, and the top two can win the prize money, but there are only four pieces of steel, and there are insufficient safety measures, and the risk of death is quite high.
This is a high-risk, but developed as a VR game, and can be experienced very close to the Eagle Bridge, installed in the home of the Golden Eagles of Pro Baseball, Tokushima, Akita Life Park Palace.
This is the Eagle Bridge, a steel bridge that rises to a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building), and is preceded by the "Sky Blanco" and the "Victory Bridge" that are prepared and walked.
Of course, there are security measures.
Comedian Koala Jiro Storm became a topic on his YouTube channel after posting a video of him walking across the Eagle Bridge, saying that "the Iron Bridge can be experienced in Japan".
The game is a two-player card game called E-Cards.
The player is dealt one emperor card, eight citizens cards, and ten slaves cards, divided into emperor and slave.
This is a very well-crafted game, with the emperor stronger than the citizen, the citizen stronger than the slave, the slave stronger than the emperor.
Kaiji is pitted against Lien River in the play, with the strict rule "If you lose, you cut off your own ear".
After the Great Purge, Kaiji, who realized that an ear-destroying device like an earphone attached to his ear was reading his mind by sensing and transmitting pulse and body temperature changes, confused and won the Liiga River by cutting his ears to the extreme and abnormal body values.
E-cards are available for purchase on Amazon and other online retailers.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him competing in the E-card with Fujita Toriyama, who played Kaji in the film.
▪ How can you feel like a Kaji?
It is not a common thing to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is a fact that reading a comic book can make you feel like a little person.
You can feel that worldview through the game.
A step to the new year, a gentle push.
The new year preparations are underway in the prefecture of the Shinjuku Shrine, where a large painted horse called "" appeared.
On the 11th, students from the East North College of Arts and Technology visited the shrine and held a dedication ceremony before the god.
The temple has been commissioning a master craftsman to paint the original painting of the horse since last year.
This time, nine artists from the Japanese Painting Course taught by Professor Meru Yongamin were selected.
The main arch is 3.3 meters wide and the center is about 1.8 meters high.
He described the image as "a cherry that gently pushes the back of the new year".
He wished that the tiger, who stops and looks at the cherry blossoms, "may have the luxury of admiring the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world".
The design of the house is also depicted on the commonly distributed picture horse.
Chiya Henkyo, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, said, "I think all people can help us overcome difficulties".

I'm going to suggest to you to think about "Yokoo I Want to Live On"
What kind of town will Yuno be in 2030?
A group of representatives from four high schools in Yuno City are working on a workshop on "Yuno I Want to Live".
As part of the research and policy recommendations of the Yūno SDGs Mihon-Dekkyū Center, a support organization, the youth's voice is collected and presented to mayors.
"What's the fun part?"
The facilitator's questions are answered by the student, "When you're having fun with a crowd", "When you're playing the drums", and so on.
The first round was held on 13 November at the Shifudai Hall.
The World Café approach, where 18 high school students and community members travel around the island, each with a theme, to talk about interesting cities, livable cities, and cities that feel alive.
Each idea was written on a sticker, and then put on a piece of paper and put it together.
"A city with a lot of young people is fun". "Ease of living depends on transportation, such as trains and buses".
We'll talk about it later.
"I thought Yūno was boring, but it's fascinating to be able to cycle along the sea", said Yūno, a senior third-year student in the Yūno Business School (age 18).
Baen-Shan-Guo, a third-year student, said that there are fewer shops, traffic is inconvenient, and nature is rich. By talking to each other, the adults realized not only the challenges of the area, but also the attraction.
The second time in December, it was just high school students who gathered to sort out the content of the proposal.
We're going to invite the mayors and the heads of the schools to announce it in February.
The director of the center, Tori Ye, says that "the aim is to foster the love of the country among high school students and encourage young people to become actively involved in urban development".
The earthquake was measured at a magnitude of 4.0 and M5.0 in Kanto, south of Izu.
At around 0:31 pm on the 12th, a magnitude 4 earthquake occurred in the provinces of Chiba, Hakone, Ma, and Yamagata.
According to the meteorological agency, the earthquake was centered in the southern part of the city of Yuzuka and the depth of the epicenter was about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated at 5.0 on the Richter scale.
I'm not worried about the tsunami.
The earthquake intensity in each area is as follows:

How to find the new wrapper in the stolen
A necessary winter stool, but is there no time to weave a cloth under the neck?
And then, when you're done, you can look in the mirror and try to balance it, but you can hear the voice saying, "I don't know what the fuck this is".
I thought I'd have a stool that didn't stick to the cloth, but I found something new.
The "COTTORI" brand of stools is approximately one meter long and more compact than the usual ones.
When I first saw it, I was like, "How can you be so short and curly?"
And he saw the net, and behold, it was made in the form of a net, and all the work of the net was in the form of a net.
The end of the net is to allow the end of the sturgeon to pass through.
So you can keep it in a loop without having to connect the ends.
It's very light and warm.
This year, the jacket without sleeves is popular, but many people wear it in combination with a stool to keep their shoulders from getting cold.
I think it would be useful to have a chair like this.
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

I'm not going to be able to do this, because I'm not going to be able to do this, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that, because I'm not going to be able to do that.
I don't like to fight with you, but I'm not so much of a fighter, but I'm in a really good mood, and I'm like, "Well, we're not going to work together anymore", and I think the Beatles were like that, and it's kind of a fun, sort of, sort of, break-up of legends.
And when you start playing in that air, everybody's really brilliant.
It's a terrible thing to start with a little phrase and then go from there to the end of the song.
I'm not even sure I'm going to get to see the movie.
And it's amazing how the song's lyrics are so well-recorded, that the nasal song, the hum hum hum hum hum hum, is slowly going into that hum hum.
I'm sorry to see you in the middle of a composition like this.
And then, of course, everyone's fat, so I'm happy just to see the performance.
I'm going to tell you this story, and it's the first of three, but so far, the biggest reason for the break up was the environment, not the Beatles themselves.
And I'm always having fun when the four of us start making songs and we're always complaining about things, but when I was talking about what to do with the live venue, it was easy to see that the producers and the publicists were saying things like, "Oh, the Beatles are the best band in the world!" and saying, "Oh, they're getting away from the real thing".
Well, the documentary has its own director's interpretation, so maybe that's what Peter Jackson felt.
And I thought maybe that's why Paul's in jail and he's the bad guy.

I was told that I couldn't do it, but I think that if I find something in myself that I can do, then my life will be a little easier.
← Of course, I think it's good to think about this when you're relaxed and relaxed.
But I think that there are some things in everyday life that if you have a union, or a doctor or a window where you can consult, if you are consulted by them, or if there is some kind of system, then you might want to consult once.
I hope that we can live a little more comfortably in the future.

The effects of unseasonal heat and cold weather on the United States' tornado-prone population
A series of tornadoes struck the southern United States between Friday night 10 and Saturday night 11 local time.
The atmosphere was very unstable during this period, and the clouds formed rapidly.
In the southern United States, warm air from the southwest has been pouring in, setting a record high.
The hottest temperatures in Houston, Texas, on Thursday and Friday, 9 and 10 local time, have risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
This record-setting warmth, along with the strong cold winds of less than 30°C (5500 m) above the horizon, has caused the formation of an active front due to the large temperature difference, and the rapid development of the clouds in the form of a front line.
The tornadoes have been seen to be forming in the vicinity.
The southern United States is a particularly vulnerable area to tornadoes, but the high season is in early summer, and there is little damage during this time.
The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record number.
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported more than 400 tornadoes and other storms in just 10 days (Friday) local time.
This shows that there are two large, concentrated areas of the southern line, from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest of six on the EF scale, and was believed to have been blowing forward and backward at 70 m/s.
It may be possible to determine EF4 to EF5 based on future research.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, based on the Fujita scale, adapted to the conditions of Japanese architecture.
The JEF3 equivalent of this American tornado is also very likely to occur in Japan, where wooden houses will collapse.

Live calls for help from under the "greatest" tornado in history
On the damage caused by tornadoes in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden explained on the 11th (12th Japanese time) that "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States" with a strange face.
CNN and others reported that
Biden stressed that "the federal government will do everything".
"We don't know yet how many lives were lost or the full extent of the damage", he explained.
There are more than 100 deaths in the city.
In the state of Kentucky, which was hit by the tornado, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, between the night of the 10th and the 11th, as residents transport household items from damaged houses.
The damage range of the tornado remains, with records of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) damaging Missouri and other states in 1925. CNN's meteorologist estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) and the maximum size.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, the largest of the affected areas, the candle factory was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season.
The building was destroyed and left without a trace.
In the darkness, a woman, immobilized under a snowstorm about one and a half meters thick, felt the weight of the rescuers searching over the snowstorm and called for help via a live Facebook broadcast on her mobile phone.
The live broadcast included the screams of women calling for help, as well as the crying and crying of another woman who apparently sang "Happy Birthday to You" to distract the fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son, due to a tornado warning.
"Most people sounded like trains, but more like earthquakes, like something exploding", he recalled.
Mayfield Police officers will continue to search until the search is no longer necessary.
"We don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take", he said, but he continued his hard-fought rescue efforts.
In Illinois, a warehouse of the online retailer Amazon collapsed, killing at least six people.
The highway is blocked by a series of shocks, including the derailment of train cars, and the overturning of vehicles on the highway.
According to the US Web media, about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, were without power.

What does it mean to be a doctor in gynecology?
A "doctor" is a doctor who has been a doctor for three to five years.

The term "stage doctor" refers to the first or second year of medical training after graduation.

It's been said that there are different ways of thinking about the star system.
The argument is that Japan is adding or subtracting three stars as a neutral, while other countries are adding or subtracting five stars as a reference.
At the point of reference, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars means something completely different than "there is a downside" and "not a masterpiece but a masterpiece".
If you give it five stars, it's going to be "the best of all" and "the only one without any flaws". If you have that tendency, I think it's a systemic flaw that doesn't give you a star, but it's the way it's run in the system, so I don't want you to give it three stars.
So it's not really fair to those who are arguing this kind of argument to try to refute it with a second-hand assessment of Steam.

"So that you can taste the restaurant feeling at home", Mr. and Mrs. Shin Hashimoto opened last August.
One of the popular menus for the dinner is "Fish fry and ebay fry from the seasons caught in the nearby sea" (YEN 1000)
The fish choose the good stuff at the market.
"Fry is the way to make the raw bread dough as thin as possible so that the taste of the material is known". (Shuji) "Fry is the way to make the raw bread dough as thin as possible so that the taste of the material is known".
The menu includes four kinds of vegetables and deli, rice from the Hino Hikaari of Sago Prefecture, and a meal of rice and soup.
Vegetables are produced in the nearby fields and in the provinces.
The side dishes vary from season to season, but the chef is French, and the dishes are lape and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a "relieving taste" like scrambled eggs, and a "pacifying taste" that a wide generation can enjoy.

Overall, not bad, but there's still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it's easier to use if there are fewer people or if you have to be careful to get to the edge.
And I thought, well, I'll just make a special lane, so that it doesn't get in the way of other people.
But I thought it would be a good ride if there were fewer people because it was so relaxing, and it would be a nice way to slow down and enjoy the scenery.
The excitement of the near-future, the excitement of the prospect of autonomous driving becoming mainstream in the future, the pain of the surrounding view, was a difficult ride for the comfortable, rather patient mind.
I was fucking embarrassed.

A man was beheaded and escaped on a man's motorcycle 12 days ago. Murder attempted in a large property in the city of Soka, Japan.
On 12th, at about 1:25 am, on the first street of the Sagawa City, a 40-year-old man in Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a blade by a man believed to be 30 or 40 years old, and suffered a wound to the face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saganan police are pursuing him as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Station, there was a passing by who said "I'm having a fight".
The man has a wound on his left side about four inches long and about an inch deep, and he is conscious.
The escaped man is flesh and skinhead.
A knife believed to be used in the crime was found near the scene.
The man was drinking with several acquaintances, and there was some traffic trouble between the man on the pedestrian and the man on the bike.

The family's long journey to establish environmental activism in China's outskirts
(Find Asia, Hong Kong) China is a vast country, important in terms of biodiversity, the number one in the world for the number of species of mammals and the third largest number of plant species.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote environmental activism, as well as environmental protection.
The Sichuan province of Yunnan, located in southwestern China, is one such region.
Sisapanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The Mekong River flows through the Southeast Asian countries.
The Sichuan Sichuan Autonomous Region covers only 0.2% of China's land area, but is home to about 25% of the country's wildlife and 20% of its plant species.
This time, we have a chance to talk to Mr. Li Zhiong, who is an environmental activist in Sisabana, about what he saw and what he did.
I started working with my German husband on environmental issues -- I started working on environmental issues 20 years ago.
What was the impetus?
Mr. Lee, our environmental campaign "Tyan" started in 2000.
It was my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany, and he's here in Siena for a joint UN-Chinese science project.
This was the only rainforest region in China, and it boasted a significant biodiversity.
But at the same time, economic development was lagging behind.
So, to establish industry in the region, to produce rubber that China lacked, they started to clear the rainforest on a large scale.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study the recovery of natural resources and biological resources.
And then I met and married a reporter who was here.
- Before that, Mr. Lee was not interested in conservation?
Mr. Lee, I'm from Sisa-pan, and I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or biodiversity.
So she and her husband had to go on with the project without knowing it.
And I've seen people who don't have a very nice face, or a very tall face, but they have an aura, and I wonder why.
A popular actor once said,
The aura is not something that comes out.
It's a natural thing that happens when you have confidence in yourself.
I'm sure that person has a strong inner confidence.

The MOD is the environmental cause of CTD, and it took about a month and a half to identify it.
The stable data until March was not taken much time to play since GW, and the CTD due to multiple factors was occurring, and it took a very steady amount of time, as I looked at it only a little bit at the holiday center.
Why didn't the .Net Script Framework analyze the logs? (I'll see in a few minutes) Some of the errors in the .dll series or mesh relationship don't stay in the crash logs.
0 timing of the main CTD
* All papyri and .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins that leave logs, do not leave a trace in the log.
* Some NPC kill/attack accumulation time: triggered by console kill→Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree SE update) OFF) improved ※ Is there a chance of wet clothes for this?
* When the kill-moving camera works on some NPCs, the kill-moving setting is OFF. Basic improvement in OFF via ini: DAR+Nemesis relationship is set to compete? The maximum number of DAR animations is not even 10,000.
* (basic outdoor) field movement + some magic examples (cold loon) activation, NPC hit time: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application settings (MCM right) all OFF with 5 consecutive trials and improvement.
Is this due to some extra guarding and shader setting errors in the actor/NPC body mesh? Also, 2.0's SPID usage is the default. Ini has a written error, but as a result it is the intended result and the NPCs are supposed to have the premise Perk applied.
At first, we focused on the check by putting on wet clothes for the local attack and OnHit related motion/combat MOD (of .dll) and the result was something like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least not in English, German or French.
I was asked to post this because I thought it might be useful as a reminder if there are any people in the Japanese-speaking world who have similar CTD problems.
And I'm not going to do it because I'm not a good person.
And the people around you don't notice it, not even your colleagues or family.
And I look around and I think, "Well, he's doing well, he's working hard".
But he's probably mentally retarded, too.
I don't consider myself a retired mentalist, but I think I was just about the limit before I retired.
I'm going to talk to you about the importance of visiting psychiatric nurses.
I have bipolar disorder, and I've been a visiting nurse for a long time, and I think I have a long and very good relationship with the nurse in the visiting nurse station that I use now.
We talk about it every week.
And of course, they do the drug management -- the packaging -- but most of all, I think the visiting nurse today really showed how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today we're also discussing gender inequality and gendered issues.
She talks about the sexuality of men and women, how she got divorced, and if she can do that as a visiting nurse.
Sometimes, I'm dressed as a woman.
But I have heard from people who know that in the case of the visiting nursing station run by psychiatric hospitals, the nurse aunt who can not work in the ward comes and only takes care of administrative matters, or the visiting nurse comes and the occupational therapist says, "I do this because I do healthcare".
I'm using a small visiting nurse station run by a social services corporation, and I think she's a really good nurse who's going to be equal to me with a mental illness, and Frank.
And by the way, she's beautiful.
I'm sure some of you have been in psychiatric care, and some of you are thinking about going.
Visiting nurses are very helpful to people with mental illness.
If the doctor agrees, I'll take it.
And, choose a good visiting nurse station.
In the past, I've had to cancel contracts because I couldn't get enough of them.

The South Korean patent for hydrogen technology, one-fifth of China's... "Hydrogen economy roadmap delayed in fulfillment".
The South Korean government has announced the 2019 Hydrogen Economy Roadmap.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation by 2022 and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilo.
But this year, fuel cell cars are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units) by November standards.
The hydrogen station deployment schedule for the core infrastructure is 38% of the target (about 117 stations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is 8,400 watts, which is not much different from the time of the road map announcement.
The government's hydrogen economy roadmap has been found to be far below target.
The National Economic Association (NEA) released a report on the "Current state of the hydrogen economy and policy direction" on 12th.
The report says that the core components of the hydraulic industry are largely dependent on the US and Japan.
The core material of the fuel cell vehicle is carbon fiber, the catalyst is platinum, the membrane is DuPont, Goa, and 3M.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the world hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
South Korea is the world's fifth largest country in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (accumulated between 2014 and 2020).
But the whole thing is that "the fact that the top six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market means that they are actually behind the competition".
The ranking of countries is China, the United States, the European Union, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become the world's number one, and it's widening the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 is 22 percent of China's 4721 patents, with Korea ranked fourth with 1,033 patents, ahead of Japan (974).
The full-linearity proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'National Strategic Technology' with a large tax deduction for investment and research and development costs".

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, troops also engaged in training
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that by Dec. 12, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance program approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth 60 million dollars, and by the beginning of the year, the last equipment, including four radars that identify the launching points of mortars and other weapons, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to US Defense Department spokesman Kirby, this aid included lethal weapons such as the Jabberlain anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen the national defense capability of Ukraine, which has received military reinforcements from the Russian army around the border with Ukraine.
The US is increasing its vigilance over Russian military movements, and is consulting with NATO members to prepare for a response if Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden had approved the arms aid on September 1 of this year, when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House.
The United States military aid to Ukraine this year amounted to about 450 million dollars.
Russia's total aid since the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Ukraine has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also involved in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the US sent troops from Florida to Ukraine as part of a multinational joint training program to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special operations forces operating in Ukraine is not a matter of operational confidentiality.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on 7th of this month, which included a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also shown a willingness to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of invasion.

The way in which the inheritance and gift tax "revised" makes lifetime gifts "forbidden", and the way in which the former tax commissioner of the Kuomintang Party, Liangming, was shot!
The first special edition of the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond, "Family Talk at the Beginning of the Year!
It's called "the gift of life and the heirloom".
As the discussion of the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax continues, the concerned 2022 fiscal tax reform master plan was sent, but in the near future, the possibility of a "forbidden hand" for the royal line of inheritance tax measures is very likely.
How will the rules of succession change?
With a direct hit to the former tax commissioner of the LDP, Senator Ghanim, the basic techniques of gifts and inheritance for gifts and inheritance for gifts and gifts in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in time, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, out, in, in, in, in, out, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, out, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, out, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in,
(Diamond editorial office)
● "Prohibiting" the use of lifetime gifts from property owners to urban corporate employees to "carry out serious consideration towards the creation of a tax system that is neutral in the choice of the time of transfer of assets from the point of view of taxing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated manner".
The party's 2021 fiscal year tax reform plan, which was released last year, caused a major upset not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because what it means is that you are trying to change the rules of inheritance, and you are trying to increase the inheritance tax by making the "pre-marital gift" the king of inheritance tax measures.
The rule of thumb for tax saving in a highly progressive estate tax is "to reduce the taxable estate".
The most powerful of these is the gift of life, which has been widely used by the wealthy, of course, and even corporate employees who incur a small inheritance tax by owning a home in the metropolitan area.
The debate on the unification of inheritance and gift taxes arose.
Although the 22nd annual tax reform plan announced on December 10 was feared to be introduced as soon as possible, the policy towards integration was re-stated in more advanced terms, such as "reviewing the current system of taxation at the time of inheritance and the existence of the system of calendar year gifts", "The non-taxation of gift tax measures are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount, and therefore we will continue to review them".
In an interview with the editorial office, former chairman of the tax system investigation committee of the People's Liberation Party, former director General Ghanli Ming said:
"It is most important to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer of property and to keep the tax burden the same whenever you go".
And we're trying to simulate what the problem is going to be, and if we can fix it, we'll have three chances left in life.
If not, we will certainly be making a big move in the near future to eliminate the gift of life as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift taxes change?

The team that won the NFL championship by passing three times, the players, how did they feel?
In this game, Jones has only thrown three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest in the NFL in the last 50 years, since the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
The 1974 Bills had a legendary RB, O.J. Simpson, who had the first-ever 2000-yard season in franchise history the previous season.
The Bills had beaten the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB, Jim Blackstone.
The weather was the main reason why Pietriots had to make such an extreme offense.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, and the latitude is the same as the Hokkaido junction.
And on this day, the temperature was almost 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18 meters, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills were the only home team that didn't change their play selections much.
He's got 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen's pass is 15-30 and 145 yards.
There was no intercept, and it was never impossible.
Four red zone breaches and a scoring touchdown in a 10-game offensive series.
Especially since the end of Q3, when we went to the red zone three times in a row.
But I only got three points for the first FG.
The last goal of the game was scored by the defense.
The Bills, who were chasing the fourth, missed a penalty at 3rd and 9 and finished 3rd and 14th.
It's 18 yards to the goal.
3rd and 14 QB Allen, surrounded by a rush of Pete Riots defense, out of the pocket and running right.
And he threw a pass to end zone TE Dawson Knox, but it failed.
In this play, the right-footed Aether WR Stefon Diggs ran the shallows and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen did not see it.
4th and 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of the left end zone, but the pass was knocked out by the Detroit Pistons' DB Miles Bryant.
Bryant was covering WR Cole Beasley for the Bills, but was responding to passes by releasing Beasley when he saw Allen's movements.
Allen missed both receivers, and both times he threw passes to the end zone.
The fourth down pass may have been a home run, but the third down didn't need to be a TD.
You can take the first down in two plays.
There were still two minutes left, so if he had made it the fourth and short, Allen would have had the ability to make his own run.
I'm not going to do it.

It's time to throw out the "throwaway" & "turn-off" items that you'll be leaving in your kitchen for a long time.
Sponge, please.
No matter how often you change it, you probably don't replace it as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can reproduce a lot of bacteria even if they are sterilized with an electronic oven every day.
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend that sponges be changed once a week to keep them clean.
The board.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that if the panels begin to scratch, crawl, or crack, they should be replaced.
Once the wound or groove is there, it's harder to clean it, and bacteria can multiply.
If you are still safe, remember to disinfect frequently with a tablespoon of a solution of an unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon of water.
Soak the surface of the flat plate in the liquid for a few minutes.
The water is then washed in a clean water, dried naturally, or cut and dried as if it were a light towel with a clean paper towel.
Missing or broken utensils
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the missing surface is a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
And it can also cause you to cut your lips for missing parts, or spill your drink.
Yeah, a chance to buy a new and beloved mug!
Submersion by the Japanese

"You can't be killed by a tiger tank".
"Ow" is the word.
"You can't die if you drink the water from the Han River".
"Ow" is the word.
"So you can do three hours of underwater bridge?"
"Shut up and shut up".
"Then you must train to endure until the next battle of the Crusades!"
"Wow!" He said.
"Because of the promise?"
"Ooh, I got it!"
"You may be killed by Cao Cao someday, but I don't know!"
After saying that, the sergeant went home.
Of course, you can't practice underwater bridge if you're not bound and handcuffed and locked in a cage.

I went to the BIOS settings screen, saved the settings, and when I restarted, the white cursor on the black screen didn't flash, but it was still blinking.
If you try to rewrite the BIOS with FlashBIOS, thinking it's broken, it won't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it's supposed to be five minutes, but it's not even an hour.
I think it's because I'm trying to get the USB memory to be too old and I'm trying to swap it for an SD card.

Is there any other cause?

Why is rice a little cheaper this year than last year?
Because there is no richness, no consumption.
As a producer, I'm done with it.

So let's start with the sample set.
The True Beauty Hair Care Line, which leads to the hair you really want.
I'm ashamed to have a brand name.
If it's not a big deal, I'll have it, but I don't have it, because it's like a Veton or something, and it's written Lv in a monogram.
Why is that?
I think it's best to match your height.
By the way, I think Japan is fine.
Japan is a country.
It's not about the wind.
You better say it early, "Why are you calling me/screaming?"
If you say, "I'm not interested in being a foreigner", you should simply say, "I'm not comfortable".
I don't think I ever dreamed of being uncomfortable with the odds.
I was living abroad, but the Japanese who went abroad, including me, hated the upper and lower Japanese rituals and sometimes they thought that the people who came here were here and that they could say anything to the locals.
If you look at Westerners, they're not just being mean, they're just being kind of sweet or careless.
My friends in the West call me by my middle name, but sometimes I'm a little confused about which one to use when speaking in Japanese.
I'm glad we're friends, though.
I'm sure you're just being normal, but I'd better say it now because if you're too careful, you might not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because you're a geijin.
I'm sorry, but I'm Japanese, so I can't talk to you according to Japanese rules.
I don't mind, but my white friends who go home always raise their glasses higher than other people when they drink at a party.
I'm sure you are aware of this, but I think it's a good habit to do this because it doesn't make you look weird, or it makes you look Japanese.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are full of such details.
I'm going to be doing this for the next couple of weeks.
The case is a superior one.

50 subscribers, thank you!
I just got off the Reddit and I saw that this new Sabre I made has crossed 50 subscribers.
I'm very pleased.
Thank you for subscribing!
I had 25 subscribers yesterday, and I thought it would take a little while to get to 50, but somehow, 25 subscribers today alone.
I would really appreciate it if you could tell me where you got this in the comments section!
I'm the only one who's doing the math right now, so I'd appreciate it if you'd do the math.
I'm encouraged by your comments and comments, even if you don't ask.
Maybe you use reddit, but not so many people use twitter.
If you're a Twitter user, please stand up!
And finally, thank you very much! The Sabre I made before, as expected, didn't get a lot of people and was soon frustrated, but thanks to you, this time it will continue without any frustration.
I'll be working on the wiki and the rules and everything to make it easier to use the sabre, so I'll be happy to help you!
It was not a snowstorm.
It's just cold rain.
If you keep making this prediction, the audience won't believe it either.
Is the city loaded?
Oh, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
I have only a limited knowledge of English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text is a level where I can feel a little bit of a difference in the text, but I can see what I want to say, and I can play without any obstacles.
I've seen this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel like a small company is translating well.
I wonder if it would take a long time for a non-native Japanese speaker to understand the nuances of Japanese.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level where the Japanese don't feel different, I think you should look elsewhere.
Is it cheaper to buy a shell at a 100 yen shop?

And I was living alone, about three kilometers away from my house, and I went to my friend and he said, "Well, why don't you live at my house?"
Do you agree?
And why it's not worth it to move closer to home.
I think that there are many reasons why people want to live alone, no matter where they are, and it's up to you to decide what you think.
When you visit the Fujiwara hot springs, what's the first thing you want to do?
After entering the hot springs, eating the stew while drinking the beer, and then drinking the local cuisine.
The battle is the practice of the blade of destruction.
"The equivalent of effort" is a human hymn.
The most unusual thing about "The Blade of Doom" in recent children's comics is that it "has a lot of practice".
It is believed that there are no battles in most cases, and that the practice of exercising in the morning or in the evening is not popular with readers.
It was the same one-shot comic book, "One Piece", where the one piece of hay was removed, but after two years of practice, I could only draw the rest of it and then jump off.
Well, the Wampi is one of the attractions of the eccentricity of the land that you walk through, although the practice of staying in one place is not always so compatible.
The practice of the main character of The Blade of Doom, Shōji Shichiro, began when he bowed down to the rescuer of his life, Yōko Kōji, and asked for the life of Yōko Kōji, who was trying to take his life. Yōki was told, "Don't give the right to kill and take life to others!"
The weak have no rights or choice, but to be forced to submit to the strong.
The gentleness of the volunteer (who is also a commando who does not explain his intention) is introduced by the "trainer" 滝左近次, who trains aspirants to enlist in the Ghost Slaying Squad.
The first contact between Anjiiro and Yūshiki is when he is asked, "What do you do when your sister eats people?" and he shoots his hand at Anjiiro, who is full of answers, saying "slow judgment".
The fans are talking about the plot and seemingly endless interaction.
The possibility that a moment may come when such a judgment is called upon is that of carrying around a sister who has become a ghost.
It's called initiation into practice from the heart.
However, he took the still untrained amateur Dōji to the narrow misty mountain and told him to come down to the mountain's peak before dawn.
The mountains are thin with air and full of traps and booby traps, and they die before they can enter the monastery.
Yet, with his acute sense of smell, he can smell the slightest scent of a cock that has been made by a human hand, and is hardly able to avoid it.
But the fact that he said, "I'm not suddenly so physically fit that I can avoid it all", is the essence of the ghost-destroying spirit.
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any support, they only awaken to use the "strength and skill that they have honed so far" to their original potential.
The "effort-for-effort" is a human hymn, as opposed to a ghost with unfounded supernatural powers, and a consistent and difficult rule in the book.
This, old one?
Not yet a bed, but a mat in front of the house, a mat on the bed, a blanket on the bed.
It's not an apartment.
I'm doing the same thing.
If you use a large room, it is better to sleep with a sheet than a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Is that a little bit of a stretch?
Who is the person who works part-time, full-time, or who works part-time with other shops?
No, I don't think that's what it is.
In that case, I don't think it's a "fuck"
I think it's "unfortunate" to devise something more, with the minimum of effort, to get more than the maximum of effort.
Is there anyone who is currently working on a national smoking ban?

Samsung Electronics has announced the launch of its new DX division, which integrates home and mobile devices.
Samsung Electronics announced on 12 December that it would be renamed DX (Device eXperience) after merging the CE and IM divisions into a set division.
The company's goal is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics announced that it has merged its CE and IM divisions to form the new DX division, which will be comprised of its VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Networks divisions.
A Samsung Electronics representative explained that "the name change reflects the medium-term business structure, future orientation and strengthening of global leadership".
The company also emphasized that its products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones, and communications devices, of course, are intended to allow consumers to easily enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs.
The name also reflected the strategy of creating a basis for differentiated products and services and creating synergy effects across the company's borders and differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to make content and services available to users through the "Multi Device Experience" Council, allowing them to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
So, what do you mean by that?
How do you say that in Japanese?
It's about 1500 BC.
BC stands for Before Christ, but in recent years, the term BCE has become more commonly used, based on the idea that Christians should be concerned about non-Christians.
BCE stands for Before the Common Era.

This is the Empire of the Undergrowth, right?
I've also helped with kickstarter and I've been translating it into Japanese.
There are some preference issues, but I don't think "desu/masu style" is appropriate for a science documentary where a man with a low voice is the narrator.
I'd like to see it in a more robust and stronger form.
They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
The larvae of the moth lurk in the sand to catch prey at any time, and only their disc-shaped heads are visible.
This is a little unnatural.
The larvae of the hammerhead lurk in the sand to catch their prey at any time, leaving only their disc-shaped heads to peer out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What's the matter?
* Did you refer to any other documentaries?
* From the ant's point of view
What is it?
And if you translate "armoured heads" to "disc-shaped heads", you're going to lose the part where it says "armoured heads on an ant scale".
24 collision in Aotake, the trailer driver was not sick and was not paying attention to the traffic.
In the accident of 24 cars collided in the city of Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer arrested and deported was not sick, and it was found that he had caused the accident due to some negligence.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in the city of Pyeongchang, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested and detained the first suspect, named as Muramaru Wange (54), who was driving a trailer and injured a 71-year-old man.
The suspect's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
But according to the investigators, the suspect is not sick, and some negligence is the cause.
Police are searching the homes of the suspects and investigating the situation.

After Mr. Helper came home, he went undercover.
The first book in the series is The Last of Us, which is a prequel to the original series.
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began with three volumes, ends with four!
Unlike the previous volumes, which focused on only one battle, which was drawn from the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this one is full of new tricks!
● The Superhero Pro-Reds has already started before the game!
These four volumes are, in a word, a very polite description of the final match between the meatball man and Robin Mask, but I want to emphasize that this is not a book that describes only the ring match.
And it's not like we're going to be playing a game that's going to be boring, because we're going to be playing a game that's going to be boring.
This feeling of tension in the work, which gradually increases with the beginning of the century's war, is certainly linked to the heightened tension of the readers, and it is astonishing that this period is really a calculated performance.
And, just before the big final, the third place match between Terriman and Lumenman is not to be missed.
And while I love the opulentness of the fight card, I love the backstage before the game when the Ramenman says to the meatman poster, "I'm the one who's going to get it!"
And he's trying to knock him out.
But the scene where Terriman, who happened to pass by, stopped and received the knife, and silently stared at it, and the scene was simply parted.
What's great about this is that both of them have already lost and they're not going to have a chance to fight the meat man in this tournament.
But there's a lot of excitement about the meat loaf.
And if you see something like this, you can't help but wonder about the future!
This is what it means to stand out, and it's a scene that still bothers me as a cartoonist!
The two fights end without much of a break, but the famous scene is the crying of Rammemann after the match.
"Don't rely on the luck of the gods!"
And I'm going to tell you something about this.
This is a great metaphor for the work itself, and I think the reader has always been fascinated by the fact that Kinman is the hero, and that he is the unassailable hero, and that he is the unconquerable hero.
But by letting Rahmanman make this comment, Mr. Yu Tomoka has already made it clear that he will no longer use his hand.
And the reader says, "Well, then, does the Kinman really defeat Robin with his own strength?
How could you?
And then you can imagine the unseen unfolding of the story, and then you can see it from another writer's perspective, and this is the same line that the teacher who is making the work has put on himself.
This is a great thing to do.
I think that's definitely one of the big points of this book.

The winter illumination weekend was held in the city of Hokkaido, Fukui Prefecture.
The first winter illumination begins in the green mountain herbal village of Sakamoto, in the middle of the mountain, and the garden is surrounded by gentle light.
The winter illumination, which began on November 26, is accompanied by 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along the 20-meter tall pine trees, hiking trails and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I've been to Fukui for a long time, and I was surprised to find a place like this".
"I'm so happy to see you, you're so beautiful, you're so relaxed".
Illumination is the first project to allow people to feel healing while avoiding secrecy. It is lit from 5 to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25.
Also on the final day, the 25th, there will be a button pot behavior and movie screening as a Christmas event.
I don't think many people can read the documents in order.
I had a friend who could read and write, and he was a good reader, but he was a bit of a Linux nerd, so I was just going through the basics and reading the book and looking for something interesting.

It's hard to understand everything without going through it.
I wish I could understand.

The newspaper is distributed online by the Agricultural Promotion Association and the Mizawa-based media group.
The Agricultural Promotion Council of the Yiwu, which consists of the towns and cities of Yiwu and JA, launched a PR campaign for agricultural products using "live commerce" to sell goods while distributing video on the Internet.
The first "UN MINATO (MENSEI) MARKET TV" organized by Tokyo Harbour District, the beloved warriors of love who were left on the market TV, appeared remotely and conveyed the charm of the area with special products.
The initiative "Oudohara × Shōsen no Open Port Project" was launched by the joint initiative of the Shibuya region and the port district. The show was broadcast from the Riyashū Vision House in the new town of Nanchang, Miyazawa.
Kurata Sanjaya, who acts as "Ri-san Somure", introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature with the "nitorito" (??) "stall of the Misakawa weaving brand.
He also reported on the cooking party with the martial arts of love.
In Tokyo, the studio is filled with the likes of Emiko Kawamura, a comedian, and more than 300,000 registered YouTubers who have tasted the local wine, wine, rice, beef, chicken, and princess.

I had a bad accident this morning.
I'm not getting the power for my NASPC.
- What happened?
First, open the windows in the morning for air.
The computer is on line.
2.) When I go back to my room after a while, I notice that my computer is sounding like a pink rotor, but it suddenly shuts down.
At this point, I thought that the fan was just getting worse due to the room temperature drop (~6°C).
So I decided to try again after I warmed the room.
3. Do not start.
The lamp and fan will move for a moment when the power button is pressed, but it will stop immediately.
I'm not saying anything after that.
I'll pull the plug and try again, but it'll only take a second.
4.) Connect only the motherboard to the ATX 20 pin or 4 pin and remove the other parts to try and not start.
5.) Since the past, PSU fans have been making the sound of "bubbbbbbbbbbb" as if they were hitting something, so I suspect that PSU is the cause.
I'll find the ATX power supply and try it later.
I guess.
If not, what can I do?
You can change the case with the mother.

I think that graphic design is an essential communication tool for our modern society.
And now, we're seeing a lot of people who are able to do this in their messages, their apps, their chat tools, and their pictures, not their stamps.

Maybe it's a good idea to sell it before it's profitable.
The name of the game is "Cheetah Presents".
They're not going to take it anywhere, and they're going to have a broken printer, a broken UPS, and so on.
I'm not a big-ass junkie, so I probably won't get paid, but somehow I'm getting it forwarded.
I collect coins as a hobby.
This coin is worth what?

I threw it away right after I graduated.
And I'm not going to go into the details of the room.

Hopefully, it's easy to handle, and it's always green, and it's always fruitful.
