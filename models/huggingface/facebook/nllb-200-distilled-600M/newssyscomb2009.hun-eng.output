Right-wing populists win in Austria, 29 percent overall
The significant weakening of the two parties in the so-called Grand Coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have led to the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously weakened, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8% of the vote, but lost 5.5% of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The PPP has gone even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and the result is literally disastrous for the People's Party, which is leading to early elections.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to public opinion polls.
But the voters were clearly punished for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation has been raised about the possible resignation of the current Vice Chancellor and Chairman of the Party, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could be done at the extraordinary meeting of the presidency on Monday.
This development is likely to facilitate the electoral outcome of the increasingly likely outcome, namely the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) which previously won 18% of the vote and the BZÖ 11%, however, the Social Democrats have also voiced their fears about a repeat of 1999 when the People's Party agreed to a joint government with the populists (which was unified at the time of the FPÖ, and left the BZÖ in 2005), which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared his willingness to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna for national politics, is obviously looking for this solution.
The Green Party still entered parliament, but it lost some of its popularity and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four percent threshold and failed to enter parliament.
India's relations may be cooling
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegal insect harvesting is not solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made this announcement after meeting with his Indian partner Pranab Mukherjee in New York today.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, there will be some cooling down", he said after the meeting, which was held under Czech incentives.
Mukherji said after the trial that the executive branch can find it difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, it mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local administration of Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved", the minister said.
However, Mukherji said that he would be better off appealing to the Supreme Court.
Then he could apply for bail and wait for his sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in a similar way during the trial.
"He has offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to release him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide "competent legal support" to the convict, the Indian minister mentioned.
But he also said that the Indian side had already provided such assistance.
"Our main interest is to preserve the best relations with India with a long tradition.
The Indians recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as it told ČTK, it stressed to its partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and charge these Czech scientists", he said.
Asked whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister omitted the answer.
"I've already received a fair amount of promises", he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
It goes down to the wall's electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But you're not interested in the continent, you're interested in a missing point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and its neighbouring seabed.
The territory is as big as the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division of Ocean and Maritime Affairs' 30-member task force.
Its head, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the head of the division, is attentive to the explanation, which he sometimes supplements.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed contains a world rich in natural resources that has been little known to the world.
It may contain petroleum, ore, and other minerals, but it may also contain unknown living organisms, which may be key to developing cancer drugs, for example.
Sea beds larger than land
Coastal states are now actively seeking new undersea areas.
They are enforceable by the United Nations Convention, which was agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
The main area of the so-called continental shelf is often a few hundred miles off the coast of a country.
Such a country has the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of continental demand.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and the bottom layer, which is the natural continuation of the undersea continental shelf.
The coastal sea borders are often extended by 200 nautical miles beyond the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted to the Commission for the External Borders of the Continental Shelf by the country concerned shall be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of years of preparation.
"Our task is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far considered five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful", Mikulka adds.
Australia has recently made a world-wide impression, first of all, by significantly expanding its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed assessed by the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
They hope that the profits from future use of the seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries are continuously submitting applications.
They shall do so within 10 years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area declared a "common heritage of mankind" by the convention begins.
No country has an exclusive right here.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike", says Director Mikulka, adding that "its territories are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually fixed".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern bloc is shared with other countries under the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
Under the Convention, this organisation was granted 'pioneering investor' status in 1991, like investors from some other countries.
Licensed to produce in the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is frozen there, it's a sort of undersea copy of the Tatra.
"This total area can be up to 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich mine for polymetallic minerals containing nickel, ore, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Another concrete example is provided by Rober Sandev, a fellow employee of the Macedonian Division.
A potato, or a little fantasy, reminds me of a parchment filled with magic words that bring the Dome to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage liberation.
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
More details are coming to light about the release of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the employees of the GSG 9, the FPS Aviation Department, the Federal Criminal Service and the logistics experts of the German Technical Service were also at the scene of the liberation.
Ministry spokesmen said Monday night that German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages were allowed to escape their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs of forced hostage-taking.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to incorporate it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists, five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts, on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, hostages were dragged back and forth across the border of Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclear so far, as have details of the hostage release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier has informed us that the hostages released are under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't give details of his release.
Berlin has so far provided no information on when they will return to Germany.
According to Bild, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on a German Air Force Airbus.
The U.S. House of Representatives is rejecting the rescue package.
The U.S. House of Representatives has defeated a proposed $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones is down.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets by a vote of 227 to 206.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program did not win a majority to curb the chaos that prevailed in the financial markets.
Supporters desperately tried to convince critics in a dramatic campaign of the need for the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, a Democratic negotiator, has called on the House to back the plan, even though it's still unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
The Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points in the voting.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote was over, then fell again after the failure was made public.
Experts are forecasting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The directors are registering more and more bookings.
Good winter for German travel agents.
According to one study, bookings for the coming months were up significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the study showed that the German travel will remain steady.
Travel agencies have seen a 31% increase in traffic for winter bookings compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of autumn bookings is already higher.
The number of travel agencies in October exceeded by 11% in October 2007, DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked until the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate has led to a particularly high demand for travel to the United States, the DRV said.
Here, the booking rate has increased by a third on the roads.
The German people also enjoyed the destinations of Spain, Turkey, and Greece, as well as their home countryside.
"The most wanted are organized roads", said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
The Commission therefore considers that the costs of transport on the roads are not necessarily comparable to those of the Member States.
Passengers can save money with, among other things, pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The summer months were also very good with bookings, so traffic growth is expected to increase again compared to the previous year - although another study showed that fewer German tourists were traveling compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Celebrities who have been playing ballerinas, drinking beer for a litre and wearing designer dirt.
It's the Wiesen debut.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, TV host, and wears a custom-made tunic.
I'm a black student, and I bought my clothes at the grocery store.
But one thing that connects us is that we've been in Wiesnen for three minutes, and the photographers are already cheating on us and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and this is my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirtball is doing its job.
As a northern Wiesn tourist from a white sausage-trained equator, my sense of comfort still limits the way people behave.
But when you get to Theresienwiese, it's not so bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears a pair of dirt pants or leather pants; no one looks irritable or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only come from my dirtbag.
A woman in Munich points to my mistaken tie: "You are free tied to the left, a virgin in the middle, a widow tied to the right".
I've secretly tied the machine from the back to the left.
"That's all right", he says, laughing.
Others make less noise about their subtle flirting techniques, wear simple fillet-bags with the words "I'm too drunk to dress", and unwittingly point their bare backs.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, stretching the "aaaaa" out.
All this after he tells me that he's got rid of the contents of his previously drunk cup.
Right next to one of the fire traps that everyone thinks is garbage.
So Bob is one of the notorious "forbidden swimmers".
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8:00 p.m., paramedics are parading the scene and taking care of the poor couple.
Patients always appear in groups - four of them carrying a covered litter from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: empty arrival, empty departure, stuffed to the brim.
You can't tell who's lying in the liquor compartment under the sink.
"These are the ones who are fully prepared", one of the paramedics shouted at me for my question, then on the set.
Police have named the victim.
Police have named the 63-year-old woman who was struck by a vehicle in Essex County and died in hospital.
The accident with a Brentwood resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, occurred on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving following the accident.
He's been released on bail ever since.
The expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were burning with a desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish backdrop.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with one tower at each front corner, and looks like some kind of German country townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little mad.
However, the interior of the department store was a sign of the scale of the business.
The station was opened by the German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation, in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, wanted to achieve its ambitions to occupy the Middle East by using this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to what is now Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroad lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, a machine gun train exploded and destroyed the beautifully designed roof of the building.
Turkish sources say there was a sabotage.
It has since slowly fallen into disrepair and has gone well beyond history.
However, today, as a railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, Turkey serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon, at least in a symbolic sense.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took a night train to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, after about 10:30 a.m. of darkness, which set the tone for the then famous documentary about the Old World, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, the new city intended to be a symbol of the new secular state that turned its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which has well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose -- located in a developing suburb, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order", he said.
From the backdrop of Turkey's isolation.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
She couldn't choose between the two.
It had to be opened in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to make a choice?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to be left out of the way".
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here almost automatically repeated: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East but also with the countries surrounding the Caucasus and the Black Sea are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey is to itself.
It's like they want to convey the message that, in a literal sense, all of Europe, along with Turkey, can get to Asia and the Middle East on those eastbound railways.
When I was at Hydarpasha station again, after another, mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who 100 years ago watched the reconstruction of this ornate building.
How surprised they would be to learn that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited for the ferry to take me back through the Bosporus at the port, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least back then, there was no question of which continent would claim this exciting land.
The memorable journeys of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: "As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) has conducted the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
They were originally only allowed to be under 21, but when Proteus performed the 1979 finale - many of us in our late 20's - we simply refused to get rid of the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any quartet they put before it - be it a madrigal or a Messiah piece; unaccompanied or accompanied by a great orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and we were grateful to the man who inspired us to keep our passion for music constant over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He always said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the box.
So sing it".
Karmester's technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
No matter what his musical level, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there ever was a leader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he spent conducting the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've written reviews of over 100 concerts in the last 40 years, but I've never disappointed with any of them, and I've often been excited by them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those who, in his words, simply "walked the world with a pair of well-known fighters".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25), "he continued his studies in economics at Oxford in 1946 and in 1950 became a fellow of the Houblon-Norman Institute... while continually preparing for his undergraduate degree, master's degree and PhD".
This is from Woodruff's writings on Beyond Nab End, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry under the direction of Professor J. D. Chambers, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he did spend time in the United States on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952, he attended the universities of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently and moved to Illinois.
You never know why Woodruff has been making this a period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Wise Man
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition Flamenco and Life because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
The simplicity and power that flowed from them, and the respect for the people in the photographs, caught my attention.
This exhibition is emotionally charged.
Resino is a master at heralding magical moments".
Second-time sales record for Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of Jazz.
True, its predecessor had a large passenger compartment, but the interior design of the new model is even larger.
All of this is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and fuel-saving.
Evolution versus revolution is what it is.
This is what the second-generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz scene is very similar to its predecessor, there have been many internal changes to it.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we go into the details of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz came about six years after the first generation was launched.
So first of all, we can say that Honda was able to renew this model in less time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less well known in Europe, it sets sales records in other markets.
Such a market is Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and again this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million copies of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda would like to increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
In 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz cars, and by 2009, it is estimated that 100,000 cars will be sold, resulting in a 17% increase in the European market.
Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total Spanish sales.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary's managers calculate 2000 copies sold in one year's time.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda's Spanish sales.
The company predicts 22,000 copies will be sold by the end of this year, down 4,000 from 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite the terms of the sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1,8% from 1,6% last year.
By 2010, I would like to increase that to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
It would be Insight, a compact, five-door, 4370 mm long hybrid, with a Japanese company selling 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, the United States would account for 50% of Insight's market share, while the remaining share would be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled to take place in the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more broad in every way.
It has a length of 3900 mm (five inches longer), a width of 1690 mm (two inches wider) and an axis length of five inches, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height, however, remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
The size of the passenger compartment has also increased.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new bodywork and the fuel tank in the middle, a solution we already know from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the total capacity of the so-called double-decker trunk has increased to 399 litres, or 19 litres, more than the first generation.
Although it is relevant that the above dimensions relate to the type with a 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
Some external modifications may also be detected, such as the rear low-beam headlamps or the optional panoramic glazing, and the rear seats are more accessible.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of production, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
The i-VTEC technology makes both models more efficient than the previous model, with lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine delivers superior performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre power output is 90 hp at 6000 rpm and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine -- which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz -- consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
A 100-horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The "Meat Car" Avoiding a Collision
To develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, precisely the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the behavior of bees to avoid accidents.
It could be a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C that's the first step in developing collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technology Center, in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University's Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this little robot in Japan.
The BR23C is a further extension of the Nissan four-seater safety-cover as defined by Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and R&D.
The robot will enhance the collision-avoidance capabilities of the company's products.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety coat.
But much more important is the bee's complex eye, which allows it to see at more than 300 degrees in all directions, and therefore the bee can fly uninterrupted in its own personal space.
To mimic the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a laser rangefinder.
The instrument shall identify obstacles, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which shall be immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation, within a distance of up to 2 metres from the BR23C at a distance of 180 degrees.
"Once the obstacle is detected, the little robot immediately changes direction by following the movements of the uterus, moving the wheels at smaller or larger angles to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the instruments currently available is that in this case the avoidance maneuver is completely automatic.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and project chief engineer.
Unlike the bees, the avoiding maneuver cannot be directed up or down, nor transverse, but can only move in two dimensions and only in the direction of the reversal of the wheels, i.e. not in infinite directions and ways, as in the case of bees.
That's why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions, in addition to acceleration and slowing down.
"This device only needs to process and respond to the data every few seconds.
It doesn't need data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it's not really a gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step towards developing an instantaneous collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates could be introduced into series production cars within 10 years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional possibility to help the car reach its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
Fear of the mortgage
We have to admit that the Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of cash to invest, is not short of sound judgment.
With the crisis looming and Americans avoiding getting sucked into the backs of questionable mortgage banks, they've created a fun and informative online game called Bad Credit Hotel.
This is the "Russian Credit Hotel" ... that is, the galleys.
The picture of the lodging and especially the reception hall suggests that we should consider once, twice, or even three times whether it is really time to take out a loan.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because that's probably the point of the matter.
The information on the website is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the general public.
But what if we added to the game?
For example, a hotel would be our dream room.
It's actually something, because we don't even dream of buying an apartment...
Morgan Stanley is opening up its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will be providing a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which is paying $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the price of Morgan Stanley shares plunged sharply in the stock market.
A week after the initial agreement was announced, the two banks said MUFG would acquire 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock for $25.25 per share, or $3 billion in total.
The accepted price remains more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which provide a 10% return on their shares and have a convertible exchange rate of $31,25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of $29 which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell 6.79% at around 5 p.m. local time in Greenwich, which closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company", explains John Mack, the group's CEO in the United States.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its operations while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires greater caution from Wall Street corporate giants.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago that the stake would be entirely of tribal shares", explained Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's Tokyo executive director.
'However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid any potential risks.'
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor guarantee scheme.
The transaction will result in a decrease in return per share of approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG can convert half of its preferred shares into shares in a year's time if the latter's trading price exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a given period, i.e. rises to about $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that it can use the funds from MUFG to exploit its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the group's spokesman did not wish to provide precise information on the two new Allied strategic plans.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet has improved "definitely" since late August.
The last few weeks have been a major test for the group as its share price has fallen by half while the cost of its default risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost was moderated on Monday but remained high, at around 12%.
The only other big investment bank left to survive after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced it had raised $15 billion, part of which comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Statement by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
Reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Corre of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa expressed his views on the new constitution on Sunday.
It succeeded in its mission, with 64% of voters voting yes to the referendum according to the official results, which were 80% of the votes cast.
That 28% of the population voted yes, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were rejected by voters.
The draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
Two polls at the polling stations on Sunday and a counting by a civil organization both showed a huge surge in yes votes of 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, was already talking about his constitutional bill winning on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won a decisive victory", he declared, thanking the Ecuadorians at his governor's residence in Guayaquil, about 300 miles (280 km) southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correia was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
The report by the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission said the vote was conducted in a calm atmosphere, with a 444-point text summarizing the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution places state power at the service of the economy, retaining the state's right to "planning development" for a country that primarily relies on oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by migrants.
The Correa constitution, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms and is entitled to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that he wants to take this opportunity and will run again for the presidency in February 2009.
The constitution also includes free health care and education, and the president has already begun implementing it in a country of 13.9 million people and half of the population living below the poverty line.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits foreign troops from entering the country, which could end the Quito-Washington agreement to use the Ecuadorian facility as the base for U.S. drug control.
The 19 hostages in Chad were freed
Egyptian commander has been targeting kidnappers who have been hostage to 11 tourists and their eight companions for 10 days.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held for 10 days in the desert, from where they were transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, unharmed.
The hostages were freed in Chad by an Egyptian commander during the morning fire.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at al-Maza military base at around 4:30 in the afternoon, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Ma'adi, a suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers "have not been paid a ransom", said Egypt's tourism minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were taken captive on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in a field trip safari, and the group was then dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostages.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organises safaris.
According to an Egyptian security official, a 30-man special command arrived on two helicopters at the scene of the hostage-taking raid just before dawn.
"Firefighting broke out between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled", the official said.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were joined by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomatic leader, Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and Italian special operations groups.
"We must recognize that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and action groups", he said, without giving further details.
He also denied that the hostages had been ransomed.
The Sudanese military had earlier announced that they had arrested a vehicle on which the hijackers were traveling during patrol, killing six of them (including the cadet leader) and arresting two.
The army claimed that the hostages were linked to a Darfur rebel organisation, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organisation immediately denied.
Lettres - The Silent Majority of Culture
The news and the ongoing election campaign are currently focusing on the debate over cultural funding.
We can only be happy about that.
But a part of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will raise their voice to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money spent on starving small museums, archaeological sites and national historic sites?
What politician dares remind the federal government that they don't care about its monuments and cultural heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that actually ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on restoring Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
And the constitution of our American neighbors says that protecting cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by every citizen, every elected representative, and every governmental body in concert.
More than 40 000 volunteers from 211 societies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archaeology and genealogy are working within the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec to research history and to preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological finds on a minimum budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth and their last breath of water as real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis Bank is nationalised by the Benelux governments
Partial nationalization is assisted by the Benelux countries, as the first European to be hit by the US credit crisis, Fortison, a Belgian-Dutch bank in difficulty, is providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support to a financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments reached the highest level of agreement on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the Bank's case can therefore be considered to be of a kind that is of a precedent.
The decision on Sunday night said that nearly half (49 percent) of the three states would buy the bank's existing assets.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interests, including, in particular, the activities it purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year, mainly insurance.
Fortis' stock began to plummet last week, and by the second half of the week, the institution was experiencing a major recession.
However, analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow itself to go bankrupt.
His company's stock plunged to a 14-year low of about 12 percent on Friday.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the group's total market capitalisation is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's managers this is unrealistic.
The management of the company, by the way, blamed the overseas market uncertainty surrounding the adoption of the $700 billion package for the collapse of Fortis shares.
By Monday, the paperwork was up a little.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to the bank by Filip Dierckx.
The financial institution was looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a substantial offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors should not be alarmed, they should not lose their money.
There's been no panic among the bank's clients, no bank account raids.
Fortis has independent branches in Hungary and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the Chicken
In the United States, life and health insurers often refuse to take out insurance contracts with applicants based on the information they have about people buying medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which binds the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned in any case.
It must be in independent hands, or the fox will be the chicken", says Richard Dicket, a program developer who tracks prescriptions for drugs.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance premium and the accident insurance premium dependent on the health status of the applicant and shall not insure the risk if they consider it too high.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination and the contract was only concluded with the knowledge of the results.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: Using a customer ID, he can easily obtain from pharmacies what medicines he's bought in the last year and a half, and the program itself can infer what disease he's suffering from and what his medical condition is.
For example, if you take a regular high dose of a cholesterol lowerer, it indicates that you have practically untreatable high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some of which also set a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do outside the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, such as certain compounds can be used to treat migraines or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, while the former is not.
Separate companies have been set up to collect and process the data, and they ask for the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
Now they are being compelled to do so by the authorities, although no punishment has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies have recently been processing laboratory results and linking them to drug use data to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There's a separate health data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurers.
Congress is currently considering legislation that would give authorities control over data-processing firms.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his program, which would involve the express consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So chickens are, in a way, a reference to fox's goodwill.
The global Marseille menu
The EU and India are doubling trade
As the EU and India are mutually leading trading partners, this topic was also the agenda for the ninth summit, alongside other, largely global issues.
Today, there will be a summit between France and India, focusing on nuclear cooperation.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic superpower that should have a greater say in international affairs, the Member States have not yet reached a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the next President of the European Union and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Szingh, with whom they agreed to double trade to 100 billion euros in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this respect, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, meaning that air traffic can also be flown in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism were condemned in all forms by both sides and the UN Conference was urged to be convened.
They also pushed for the end of the Doha trade cycle, although both sides have a large share in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it is committed to its energy and climate programme, meaning that it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the future climate conference, to a global deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent food prices from rising and supported an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is heading to the French capital today to negotiate a peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris is hoping to get French companies a 20 billion euro contract to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement is for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are strongly represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, covering a total area of 171,790 square meters, with more than 403,000 books on display.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. Italy will occupy 264 square metres of exhibition space by setting up a single Italia Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, which will also provide an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the Italian publishing market is continuously declining in the proportion of foreign authors, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane that disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found at an elevation of 3,000 feet [3,000 m] near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the California-Nevada border.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
"After establishing the flight status, we have sent a team and now we can be sure that it was the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared", Sheriff John Anderson of Madera County said at a news conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that hours after the wreckage was discovered, an investigation team was called in to identify the plane and determine whether it was indeed a Bellanca 8cab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Also yesterday in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two identification cards for Fosset issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was turned down a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has built up a number of peaks that have made him a legend.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he successfully orbited the earth for the first time with an airship: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes at 15,445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking commercials
An unusual yet original and distinctly shaped hobbyist aircraft with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a nutshell, that's the latest compact Mercedes-Benz SUV that the German automaker has tried to bring to market.
This is why the launch campaign for the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the new vehicle is carried out by a previously unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The three-stage campaign will dominate Milan's central shopping street, the Corso Comot, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of media communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a spatial format, where the new SUV will be visible in almost real size and three-dimensional form using special glasses distributed around the Corso Como.
The viewer will feel as if the car is rising from the poster.
Then, with the innovative technology Elumina8, every detail of the new GLK is visible to be assembled into a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the advertising world of stereotypes in the automotive industry with this promotion.
Will this get the interest of prospective buyers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Triveneto youths, they're probably banned from the track.
But who are these 150 to 200 boys and girls that all of Italy is ashamed of now?
They never collided with the opponent's crushers.
The core of the group is on the right.
The organizers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udinese.
These were joined by smaller groups (in fact only a few units) from Campania and Puglia in Sofia.
Italian flags were flown with the birthplace of the surfers on them, which were removed on Saturday to prevent identification.
They're following the example of the English cricketers.
In Bulgaria, they were facing a real Nazi squad of surfers, the Levski Druckers.
The Italian Football Association has issued 144 tickets to Italian football players, which were titled, making it easier to control the football team.
The Ministry of Interior checked everyone: there was no one among those preparing to go to Sofia who was undergoing proceedings, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian football players with football-related prize money have been denied tickets and travel.
The Ministry of Interior is currently waiting for minutes from the Sofia Police, and then it will take the necessary measures: those who are arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for five years.
This is an international ban on visiting all Italian stadiums and all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet on any football field.
Thank you.
But we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, or that others will join the few hundred and fifty.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and those who behave like this must not be excused", the Interior Ministry said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially as Wednesday's match day draws near in Lecce.
Puglia has a small cell that supports the Italian ultrasound.
The Security Review Committee, which can be counted on as a department of the Homeland Security Service, will be meeting on Tuesday.
"Does the scandal of Duce-Duce and the flying arm under the Italian anthem not constitute a crime in Bulgaria"...
This idea was developed, unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the Ministry of the Interior's surveillance service (the post was held by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italia group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, it's not illegal to feed the Ducet in Bulgaria, but even that made the 150-200 of those crushers behave shamefully.
I'm not a sociologist, added the first person in the surveillance service, but crimes must be prosecuted in the country where the crime was committed.
So far, this group has not caused any problems, so we need to look at what exactly happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's talk a little bit about the Italian anthem being blown up: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it's not a well-being... "
