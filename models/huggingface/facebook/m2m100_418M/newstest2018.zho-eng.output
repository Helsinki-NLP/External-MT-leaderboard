Civil rights groups send travel warnings to Missouri
Due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Colour Population Promotion Association (NAACP) has issued a travel warning to colour populations preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP’s Missouri Travel Consultancy, which came into force on 28 August 2017, calls for a series of suspicious ethnic events in recent years in Missouri that all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri citizens should be attentive and very cautious when traveling to Missouri,” the group said in a statement.
NAACP notes that a recent adoption of the Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination laws, and the state's law enforcement is also to a certain extent targeted to minorities, the phenomena that led the organization to publish travel warnings.
Violations of citizens' rights are happening on people.
They were asked for the color of the parking lot, were hit or killed,” said NAACP President Rod Chapel, Missouri, to The Kansas City Star.
“We received a lot of complaints, unprecedented numbers.
This is the first such warning to be issued by the organization in the United States against a state.
The organization quotes the Missouri University’s raciality of black students and the death of 28-year-old black man Tolly Sanders in Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances: he was consuming fuel while traveling to Missouri and was arrested by the Missouri police without any accusation of crime.
In the consultation it also stated that a recent report from the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office shows that "white drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be checked on the parking lot than white drivers."
Chapel said: “The advice is to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri.”
“People need to be prepared, whether they take the guarantee to Missouri or let their relatives know they’re traveling within the state.”
According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 Hate Crimes in 2015; according to the number of crimes, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination companies.
Previously, the U.S. states adopted immigration law enforcement laws, requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest immigrants, the U.S. Civil Liberties Alliance (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial proceedings, and published travel advice against Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government to other countries, but recently, consulting groups have taken this way to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
After the “Golden Age” in 2015 which has grown sharply, the overall film market in 2016 has entered a period of calmness, whether it could break over the total billing house outcomes of 440.69 billion yuan last year has become a question.
According to the data published by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, the prices of new houses and second-hand houses in Beijing doubled, with an increase of 0.6% and 1.1%.

The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: make the old people feel “live in a new era”
Beijing may have three thousand years of history, but it is also rapidly transformed into today’s modern charming city.
The capital of China has an incredibly high speed of internet, advanced technologies such as face-to-face recognition software, has a huge investment in artificial intelligence and has unparalleled internationalized energy, it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners with an exploration spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company’s website on January 16, German citizen Clemens Seth said: “If I could succeed there, I could succeed anywhere in the future, he cited the singer Frank Sinatra singing the New York City.
Seth, who was the creative director of the Journalist Archive magazine, said: “If Sinatra lived to this day, he’d probably sing a city like Beijing and he said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new era” and always following the trend.
Simon Norton, who lives in England, but has recently lived in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog site 4Corners7Seas: “People generally have a sense of being in the center of some great thing, it’s hard to explain, but it’s for many foreigners to stay there for a long time.
The city’s high-speed internet quality and a technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Penya Fuelt, from Manila, who currently serves as Vice-CEO of the Beijing Children website, said: “Beijing is rapidly turning into a non-cash society, the Internet integrates the functionality of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing’s technology ambition, face recognition software has been very popular, and many mobile apps use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver.
Beijing has also recently announced its plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park, with more than 400 being built there, which will focus on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies from biodegraded to autonomous vehicles.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, participating in these celebrations is appreciated by foreigners, Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and one of the most easily participating festivals for foreigners.
“I advise to help Chinese friends prepare for the past year, cleanse the apartment and the red spring union with a new year blessing on the door of the house is equally important, on the day of the eve, all family members should gather together to eat a rich meal, then keep the year up to midnight, with a beautiful bright flame to celebrate the new year.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is numerous and is growing, but the Chinese language barriers and the facility of communication between foreigners are easily an excuse for them not to be fully integrated into the local culture.
“Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have almost no experience with their host country.If the initial attempt to contact Chinese is not successful, then you’ll easily have the feeling of being with other foreigners.
In these so-called “Old Outside Bubbles” (“Old Outside Bubbles” means foreigners only mixed among foreigners, without contact with local people and local culture – translator notes), foreigners gather in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little more ordinary – that’s easier than people might imagine.
Seth said: “The last one or two hours of Chinese private lessons or the entry-level broadcasts should be suitable for everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help in shopping, in a restaurant or in a taxi.
Continuous air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but government efforts in recent years have led to some problems.
The inhabitants emphasize the importance of outdoor activities in the heat months that are often less polluted, and to take those blue sunshine days as an opportunity to explore the historic Houston or the popular sunshine parks.
“Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things under the surface, you can find great art and music activities, pleasant nightlife, historical miracles, super-modern business areas and ancient humble districts.

In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phones to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers, otherwise it would not allow it to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this to harm the interests of consumers and to hinder competition.
The EU regulators originally asked Google to respond before July 27.
If an anti-monopoly accusation was established, Google would face a maximum fine of 10% of its global revenue, approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for preference to its own shopping services in search results.

A picture of understanding: Bitcoin's legal status throughout the world
In addition to the price rebounds naturally caused by speculative properties, this round of digital currency’s decline also has to do with “host enemies” – regulatory risks don’t have to do.
From the visual map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than the West, and the countries that represent the global subjects are still observing the legality of digital currencies, representing the "Black Swan Risk" remains large.
* This article is from Wallstreetcn (Microsoft ID:wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. for more interesting information, go to wallstreetcn.com, or download the Wallstreetcn app. *
With regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets like China, South Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency led by Bitcoin has been damaged since this week, the price of Bitcoin dropped over $10,000 on Tuesday, the highest single-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price rebounds naturally caused by speculative properties, this cycle of digital currency decline is also unrelated to the ever-hosted “enemy” – regulatory risks.
At this important point, the Visual Big Data site HowMuch.net has created a chart that shows Bitcoin’s legal status and the degree of regulation across the globe.
As shown below, green represents the legitimate market of Bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although not yet publicly legalized the status of Bitcoin, but there is no major limitation of use; light pink represents the limited markets, that is, the local government tries to methodise the use of digital currency through the red line policy or regulation; deep pink represents Bitcoin is defined as an illegal country; gray is a country that has not yet been reviewed.
(The image above is from the HowMuch.Net Visualization Team on January 15)
The article points out that from the picture of the distribution of the green blocks can be seen that the attitude of the Eastern countries to Bitcoin in traditional sense is more conservative than the West.
Russia is the largest country that currently defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet been criticized and has not yet adopted related policies.
North America and Western Europe are the region with the highest rate of acceptance of Bitcoin, which is the more concentrated distribution of green blocks.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly differentiated, and the distribution of color blocks in these regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have a certain degree of restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken about bitcoin.
Summary of the above data is known that in the world’s statistical 246 countries, a total of 99 countries (or 40%) have no restrictions on bitcoin trading and use, i.e. green and orange yellow areas.
There are seven countries (or 3 percent) that are limited to the market (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 percent) defining Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 percent) have no more deal with digital currency information (grey).
This shows that countries that make up global subjects (53%, more than half) are still looking forward to the legality of the digital currencies led by Bitcoin within the territory, and also represents the "Black Swan Risk" of Bitcoin remains high as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict the digital currencies.
The article suggests that global regulators do not fully understand this emerging category of digital currencies, and may be the main reason for most countries not to make any expression yet.
Although the “popularity” of Bitcoin has grown on index since last year, it doesn’t mean that all countries are interested, some countries may be worried that local currencies are threatened, or more worried that digital currencies are being used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China’s beginning to fight out-of-the-field exchanges’ online platforms and mobile apps, South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchanges, the EU believes Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “threatening the bloodstream” and so on.
The chief executive of The Wall Street News, “Read to hear the 2018: World Central Mother’s Opening of Digital Currency Year?” has mentioned that from a perspective of regulation, acceptance/criticism and adoption, 2018 will be the digital currency Year of the World Central Bank.
The practice of major states like Russia to criticize the status of Bitcoin’s legality is also for the official issue of digital currencies.
Xinhua Agency Madrid on January 8 (Reporters She Yoshi) Barcelona's new assistant Cutinio appeared for the first time in Nocamp on January 8.
Coutinho passed a medical examination in Barcelona that morning and signed a contract with Barcelona President Bartomeu that would expire in the summer of 2023.
He later appeared as a Barcelona player in front of almost 7,000 fans in Nocamp.
According to the Spanish media, the total transfer fee of Coutinho, or up to €1.6 million ($1.77.77 yuan), is the first price in the history of the Barcelona club and Western League.
As Cutinio is still injured, he needs a break of 20 days to attend his basketball show in the Barcelona shirt.

Trump's White House is targeting the Divine of Freedom
The most certain sign of regime change was when they began to attack the statue.
Thus, Saddam Hussein, in the Paradise Square of Baghdad in 2003, was thoroughly planned.
Stephen Miller, as one of the key minds of the Trump administration, is sure to know what’s going to happen when he discusses with Jim Acosta of the U.S. Cable Television News Network (CNN) on the presidential proposal for strict restrictions on legal immigration.
Fairly, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did that, then a group of shipping owners and liberal followers would surely put him out of life.
But he really attacked the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was painted on the base in 1903 (this monument was built 17 years later).
“I don’t want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Goddess of Freedom is the symbol of America’s freedom illuminating the world.
The poem you refer to, that was later added, not part of the original freedom goddess.
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it was not really about history.
This involves the modern sound of Lazarus' exhortation, the only country that seems to invite not only any elderly immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people desire freedom to breathe, / the suffering refuse your crowded beaches."
There is no “suffering people reject” at the moment that our screen becomes more brilliant.
Miller has not been engaged in literary commentary, and he clearly shows that these people are not welcomed in the United States of the time of Trump.
This conflict about the sculptural significance is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, who recorded her poems on the foundation after her death, were clear that the behavior in which they were involved was highly political.
The sculpture aims to express the connection between French and American Republicanism through an ancient classical comparison of the female dewi of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of the woman is no longer abstract, she is to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the kidnapping mother.
The poem is combined with this painting as a successful feminism coup and a devastating blow to American patriotism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing people always wanted to change it back to its original intention.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a Trump’s temporarily baptist, believed in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and he is now a early neoconservative, bringing the fire of America’s wisdom to the stupid world: “The Goddess of Freedom is courageous toward unprecedented.”
She intended to bring the flame of freedom from the United States to other places in the world.
The fire is not the light of the American road.
Unusually, Limbus is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
The very imaginative practice of Lazarus is to be able to see it.When a tired, poor but hopeful person will see it on the roof after a long and often terrible journey.
From a surface point of view, this involves the question of the perspective of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her sculptures communicate to them and require the hopes and welcoming intentions they hear.
Of course, this is not the point of view Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
They flame not to light the road, but to light the hatred of their only source of power.

2017 World Championship: Neil Black high praises Scotland's national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers that at the time the British national team had only two Scotts.
The Executive Director of the British Sports Association, Neil Blake, said the world championship team consisting of 16 strong Scotlanders will make a huge contribution to the "National Team".
The number of Scotland's athletes who were selected to participate in the 2017 London Tennis World Championship, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Blake believes “Scotland is getting an unusual development,” and British sportsmen must learn from it.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will persist until we succeed,” Blake said.
“I’m looking for people from the Scottish Sports Academy to talk, they think that’s related to their work.
Scottish sportsmen think that’s related to their performance.
The British Sports Association believes that this has to do with their work.
Even street people think that.
Whatever it is, it’s a superstorm.
Several Scotland sportsmen are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 meters higher than Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is chosen as the captain of the group.
“Eric is a bit humble.
Her Captain's speech was incredible," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they’re for Scotland or where they live or train, are proud to get out of the door and work hard enough to get out of the door.
The passion and genuine emotions that Erid naturally put in are good.
The British Federation Silver winner, who will participate in his fifth World Championship in the 400m cross-border race, said that there were 16 Scotts in the British national team, which was "incredible."
Previously, the number of Scotland athletes to participate in the World Cup was up to seven, which was the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
She has scored five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will participate in the 1500m and 5000m project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500m project competition, is another Scotland player, who has previously achieved good results in the season, winning in the UK national pre-election and Olympic anniversary, respectively.
Doyle remembers her to participate in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
Captain said she was proud that so many of her colleagues not only joined the team, but in some cases also challenged the medals and ran into the final.
"The special thing to be the captain of the national team is that it is voted by the other members of the national team. therefore, knowing your team members are voting for you to struggle for extraordinary achievements, anyway, it's a great honor for me," she added.
“Naturally, I’m very proud of all the Scotland teams.
This only shows how far we have gone.
And they are all here’s old card sportsmen, the sportsmen who are about to move forward to the goal of the awards.
How did my captain speak?
Well, I think it is great.
I just referred to the fact that in this case, we were very lucky because we held the world championship at home.
Therefore, it is really important that we grow with home support and with the return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will have a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere will be amazing.

Block the critics on Facebook: If you can’t tolerate the guilt of voters, don’t campaign for public functions
Our father knows the style of the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but shortly after, the major newspapers began to criticize him all, from domestic politics to political principles, and one of them was not overlooked.
He was angry about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not blame these critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech is deprived – we will be killed in silence and stupidity like a sheep.”
This reminded me of the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who had to study from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people’s posts as they posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberation Alliance has filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s officials thought the trial was very harsh and the online reports were filled with their strong opposition: “Who’s interested?”
Many people say, “This is just Facebook.”
But that is important.
This is especially important because it is faced with people like Hogan.
He was a Republican who served as Governor in a democratic majority state, and he was also surprisingly popular.
Of the country’s 50 governors, he was ranked second.
Hogan is not a reactive manicure.
He governs the state of Maryland and is strictly compliant with the rules.
He was also very good at putting Facebook as the main way to connect emotions with voters, dramatically showing his post-chemotherapy head for the first time on the homepage.
So blocking people who come to the Governor's home page comment is absolutely unnecessary, and in the end is very dangerous. this home page is a public forum, a official management platform for the list of employees paid by the public.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Shas defended the governor's behavior, saying she believed that blocking their comments was just to get them a bit undermined.
But they exaggeratedly describe it as a flooded beast or angry cynic.
The Washington Post talked face-to-face with the people blocked by Hogan.
They are just a dialogue of ordinary people with the leadership they choose: their identity is a teacher, a small business owner and a priest, not a flood beast.
They say their comments are deep, respectful and not downstream.
The priest cited the words of the Bible in his post, calling for Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
The senior lawyer of Boy, Maryland, Rakhimi Salma Ramani was not angry, but she asked questions about hatred crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post news story comment section, “I am kindly commenting and I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don’t like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people, considering them as what they call psychology, rather than considering them as a group of concerned citizens.
The “intensive waste information bombing” called by the governor’s officials may seem to be a “sustainable claim” for others.
The Facebook Age makes it easy to modify a message and it only takes to block a critic or to delete a negative comment.
Furthermore, cleansing is far cleaner than before, and in the past years, to do the same effect, it is necessary to send employees out to gather and burn newspapers with criticism or to arrest or shout protesters.
But that’s what’s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan was not the first public official to be accused of screaming others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being accused by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week a pivotal ruling came in Virginia, which was about such issues.
According to the U.S. District Judge James C. Catherine, the President of the Lawrence County Surveillance Committee, the behavior of blocking voters from her Facebook page violated the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Baven (R) is also seen by the U.S. Citizen Freedom Alliance because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the Washington era, affordable mail fees and the internet had a similar influence.
The number of newspapers doubled fourth between 1776 and 1800, and some writers anonymously criticized his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also targeted his anonymous flood beast.
People, using false names like Yurikla, Valerius, Beliser, and Pogas, write letters to the newspaper to criticize Washington’s decision.
According to the historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper’s online project, his office was overwhelmed by a petition and criticized his attitude to the United States-United States Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Agreement signed with Britain.
But he did not scream them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept this.
The winds of the building are all drawing people’s sensitive nerves.
Limited purchases are a hard leverage for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jiangsu issued a regulation that graduate students will continue to pay social insurance for six months, and will be able to enjoy the equal home purchase policy for local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that states that university students can be dismissed with a graduation and employment certificate within 3 years of their graduation.
Following the policy coded, the official said, "university students can buy houses at a price below the market price of 20%";
In July, Chengdu issued a regulation that foreign universities undergraduate and higher academic qualifications young people can apply for a graduation certificate.
Besides this, there are also cities or regions such as Kunshan, Shanghai and Chongqing have also launched the “talent introduction” policy, reducing the threshold for talent purchases.
Zhang Macrowey believes that this is actually the competition of the major cities for the population, especially the talent, keeping the population, especially the talent, the cities are competitive, this is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even believe that this means that the time for the “limit purchases” of the building to be cancelled has come.

The Director of the Environmental Surveillance Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Xi Jinping, presented in Beijing that in August, a total of 57 cases of continuous penalties were implemented on a daily basis across the country, and the new amendment to the Environmental Protection Act, implemented at the beginning of this year, clearly coded China’s environmental law enforcement efforts.
Currently, the Environmental Protection Authorities across China can use the means of punishment such as daily continuous punishment, closing detention, limit production stop and transfer administrative detention to detect environmental violations, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of detention and detention were implemented across China; 177 cases of limit production and stop production were implemented; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspicious environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Hunan implemented seven consecutive penalties on a daily basis, at the moment, China is embedded from end-to-end control to full-time, entirely strengthening environmental pollution management.
Although the pressure on economic decline appears, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously clearly stated that China should correctly deal with the environmental protection position in economic development, enhance the “green strength”, the faster the economic growth decline, the more it can not relax the environmental protection, and play the optimal role of environmental protection on the economy.

Badtina Dajer doesn’t have a oven when cooking.
She even rarely uses the pot.
Her wooden house, located in Enarotali, the capital of the province of Panye, Papua, Indonesia, the household woman usually just put a potato – the locals call it “nota” – directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burned potato was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands, and the wolf sinked and ate it.
Dajer was sitting on the soil – she didn’t have furniture, it was also the place where she was doing her everyday family work, such as washing clothes, washing clothes, and the water was very thin, all of which came from the nearby basin.
There is a bathroom in a room without a roof, that is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to the field to take care.
Multiple marriage phenomenon is common here.

Currently strongly demanded independence and the movement against the Dutch rule will soon redirect to the government of Jakarta, as the government exercises high-pressure rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and rights defenders.

Enarotali's location is distant and unthinkable; to get here you need to get 90 minutes by plane from the province of Chaapla to Nabaré, then rental a car for 5 hours, and the way through the stomach to the sea.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden houses are surrounded by a bamboo bar, and the curved iron roof roof is a variety of yellow brown coatings made of iron roof.
There are very few Indonesians who come to the country, not to mention the journalists, and there are almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian prophets, the Pago Mee believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are also other changes here.
“We don’t get to wear these clothes, and she’s about her bright handheld, dark shirt, and bright half-sweatshirt.
We used to cover our body with leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and the region with the highest and lowest infant death rate in Asia.
This is also the Venice of Indonesia.
The Panie County is located in the heights, with an area approximately the same as New Jersey, with a population of 153,000 people.The world's largest and most profitable gold mining Glasberg is only 60 miles away, the gold mining is owned by the Phoenix-based Philip McMorlan Copper Gold Company.
Only in 2015, Phillip exploded about $1.3 billion in gold and copper mines.
Furthermore, Papua’s wooden resources are very rich, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuians, and the powerful military force of Indonesia is therefore able to constantly suppress them.
According to a 2005 survey by the New York Times, Phillip paid $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for a single official.
The papaya demands for independence are increasingly strong, which threatens the Golden Lord, and they suffered cruel treatment.
More than 500,000 Papuians have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, the mass massacre in the 1970s in the Papua tribal Highlands has been upgraded to racial extermination.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
The 2016 report “We’ll Lose Everything” of the Catholic Bishop of Brisbane contains evidence of the previous year’s evil events, such as out-of-law execution, torture – another report that calls rape and telecommunications especially common – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Andrias Halsono, an Indonesian human rights observatory researcher, said that “violence is happening every day, so it’s hard to count the number of victims.”
Papua’s resources brought a large number of immigrants outside Indonesia, and the repression began.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the population structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated Java Island, Kalimandan Island, Summit and Sulawesi Island.
Java's food stores sell chicken and vegetables mixed with gado gado, served as flower sauce.
Local people are struggling.
The 24-year-old Panyai local Apus Yu moved to the province of Chaapra to find a job, explaining that “those immigrants began to sell chicken and vegetables at the traditional markets at a lower price than the local Papuians.
This caused the local papua – the papua woman (mama) – to lose their markets.
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo (sometimes referred to as Zokovi) has sworn in his 2014 campaign to address the issue of inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The road to the presidential house of Jakarta was supported by 27 regions of all 29 regions, including Panai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel being betrayed.
“We’ve broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zokov, hoping that he can fulfill our wishes and restore justice.”
In fact, only two months after Zokovi took office in October, Panye had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas praise before the fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly riding on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them to open the car lights.
According to the local priest Awat Tebi, one of the soldiers was unhappy with their voice and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that the drunk soldiers were shooting the children with their weapons.
Then one of the soldiers shot the group of children.
The 16-year-old Julianus Yemene was seriously hit and in coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency election committee building burned a bear fire and the event upgraded the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They took the ceremonial hunt and jumped on the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe – running around and imitating the bird sound.
Some protesters began to throw stones on the military regularly.
According to a official document record seen by Time magazine, when the emotions continued to intensify, the soldiers received an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resist more than three times, immediately shoot, but the document was not published to the local media."
The 56-year-old Jeremias Kaamu, who is the leader of the Enarotali Kego Koto Street, feels that there is a danger to happen, so calls on the crowd to be calm and asks them to go home.
But no one was enthusiastic to hear him.
He stood on the door of his colorful wooden house and told the Time magazine, “When I came back, my left arm suddenly shot.
Kaamou is still unknown who shot, but he says the bullets came from the gathered soldiers.
He said, “There was a lot of shooting, and there was a lot of shooting.
According to the cousin of the local Olpheus Yule, he witnessed the shooting and saw Olpheus Yule three shots in his body.
Yohanes, sadly, told the Time magazine, “I ran and checked his body to see if he was, or not.
I found him dead... I kissed him...
Papua Police Governor Eugene Mende told reporters that his subjects were just "protected" by the police station as the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papua police spokesman and police chief Pugio Sullistio said, “When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is a matter of life.
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The news about the murder was slowly spread next day in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi made a loud speech in Chaapra, expressing his deep sympathy to the families of the victims, and sworn to solve the problem of abuse of power in the history of Papua.
He said, “I hope this issue can be resolved as soon as possible, so that it will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Security Minister Verando said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historic remainder of human rights violations.
But the excuse to throw down is also almost untouched.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we have been committed to solving these violations, but it also takes a process.
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Verando appeared in a dialogue with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
He said, “Everything will be done according to the law.”
The United Nations has filed charges against Verando for the “crime against human rights” of more than 1,000 deaths in the bloody independent vote in East Timor in 1999, but he says 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Pania incident.
The families of the victims of the Panai incident resigned.
Yohanes said, “In the last three years, I have received four interviews, but things have not progressed at all.”
Years later he said, “I’m tired.”
He still lives in fear now.
He said, “I am afraid.
I'm afraid to be arrested by the army, I'm afraid to be shot.
His brother Yucabus also thought the people of Pania were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was hit by the army after helping to buri the four victims.
He said, “After the body was buried, the army came to me.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot down a village in the Deai County, in the neighboring province of Panai.
A building company manager refused to help carry a comed man to the hospital, where two sides were in conflict, one died and 17 were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Duo, drowned while fishing on the nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
The police said the villagers threw stones to the police, so the police shoot warning.
But the anti-violent mechanical forces (Indonesian Military Police) began to shoot the crowd and one was killed.
29-year-old Dominic Valley Bardi told Time magazine, “We were panic at that time, and now we are afraid they will repent that he was living near the hospital, when he witnessed the wounded being promptly sent to the hospital.
I was hiding at home for two days.
The Deai parliament has called for the involvement of the police to be brought to law and to withdraw the anti-bullying forces from the area.
Panai has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has raised the dissatisfaction of the people of the Mee, Moni, Dan, and Damal tribes, which are spread in the central heights of the Pani.
Many have joined the Liberal Papua Movement (OPM), a rebellion army that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people by dispersing attacks and attacks kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior leaders of the Liberal Papua movement were born in Pania, including Tadius Yughi and Daniel Yudas Kuga.
Thus, thousands of Panaians have been arrested and deliberately detained in recent years by the army on the basis of the "protection of national sovereignty".
Some have not appeared anymore.
In the eyes of the Papuians, Pania is a “land of forgotten tragedy.”
Poverty has raised dissatisfaction.
Enarotali’s rice is less poor in sale, and the locals can’t buy it at all.
Bread is far from accessible.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruits and leaves of vegetables.
Farming is the job of a woman, and every woman can take care of four or five pieces of potato.
They usually make the majority of the harvest for household purposes, and the remainder is placed on the local market for sale.
Ten potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rubles (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been triggered among local Papua and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has grown significantly since the new routes to the Navy Airport have been opened.
The small number of existing jobs usually fall into the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuians rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run a competitive company.
John Gobi, chairman of the Panai tribe council, said: “The young people don’t want to stay in this village... because there’s no job and no money here.”
Papua is isolated from the world.
The restrictions on international media reports remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basel Ronghan were expelled from Papua because they "not cooperated with the relevant agencies" even though they have rarely obtained a shooting authorisation.
According to the Vice-Director of the Human Rights Observatory in Asia, Phelim Cain, Zokovic’s reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development were not fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, “If foreign journalists try to report the most east Indonesian dissatisfaction in the provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at a new risk: refusing visa and pulling into the blacklist.”
No media surveillance means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is essentially limited to the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Toru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “a variety of general human rights violations” in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Liberal Papua Movement.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Almanata Nasil, was not concerned about the accusations of the group, he told the journalist in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system and the media is free, so evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to an informed person, on May 4, when Dutch human rights ambassador Case Van Bar led a delegation of officials to visit Chaapra, the local people broke the silence and cried, "We want freedom and he also attended that meeting, but requested anonymity.
Indonesia is scheduled to hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuians say they are unlikely to vote for Zokowi again.
The chairman of the tribal council, Gobi, said "Zokov's intentions are good, but everyone around him is involved in the Panye shooting."
He wanted Zokovi to know that the people of Pania are not only living under the threat of the hungry army, but they have nothing, the area has little education and public health care.
Goebbels said the Panai people, like the other Papuians, thought the votes they gave to Zokovi was a debt he had to pay.
He said, “They don’t need money, they need justice.”
Even under threats and threats, the families of the Panye shooting victims still make their last symbolic rebellion: buriing a victim's body in front of that military police station.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those guilty forget their crimes.
Yucabus said, “My family was killed.
What else can we do?”

Fire burns Dubai’s “Firewall” Tower again.
On Friday, a fire in a world's highest housing building in Dubai forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
This was the second massive fire over a high-end building in just two years, and accidentally occurred in the sky tower, known as the "firewall".
The building has been evacuated, no people have been injured and the cause of the fire has not yet been found.
“We were sleeping, then we were awake by firefighters, and people began to scream.
We run down the stairs and run from the 50th floor for about 10 minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said firefighters stopped the fire around 4 p.m. local time (Greenwich standard time 0000) and are undergoing heating processes for the building.
The government said it is trying to provide shelter to those affected.
The incident could again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of external wall materials in high buildings.
A survey conducted by the “Firewall” Sky Building Administration after its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were decorated and isolated covered outdoors.
The British police have said they believe the problem with the heat-isolation and covering panels in the London Greenfield building could be the cause of the June fire's rapid spread, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also suggested that Masha is likely to return, although he has already announced his resignation.
On January 9, the opening of the South Korean Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was only a month away, with the pre-heating and preparation work of the Olympics from the south to the north being carried out, the winter Olympics atmosphere in South Korea is increasingly intense.
The South Korean public is looking forward to this long-broken Korean talks, which can bring a "colored egg" for the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang for a month.
On the 1st of November, Pyongyang Winter Olympics arrived in South Korea.
The warmth of the Holy Fire directly reflects on the ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was only 32%, Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was only 4.3%, low ticket sales rate once made the outside world worried about the popularity of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
But as Pyongyang Winter Olympics Group Committee Chairman Li Hyun Van recently predicted to the journalists, "As the Winter Olympics Holy Fire is transmitted throughout Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is increasingly high, believing that the ticket sales will soon improve."
According to the South Korean media, by January 3, the sales of tickets for the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang have reached 64%, and the sales of tickets for the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang have also passed 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to visit South Korea, the South Korean Ministry of Justice also announced that it will extend the time of stay in South Korea for foreigners visiting Pyongyang Winter Olympics, with a maximum of 120 days of stay.
A survey found that more than one-fifth of U.S. passengers carried illegal goods on board.
A survey on aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had deliberately or deliberately carried illegal goods to the U.S. Transport Safety Authority checkstation, and at least 6% of passengers deliberately carried illegal knife or other knife to the air.
Less than 1% of passengers claim that they did not find missing weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted by the airline service company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. and the survey also found that young travelers were more likely to openly ignore the rules.
Recognizing that 19.7% of respondents who tried to deliberately carry TSA-prohibited goods on board were Millennium, compared to less than 15% of the X-Generation population.
The most common items that willingly escape TSA safety inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents acknowledged that they had deliberately carried a knife over the safety check, while 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men also said they had deliberately carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the survey was aimed at finding out the number of passengers accidentally carrying and deliberately carrying prohibited goods over aircraft safety check-in.
It is not surprising that the people who are most likely to carry the prohibited goods through the safety check-up — intentionally or unintentionally — are the people who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complex and difficult to understand.
People are often uncertain what and how many liquids they can carry.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the most TSA captured is the prohibited liquid.
People once believed that TSA might also consider books as a prohibited goods.
domestic flights are allowed to carry liquid, but international flights are not allowed to carry.
Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Prut, Changes Ideas on the Emissions Reduction Regulations of the Obama Age
A day after being prosecuted in 15 states, the Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Prout changed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama era of smoke-air emissions reduction regulations.
Prut proposed this change as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond faster to the needs of environmental regulatory state bodies compared to the previous government.
He did not mention the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal to his previous post.
The controversy focuses on setting the final deadline for the states to begin implementing the 2015 ground ozon standard on 1 October.
In June, Prut announced that he would delay the contract for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan, avoiding “interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was the Prosecutor General of Oklahoma, which has long been opposed to the stricting environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly shifted regulations that block or delay the chemical and fossil fuel industry’s opposition.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday was a latest legal obstacle on the agenda of the return of Prut regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency was overpowered to try to delay the execution of the Obama administration's requirements for oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakings.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Prut proposed his attitude towards ozon standards to be a big turning point, saying it is to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency, to cooperate with the states and take complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prut said, “Under the former government administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is usually unable to reach the specified deadline, then wait for the radical groups and other persons to appeal, and then agree through the agreement to determine the specified timetable that he has initiated a dozen charges against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
“We don’t believe the regulation that is carried out through the trial and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nevertheless, the Environmental Protection Agency said that Prout could again use his “release authorization and all other legally available authorisations” to ensure that the provisions are in accordance with “good policies and the best available information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a large scale of ozone layer regulations.
The House of Representatives Act, which was approved last month, aims to postpone the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York State Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the Alliance of States, has charged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s reversal – after our appeal – was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 1.15 billion Americans directly affected by smoke emissions.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhodes, Vermont and Washington, and Columbia D, joined the New York State and participated in the case.
Soil ozon is the common emissions of automotive, power plants, refiners, chemicals and other sources that are formed by reaction under sunlight in the atmosphere.
As a result, smoke causes severe breathing problems in sensitive populations, causing thousands of early deaths per year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmental professionals are pleased with the surprising transformation of Prut.
Lori An Bird, from the Biodiversity Center, said: “It is annoying that this common sense measure is under huge pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe.
“We must fight with the Trump administration to meet the pollutants and special interest groups.

In the morning of July 13, the U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit to the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent in its 2010 application.
The company has previously applied the same patents to ASUS, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit claimed that both iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated the U.S. patent number 7,657,386, which is called the Integrated Battery Service System.
The applicant wishes to receive a cash compensation or to charge a patent fee for the infringement equipment after the judgment was announced.
From the judgment of the prosecution, the prosecutor appears to believe the iPhone’s fast charging feature violates the company’s patent.
The iPhone with the fast charging feature will quickly charge the power to 80%, and then run the current charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent gangster” because the company does not offer clear products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court reconciliation on the patent with automotive manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.

Mor Beach Disaster: Activists Restore Racism Prison, Expand Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a group of viewers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, and runs toward the small Moor Beach Bridge.
The car carried four black passengers and a white driver, before the car arrived on the bridge, a group of white weapons walked forward and blocked the road to the car.
The head of the gang – a middle-aged man dressed in a thin shirt – smoked a cigarette deep, and his eyes looked into the windshield.
Passengers in the car were scared.
“We want – Roger!” the man screamed.
“Take him out of the car!”
A young black man was pulled down from the front-line passenger seat and a scream broke the silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 was just a repetition.
But, when Roger’s neck was covered, almost all the viewers surrounded the sound of a true breath.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, replaying the scene of the night that two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Marcon and George and Merry Dorothy – were hanged in 1946 by the Three K Party Prison.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
“While we know who they are, although we’ve seen them in the community, it’s incredible that no one of them has been arrested over the years,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
“This is the dirty point of history, it is the burden of our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgian parliamentary member and a lifelong activist.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable calling action, every year reminding the people of the Monroe community that injustice was never corrected.
“We want to prosecute, we want to end the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we must first get justice,” he said.
Unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation.
On July 27, 1946, the body inspector was placed on the body of a Mormon Beach prison victim.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation archives obtained by National Broadcasting News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding provinces are suspected of being involved in the prison.
No one of them was accused.
Although the number of suspects has been out of law for a decade, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the execution of private punishment is well known throughout the city: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a judgment of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial election later in that summer.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics, about at the same time, the black peternor Roger Malcolm killed the white land owner Barnett Hester in a struggle - seeming to be for a woman.
Brooks said the rumors in the town were that Hester was sleeping Marcom's wife Dorothy, and her baby was not of her husband.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on July 25, 1946, the high-quality white land owner Roy Harrison spent $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
Dorothy and his cousin McMurry and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from the prison, near to the Moor Beach Bridge, a group of persecutors surrounded the car.
“The fact is that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” a FBI report came to the conclusion.
It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, which not only participated in murder, destroyed evidence, but also hid the identity of witnesses.
Brooks is very short.
He said, “This is a voting right disaster.
“They were brutally killed, and the murderer sent a message to the black people in this community: ‘If you register and vote, you’ll have the same end.’”
For the past decade, Cassandra Greene has been responsible for the annual repetition of the Mole Beach Bridge disaster.
Her method of expression is clear, narrow and has a deep racist background. Many people want this racism to disappear in the United States.
It’s hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that’s the key.
“We don’t want to talk about sexual punishment, because sexual punishment makes us face the ugly side of everyone,” she said.
“But if you don’t listen to me, or don’t hear me tell about my own experience, I can’t build a relationship with you.”
This year’s show began in June, and on the first day there were 30 actors – dozens of white and the rest of black – stuck in one room to listen to the Greene released a well-trained show review.
Wade Malbo serves as Green's joint director.
He has been playing the role of the Three K Party for years, but he says that the role is never easy.
“I feel dirty because I’m not such a person,” Malbo said.
But I think it is very important to keep this history vivid because we don’t want to return to that time again.
In the room, the actors playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Huster, Dario Bradscho and Nick Lasconi, are tracing their speeches.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm screamed and pushed Hester and was angry about his sleeping wife Dorothy.
“I said, go out of my ground!”
Rashford is back.
Then they beat up.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) exploded a laugh.
Green laughed best.
“What’s happening?” asked Raskona.
He was scared and confused.
Do I play too much?
“No,” Green laughed.
“I just think white people don’t say ‘oh’.”
“Yes,” another black actor joked.
Your voice must be strong.
Thus, the energy in the room changes; the feeling of friendship disappears from the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do this, not only to perform the show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Raskona said the word “oh”, the voice was sharp and strong.
No one laughed.
The repetition ended strongly and quickly.
Crying, shooting, and then a silence.
A woman dressed in the funeral black dress stands on the side of the actor’s body and sings Billy Hallde’s regret “A Strange Fruit.”
Her voice suppressed other words.
A hundred meters away, about 40 viewers were constantly washing sweat and tears.
Nearly half of the audience were black and white.
A couple travelled from Isaka in New York to see the show, and many others lived near the street.
Brooks takes them to the funerals of Malcom and Dorothy, which is about eight hours away, and they all suffer the unpleasant humidity of Georgia.
Until this time, the murderer was still a fan. but now, standing on the same piece of the land that occurred, anxiety is filled in the air.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green invites people to get closer to some of the bodies that the actor plays.
The children slept down their heads, look at false blood and bodies, and steal each other’s private language.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy cried out, as if he was reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actress throwed the penalty belt and wiped her tears.
Brad Shaw embraced the three-k party leader dressed man Malbo.
Nick Lascona hugs up his two colleagues, crying out in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infect him.
“It doesn’t matter,” one of the women spoke low.
“We know that your heart is not like that.
You do that for a reason.
The audience then sat down to dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta talked closely with a black couple they just met and talked about the repeat.
Dennis Duplinsky was hard to find a word to describe her feelings after watching.
“It’s hard to imagine those terrible words and behaviors... that people like you speak and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“For me, it really made me think the persecution is still ongoing,” she added, “now this thing is just called police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits next to the table to watch, taste and taste citizenship rights.
He said he had started planning for the show next year.
“Recurring is an inspiring way, as it describes the horror we’ve experienced, but it’s also very educational,” he said.
“If you don’t learn from it, this could happen again.
Those who don’t study and don’t know their history are forced to repeat this.
The importance of the reform in the field of the “pipe network independence” in terms of the marketing reform of natural gas is unclear, but the resistance and controversy are also large.
The journalist was informed from Hanoi Keynes Group that at 11:25 a.m. on 7th morning, an explosion occurred in the Keynes Group Chemical Limited Lacting Workshop, located in Hanoi Province's Dongshan City Old Metallurgical District, where 13 operating persons were arrested.

After a year and a half of waiting, Jeren finally arrived in Beijing yesterday to present the first work of his upgrade father, as well as the 14th album of his musical career, The Story of Zhu Jeren Before Sleep.
Scientists from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University research laser satellites to clean spacecraft
Chinese scientists presented a bold proposal for innovation, using large laser to clean the Earth’s disturbed orbit and destroy the old satellite and its sky waste.
According to the U.S. News Weekly website on January 15, researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Sky Laser Cleansing Small Scale Space Fragment Transformation Model Study", which describes how space fragments can be radiated by laser to smaller, harmless fragments by using the Sky Platform Laser.
Space waste has been a matter of interest for the international space agency for many years, and the U.S. Space Agency has considered a variety of options for tracking, detection and removal of artificial fragments.
The method of cleaning large-scale spatial fragments includes the giant networks used for cleaning and collecting waste, as well as the magnets that can be used to absorb them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies, making the following conclusion that this will be the effective way to clean the Earth’s orbit.
The paper summarizes: "The (simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of the laser cleansing space fractures technology on the sky-based platform."
A 2014 study by the U.S. Defense Giant, Rockefeller-Martin, found that there were about 200 threats per day for satellites running along the orbit.
High-speed fragments along the Earth's orbit movement are considered a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts by the European Space Agency as "a fatal series of threats."
According to the U.S. "Volkswagen" Monthly Journal on January 17, space is basically empty, but the space close to Earth is increasingly crowded.Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of pieces operating around the Earth, and with time, these pieces will accumulate.
The more fragments, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still working properly is hit by fragments, causing damage to or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
According to the report, all space agencies have developed plans to clean up space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of fragments with jet gas to get them out of the orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large network, catching fragments and bringing them back to Earth, Japan's idea is to catch fragments with an electric chain.
Currently, China is also proposing a way to solve space waste, with a large laser to shed floating space waste into less harmful small pieces.
According to a group of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, a paper published in the German Optics Monthly Journal, such a laser installed on a satellite will clean space efficiently enough, at least based on the simulation results.
The only way to confirm its effectiveness is to be tested and there is no arrangement for such a task at the moment, but maybe soon someone will install the laser on the satellite and then send it to space.
Once this is done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space waste for ever.

Military bombers killed by suicide bombing in Kabul
According to official reports, a military unit was attacked by a suicide bomb in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several people.
NATO said five soldiers and one translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city’s Karabagh area.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - Tuesday's explosion in the Herat Mosque caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the explosion occurred on Thursday night, with joint patrols of Afghanistan and NATO coalition facing a "individual carrying easy-to-use explosive equipment" attack.
According to the statement, all the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital in Baghdad Air Force Base.
According to reporters, the Taliban in the Karabakh region and the so-called Islamic State (IS) increasingly raised serious concerns from NATO forces located near Baghdad.
According to the United Nations statistics, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the death toll in the capital was about 20%.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bombing in the mainly Shiite region of Kabul in late July.
The Taliban said they had launched the attack.
A massive explosion in the center of the city of Kabul on May 31, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest terrorist attack in the country since the US-led multi-national forces overturned the Taliban in 2001.
The incidents highlighted the U.S. President Donald Trump’s consideration of the security situation in Afghanistan while adding troops to support its armies and police.

The U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revoke the resolution after the trial, delaying smoke regulations
Obama, at his time in office, made a regulation requiring the states to restrict different types of emissions that cause smoke, and 15 states appealed to the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency for the regulation.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday announced its decision to continue the so-called "Ozone 2015" and promised that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will cooperate with the states.
Scott Prout, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement: “We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and committed to responding to it.
Prout announced in June that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to postpone the implementation of the ozon-defined zone standard to October 2018, with a postpone of one year - according to that standard, the existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce the emissions that cause smoke pollution in order to meet the air quality standards.
15 major Democratic states and the Colombian District have appealed on Tuesday, declaring the act illegal.
As part of the wider agenda, President Donald Trump’s authorities have been trying to restore the various environmental regulations promoted by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts triggered opposition from the Democrats and conservative groups who fear more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on its website that breathing of oxygen-containing air “disrupts the function of the lungs, increases the symptoms of the respiratory tract, such as asthma and so on.”

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomachinko meet for the first time to explore the future of a decisive battle.
The most remarkable boxing match under 147 pounds will be held soon, with Vasily Lomachinko and McKee Garcia, who are currently in a potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
In their separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia first went down the corridor and greeted the World Boxing Organization superweight champion Romachinko.
In the Showtime boxing match held on Saturday, the judge agreed that Garcia defeated the four-ranking world champion Adrian Brona to win, making the two boxers the top five players on the weight list.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “Champion, hello?
I wish you good luck 🙂
In the ESPN match at 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Romachinko defeated Miguel Mariaga, preserving his position.
When the two photographed, Romachinko’s broker Egis Klimas pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depends on the “perfect size.”
“I’ve been lightweight before,” Garcia Tito said.
“I raised the level to fight against Brona (140 pounds), but I didn’t weigh so much.
Compared to 140 pounds, my weight is slightly less.
I want to go back to the light level.
And he has to reach the light level (135 pounds), and then we can fight.
That is what fans want.
We will be satisfied with them.
Romachinko agreed to this.
The boxing world needs this fight.
Climas asked if he should pay a regular fee, and his part of strategy was to allow Romachinko to play the first match with a 135 pounds player later this year, thinking that a date will be agreed with Garcia (37-0, 30 elimination) next summer. Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the match against Jorge Linares-Luc Campbell after the 23th September Forum Lightweight Boxing Championship.

“We are the main characters.
Others cannot bring such a lot of attention.
As long as they are ready...”
Garcia appreciates Romachinko as a "excellent player" and may be on the site to watch his Saturday boxing match.
But Romachinko was hesitated about Garcia's praise, saying he thought this triangular champion from Riverside appeared "very slow.
Garcia said the focus was to show the strength of the bowl and then the boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing game.
“This is the fight that must be carried out.
Attention and warmth are unavailable to other boxing matches.
I am very pleased to participate,” Garcia said.
Romachinko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, this time it’s the turn of McKee.”
It will be a great battle.

The statement of officials of the China Development Committee on the 11th Emission Reduction Goals was made in advance, allowing the steel industry under the limitation of electricity production to have strong re-production expectations.
Although the current steel factory has not received a clear notification of the local government announcing the end of the energy-saving emissions reduction work, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the original-limited steel factory will be successively completed re-production, the price of steel or will begin to be under pressure.
There is no notification of the end of the limitation of electricity production yet, but in fact the pressure of various enterprises has been significantly lower than in October 9, a private steel entrepreneur in Hanoi Province told reporters.
Some areas of Hanoi have repeatedly issued electricity limit production documents, and once taken a compulsory way to restrict enterprise production.
The reporters learned from local enterprises that most of Hanoi’s steel plants have been rebuilt, reducing production pressure.
My steel network analyst Zhang Zhejiang anticipates that as the north is already in winter, the terminal demand for construction steel will be gradually weakened by strengthening.
In addition to the gradual end of energy-saving emissions, after December 15, most steel plants will be based on re-production, and the products will reach all markets in a row before the New Year.
The increased supply of resources will make the current rise in the price of steel under some pressure.

The latest results of the Swedish refugee age assessment test
Swedish refugees tested using the latest methods to medically evaluate their age, and the latest results showed that more than 80% of the respondents were judged over the age of 18, but not everyone believed their accuracy.
The Swedish National Center for Legal Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) began this test earlier this year.
After allegedly failing to accurately assess some of the age of alleged minor refugees, the Migrationsverket has designed these tests to make a more accurate age assessment during the refuge process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Authority has sent 6880 cases and the Legal Medical Center has currently published the results of a total of 2481 cases between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002 people) were estimated to be over the age of 18 or older, but in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Law Medical Center also determined the subject "may be over the age of 18 or older."
In 432 trials, the result was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The test is aimed only on people with age doubts.
According to John Granson of the Center for Legal Medicine, these results coincide with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: “These data did not differ much from the data from the previous months, and the numbers were very consistent.”
The high percentage of cases that are considered to be older than 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these refugees lie about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said there were 442 cases "which indicate that the respondent was over 18 years old or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed 581 of the test results published this year and found that 243 of them had been publicly said they would be over 18 years old this year.
X-ray screening on the mental teeth, nucleomagnetic resonance screening on the joints, and then the results are analyzed by dentists and radiologists, this method of medical assessment is also questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Caroline College, whose work includes evaluating the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have experienced adolescence earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have a reason to think that, and I think the measurement method used should not be that."
In this way, the physiological age is not accurate.
If we can’t guarantee accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend we can do it.
However, Granson of the Center for Legal Medicine defends the accuracy of these tests: “It can generally be said that judging a child is a small risk of uncertainty for an adult.”
The biggest risk is that this person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10%.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at the meeting of President Trump that he would change the party.
“Like or not, the Democrats have gone away from me,” the Governor’s judge said.
“Today, after I have done a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I’m going to tell you...Today I’m going to tell you as a West Virginia, I can’t help you again as a Democratic Governor.”
The gathering broke a joy.
“So tomorrow I’m going to change party citizenship to a Republican party,” Jastis added.
“As a coach, I want to tell you it’s time to start another match.
Trump earlier in a meeting in West Virginia promised to make a major announcement.
Mr. Trump won a 42% vote in West Virginia, while Justin did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was elected the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father’s coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, his cost is approximately $15.9 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "The exchange of Governor Jastis is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not but prevent our country from becoming great again, but will rather make our country great again."
“Democrats currently have only 15 governors, and the number of governors in the state parliament is the lowest in history, and Justin’s statement is the latest rejection of such a political party that loses leadership from up to down and cannot find a positive unity slogan,” said Rona McDaniel, President of the Republican National Committee, in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praised Russia's " honest" apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the chairman of the International Sports Federation, Sebastian Koe, appreciated Russia’s apology for the doping scandal and said that the apology was “right,” but he reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoice in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Sports Federation, Mithri Hirakdin, said at the International Sports Federation Congress held in the eve of the World Sports Championship that his country was prohibited from taking part in the sport was right, and he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he's sorry "all the athletes who won the gold and silver medals in the match were deprived of the medals."
Although he made such comments, the Tada International Congress still voted in favour of the maintenance of the ban. Earlier, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report mentioned evidence that the Russian state sponsored the use of the doping, the ban was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today’s response is a very honest and very honest introduction,” Tada International Chairman Co told reporters.
"The entire Council and the United Nations Congress are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has experienced a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can rejoice in the competition.
Co said he was also "heavily" that Russia accepted the standards for re-election.
“I think it’s a very constructive day and I think we’ve made some progress, but the Tada Congress supports the proposals of the project group and it’s not time to restore Russia’s qualifying to participate in the competition,” Ko said.
“We need to do our best in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guidelines have always been hoping to separate innocent athletes from the polluted systems,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes, which meet the strict standards of the International TFA, will participate as neutral athletes in the World Sports Championship held in London on Friday.
Wuhan Anderson, the head of the TFA Special Group, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met a number of criteria for the restart of the competition.
After a speech to the International Federation Council in London, he told reporters that the drug testing was still not enough and the banned coach was still trained.

The Federal Reserve published a brown book that shows that almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions moderate to moderate growth in early 2018 and remain optimistic about the outlook for this year.
At the same time, the U.S. unemployment rate in December remains at 4.1%, the lowest since 2000, and are expected to raise wages in the next few months.

What is the impact of football’s financial rules on Neymar’s transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing the unlimited expenditure of the European Grand Prix Football Club will not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish Barcelona Club to the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at a record price.
The result was the European Football Association (UEFA) implementing further decrease on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.The European Football Association (UEFA) is the management body of the European Football Games and has the right to prohibit teams from participating in the European Champions League.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) launched by the UEFA in 2011 means that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club must ultimately prove that Neymar’s transfer is funded without causing huge losses.
The club has already paid €2.2 billion ($2.62 billion) for paying the break fee for the Brazilian player, while Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial impacts of Neymar's transfer to France.
Given the funds of the team coming from the rich Qatar ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can, of course, sign a contract with Neymar in cash and incorporate him into other Star Cloud teams.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on buying players, but they have to use a legitimate source of income to compensate for the huge amount of money they spend, so they can a profit balance in football related business.
The Rules of the Financial Fair Competition is the idea proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected president of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for those clubs that are building high bonds for success, if the bank or everyone withdraws support funds, they are actually cheating and putting the club at the risk of destruction.
In 2011, The Rules focused on moving from the club’s debt issue to the club’s loss monitoring.
This change means that Roman Abramovich used the business model when acquired Chelsea Club in 2003, to buy a potential club and then spend a lot of money on improving the team and building it a global brand, now facing a more challenging situation.
In the three-year Rules assessment period of 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Despite Abu's degradation by his current president in 2015, UEFA's successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excess expenditure.
“Naturally the rules have not failed yet, and we’re sure we’ll strengthen the future regulations,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the rules, told the U.S. agency last week.
Although the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay Neymar’s purchase terms once, it can also allocate amounts for accounting purposes within the contract period.
Neymar has already signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fees may show a cost of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts of the next five years.
The first wave of the "Rules" sanctions in 2014 made the Paris Saint-Germain football club, as well as the Manchester City club under Abu Dhabi, the strictest sanctions.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was sentenced to a fine of €60 million (as the exchange rate at the time was $82 million), which later decreased to €20 million, and demanded the team to reduce players to 21 in the 2014-15 Champions League season, rather than normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking at the clubs that try to raise income and deceive the financial regulators by connecting with the club owners.
While Qatar's companies can sponsore the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, if the sponsorship amount is considered to exceed the standard market price, then the UEFA will not consider it a legal income.
This was what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the amount of Qatar Tourism Authority sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was exaggerated.
It is that a part of Neymar's earnings from the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club may be from the 2022 Qatar World Cup Group Committee's payments.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the group committee deny that Neymar will be the world cup ambassador, and it is easy for the regulatory authorities of the UEFA to take such action.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club means that the UEFA will be more alert in any attempt to escape the rules.
On Thursday, officials said the UEFA did not discuss the transfer of Neymar in advance with the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The above-mentioned persons only contacted the United States Federation in an unnamed identity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Last-published accounts show the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club’s operating revenue in 2015-16 amounted to €5.424 billion, profiting over €10 million.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been published.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club is expecting that Neymar’s membership will bring the gospel to sponsorship activities, concessions and the sale of socks.
The club is expected to increase the revenue after the signature of Neymar by at least 30%.
Obviously, seeing the most famous players leave, the Spanish League is deeply angry, trying to prevent Neymar's move and claiming the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club breaches the Rules.
The Western League chairman, Havel Tebas, told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a 'financial doping' that the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has the final ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsenal's (all of the club's people are the American sports giant) coach Arsene Wenger, holds reservations on the state-funded club's attitude as well as the Western League.
“This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
Once the country has a club, everything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or different interests for a country to require a big card player to represent a country.

The story of Hindu Chuan King Liu An in the traditional Chinese culture, discarded in the traditional case of "Liu An to do tofu, because of the mistake made", tells the story of the protagonist "Tofu" by a bean illuminated into a human shape, overcoming heavy difficulties, persisting in the dream of Chuan Chuan.
The Wuhan Mountains in Lake North, is one of the United Nations World Cultural Heritage sites, and is also the source of the Doyle culture and Wuhan martial arts, known as "Wuhan Mountains Without Double Victory, Heavenly First Shandong."
The director Zhou Zhou revealed that in the early period of the film creation, he had travelled with the lead creator team to Wuhan Mountain.
He said that the story of "Toofu Legend" took place in the years of West Hanoi, under the background of Qingnan King Liu An Qing Dan Qing, the film's protagonist "Toofu" was a bean that was accidentally imagined to be a human shape when Liu An Qing Dan.

The Old Infectious Power Markets – The Halla Summer Camp and The Detective Twin
The story is recalled to remind the actors of the 80s and the 90s of the waste age (David Wayne and Michael Zhuwatt for MTV's filming comedy "Nation"); and also the memories of the old age itself, the memories of 2001; this year before, many stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther, have not survived.
As a cultural artwork, it is the imitation and reflection of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The Camp's First Day was strong after broadcast, but it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (the story is about the original story of a talking vegetable container, sounded by H. John Benjamin).
The double application of the core smiles in the drama - the middle-aged actors play a child of a positive age - which makes it unable to return back to the past also a funny part.
In The Ten Years Later, adults really play adults, the emotions are not too deep, imitation is even more widespread, including improved creations of the 1990s film tracking, such as The Hand of the Rock.
At a moment, a character falls between an Apple notebook, some straight-line ice shoes and "some other things in 1991".
Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart has now become a novelist, but he’s still not forgotten Kate (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) still keeps the body of the female.
In the series, there is another terrible conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Schwartz), driven by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake, making a deep impression).
As always, the best part of this series is the insert.
It was interesting to see this forever young Lord Luther, who showed the soul patches of Matt Dylan in the film The Single Aristotle, and Andy in the former Campus Giant now feels like a giant.
It’s an accidental crazy moment that might give the film the power, like the seven years of life series, until the conclusion that I think is logical: The Halla Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later, the last scene of which is to let the casts go to the film premiere of the Halla Summer Camp.
At the same time, Amazon’s Detective Twin tells about different antiquities: the American Spy of the Cold War Renaissance, the movie The Cold Cities, and even the Eastern Glow: Beautiful Women’s Glow Alliance.
This comedy, created by Brian Gettwood and Alexander Tandy, was directed by Rice Thomas on a TV screen: a hard brother-brother comedy, a dramatic background set in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials struggling for the truth, the atheism and the Marxist-Leninism path.
The main characters - the hardist Gregor and the idealist Ethereum - are played by Little Florin Pierce and Cornell Ulic, respectively, whose dialogue is composed by Channing Tatum (as well as the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit in English.
This is a great idea.
But this is not just an idea.
Some of them were good visual screws (the police watched the satellite on television and spending time because the Americans like to play football).
And many famous actors - including Jenny Slet, Nick O'Overman, Mahshara Hashbaz Ali and Colo Sevini - created a wonderful sound event.
But the Detective Twin is so committed to creating a noise-real propaganda comedy - in the drama there is a killer with the head of the Drygan mask - and it usually also plays such a role.
This six-second television is slightly traced, and the comedy effect is not released quickly or frequently enough.
The long editing of The Detective Twin is more rigorous, with a better stimulating and ironic effect when Gregor and Ethereum repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, as there are always two thick wolves in the embassy’s hall to throw a set of hamburgers.
For the imaginary communist audience, this message means that Western culture can transform anything into material to celebrate.
The creators of this Romanian theme fictional story are not wrong, and we will even tell stories with our own modern history and their history.
The reporters recently interviewed that the efficiency of the industries such as steel, orbit transport, ships, machinery manufacturing in the northeastern region has generally decreased, and there are even losses.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, the new round of resuscitation of the northeastern industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development and international competitiveness of China’s manufacturing industry, and therefore it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
Enterprise efficiency generally decreases Traditional industry repaired losses of raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment manufacturing efficiency seriously decreases and even occurred losses, is the first manifestation of this round of economic decline in the Middle East and North East industry.
Previously in the economic decline, mainly the low-end, primary products are greatly affected, but in this economic volatility, traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
Sitting Steel Group (Microsoft) in the previous years from adjusting the product structure, focused on the development of high-end plates such as container plates, steel tracks, shipping plates and civil household plates, however this year the sales of these varieties occurred significantly decreased, especially shipping plates sales decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year.
Seth steel shares (Liaoning Province Industrial and Communications Commission Metallurgical Department Director Hu Cheng Shui presented that metallurgical is Liaoning's third largest pilar industry, with the annual production of 60 million tons of steel production capacity ranked third in the country.
On May 1, this year, Liaoning province's gross steel production was 2,154 million tons, the state policy encouraged, the local government's efforts to build projects needed product production and sales conditions were better, the market competition was more intense and the product decline was more large, it was another feature of the northeastern manufacturing industry.

The Japan Olympic Committee recently said that the delegation of Japan in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics targeted 30 gold medals, and ran into the top three in the gold list.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will later announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged, with previously weak economic growth and relaxed inflation leaving upheads hoping to break down.
The Bank of England has issued a warning that the economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it controls the interest rates while strengthening the family’s income cut.
The bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) decision makers decided to maintain 0.25% interest rates with 6-2 votes, while this month a minority of members called for increased interest rates, even if weak economic growth has weakened the support of the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued warnings that household income cuts will continue, while inflation will rise to 3% in the autumn.
But he said there will be a need to raise the interest rates in the coming years to reduce the inflation that leads to Brexit, while loans may need to rise more significantly than the financial markets expect.
A large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented a year ago due to the impact of the Brexit, and the members also voted for the decision to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of its regular funding plans, starting in February of next year, providing cheap funding to the banks, although the bank said that according to the plan, the bank currently needs to add £15 billion on the basis of £115 billion.
The Bank of England said: “In MPC’s core forecast, GDP remains weak in recent years, as the real income cut will continue to suppress consumers.
As for the interest rates, the bank repeatedly reiterated the need for a "specific monetary policy retardation" to suppress inflation, and the need for a "greater degree" than the market expected.
The current market is expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the line emphasizes that any upgrades will be “later” and “resistant”.
The line's growth forecast has a decline trend this year and next year, with the forecast for May 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bankins an 1.8% growth for 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, and the euro followed it.
The pound against the dollar fell 0.5%, to 1.31, and the euro fell 0.4%, to 1.11.
Before this continuous decision appeared, increasing expectations of rise broke down due to recent unoptimistic growth data: GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to only 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3%, although it would be a slight increase at the end of the year.
Ordinary families are in the shock of inflation, while wages are unimportant, and the recent inflation reports of the Bank of England don’t bring good news to them, as the bank says the recession will become worse before it becomes better.
He said the monetary policy "no can prevent" the impact on income in the coming years, but the wages are expected to "growth" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, due to the devaluation of the pound, the demand for British goods will grow significantly, the economy will be stimulated and compensate for the impact of some low consumption.
A year before the decision was made, the shocking referendum in the European Union caused the pound to fall, with the interest rates dropped to 0.25 percent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to have a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
Before the bank announces its latest interest rate ruling, the rise of the interest rate will not be heard, as the inflation has bursted the normal households that have long been under pressure, while three decision makers have called for the interest rate to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said it was in anticipation and will rise again in the next few months.
The line calls its 2% target, and the exceeding part is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montreck, Chairman of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in the interest rate, the mortgage loan market seems to become more competitive again, as the lender strongly calls for more business and hopes to set the perfect score for this year with a positive attitude.
Such a market seems beneficial for those who may be about to end existing transactions, as re-hypotheses (many can be free of procedural fees and low interest rates) are becoming more and more popular.
China earthquake network officially measured that on November 13 at 19.02 a.m. in New Zealand (42.53 degrees south width, 173.05 degrees east) occurred a 8.0-degree earthquake, the earthquake source was 10 km deep, the capital Wellington earthquake was strong.
The UK National Health Service System (NHS) opens green lights for controversial HIV drugs
After the Supreme Court’s decision on NHS’s drug funding, patients will be able to get “changing” HIV preventive treatment starting in September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure preventive drug (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by approximately 86%.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court's ruling last year. the ruling said that although NHS claims that local authorities should provide funding for the drug, NHS has the right to pay the PrEP costs.
The action announced on Thursday was called a “important new intervention” by British NHS CEO Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust Foundation (NAT) described it as a “critical moment.”
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first group of registered sex health clinics; more clinics will be joined in October, and will be fully implemented in April 2018 across England.
Pre-exposure preventive drug (PrEP) is a HIV drug that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests show that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV in the risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there is enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The groups that are eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender and HIV-positive carriers who fail to receive treatment.
The clinic will identify the participants who are qualified and agree to the test, including men, women, transgender persons and their sex partners, whether they are HIV-infected by an unknown person receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Those who live in England and are registered with a general doctor may also be registered at their local sexual health clinic.
The plan will cost £10 million and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to buy these drugs this week after a competitive international purchase.
The experiment aims to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is placed, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should have a broad and increasingly successful complementary and enhanced role in the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone for more than 30 years of progress in addressing the major human health challenges.
Depola Kim, Chief Executive Officer of the UK AIDS Trust Fund (NAT), said: “This is a critical moment for fighting AIDS.
If it is actually aimed at people in need and at risk, then pre-exposure preventive drugs provide the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, HIV high-risk populations will receive a licensed new tool through the NHS-funded experiment in England, which is truly independent and without consultation with sex partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We both support this announcement.
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Trens Higgins Trust Foundation, said: “Today’s primary task is to ensure that the tests are launched rapidly across the country and that no one of the HIV-infected people can fall.
Now we’ve bought the PrEP test drug and we’ve been prepared to protect more than 10,000 people with HIV high risk.

High quality of life: applied cabinets and smart designs, making the Counthood's small apartment a spacious house
Joanne Ray, a former bankier, was very passionate about the repair of the houses, and in 2014 she moved from the big house on the Knight Bridge to the county's small apartment.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen's terrace - Joanne doesn't pack baggage to sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before that, I and my former boyfriend lived in a larger house in the Knight Bridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment in the Count Palace and its roof was also high.
I was very pleased, that day I proposed to make a deal.
Since the first visit, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely renovated.
This apartment was originally a complex layout single room — it took to pass through the kitchen to go to the bedroom — and Joanne wanted to increase storage space and roof to take full advantage of the sufficient roof height.
“I want high roofs, big windows, enough light.
That’s my request,” she said.
For this purpose, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in the Notting Mountains) to use this 12.5-foot ceiling to carefully build a house that is not only a development project, but also the place where Joanne lives.
The height of the roof is not enough to add two up-to-down spaces, so the construction challenge is to create a height of a roof that stands standing enough.
Elvan must play creative minds to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We need to arrange a good space, make it up and down, and don’t need to throw on the back of the arrow.
It’s not just so simple to build a simple platform, it’s also to start these steel so that it’s at the right height to realize the function.
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-length rooms in the space — which could add many entertainment elements.
The roof has a retrouvius brand rectangular bronze window with a view to the charming area of living.
The gold furniture with mirrors, the silver small furniture and the Serge Mouille Renaissance lighting set up the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Placing a mirror on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror protective board is like a window that leads to another room.
At the door, a mirrored small shell provides Joanne with storage space for storing food and glass dishes.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space, which can accommodate the kitchen when the kitchen is not used.
The coated kitchen is not fresh.
But the unique feature of this overlaped kitchen is a garage-style lifting door.
“This involves some knowledge in the fields of engineering,” Elvan explains the steel moisturizing MDF door.
“This is the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it’s easy to slide.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne got an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“In the end, what you sell is the area of the house—or your property’s value is based on the area of the house,” Elvan says.
Basically, the real estate broker will go into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor.
They will try to increase the occupation space while using high-quality materials, bringing a sense of luxury to this space.
Elvan says, “The material is your own choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds at home.”
“You don’t love the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they won’t catch your heart.
It turned out that with a good design as well as an additional area, the standard apartments can turn around to make you surprising.
In fact, you might choose to stay like Joanne.

Two Brothers Play $500 Million Real Estate Empire Fighting the World War
40 years after their Italian family founded the Duchy, the two brothers began a war for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth more than $500 million.
Former Calton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a luxury house located in the Tucara district, where the three doors are away from his brother Paul's home.
Paul has been trying to get rid of the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had intense disputes in the Supreme Court on the division of assets.
The brothers and their mother have a total of 38 assets worth more than $500 million, which have been constantly accumulated since the family bought the Colinwood District Smith Street in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail stores.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
Currently, the portfolio of the D. Ruthis family assets include the city office building, the Bologna and Solento development projects, the Gold Coast and the Blesh Mountains apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with his deceased father, Colin, known as his brother Paul as the "main driver and dominant person" of the De Ruthis family, owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets, while Paul accounts for about one-third.
The documents submitted to the court stated that Colin’s assets were worth $3.16 billion, while Paul’s assets were worth $1.76 billion.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash is proof of the conclusion of negotiations.
“The property distribution recommendation proposed by Colin left him the best property I think,” he wrote in a first court swear in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failures in mediation.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for the control of the existing business, Paul says Colin has thrown him out of the office.
Colin denies this and accuses Paul of failure to manage certain real estate.
In the early swear submitted by Colin, he said he wanted to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option.My Italian origin determines that family is the most important,” he writes.
The costs of the case are rising, and there are hundreds of pages of swears, e-mails, and corporate reports submitted by companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers employed by the two sides.
Mrs. Ruthis and her deceased husband, Louis, were both Italian immigrants, who began to operate a mass food and cooking store since the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunei in the early 1970s.
They used mortgage to buy Colinwood’s property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans shop.
Colin said, “I’m studying at high school at three,” where he founded Westco, “when Paul was still young (about 10 years old).
Anna de Ruthis says she and Louise, who died in 2012, are hoping to be able to peacefully transfer the property to her son.
“Luigi often told me he never wanted his brothers to come to court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the D-Routis Group, and Colin says Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and paid Luke $26 million.
Paul said Luke and Mark were both "unhappy with their property distribution terms."
According to the biography published in 2015 by TV star Eddie McGuire, although Colin was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club, he remained low.
“Fairfax Media” on Friday contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers.
But only Colin responded through text messages. he said because the case has been submitted to the court "I really can't say too much"
“My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which was very, very sad,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
He said, “Our father doesn’t want to see Paul and I eventually happening such a current dispute,” and added, “he’s still hoping for a solution to the dispute.”
On Friday, this hope seemed to be broken down.
“Our issues will be resolved by court in the near future,” Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief executive plans to limit presidential media time
Others have tried, but all ended with failure.
John F. Kelly could really do it.
If that is true, he is the first.
According to the U.S. political news site Politico, the new White House secretary plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in order to ensure that the boss is more stable.
Here is a quote from the journalist Josh Doyce:
“When the new White House Secretary John F. Kelly began the first day of his work to gather discussions with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to solve one of the main issues of President Trump’s entry into the White House: the flow of bad information in the presidential hands.”
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, and that the information needs to be through his hands—whether in writing or in briefing form.
Kelly’s diagnosis seemed similar, but others had also tried to overthrow him by monitoring Trump’s media time, but they ended with failure.
President Trump’s television addiction has long come from – now in the White House, his TV viewing habits are still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico, “If the candidate Trump is disappointed by unfair reports, let him know that he’s also received positive reports through reliable channels will be very beneficial.”
Politico’s Tala Palmery wrote: “According to the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus on controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media information always contains some praise.
This is absolutely no problem.
But Trump’s Twitter habits once “controlled” the view was ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something we don’t know—that if they didn’t interfere with them, Trump’s Twitter would be even more burning.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff could save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one could ever stop Trump from triggering controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House consisting of a competitive group, people promote their worldview and flowering their career by submitting Trump possibly reliable and possibly unreliable information.
Politico – all about this story – in May that consultants had the preference to provide suspicious information to the president’s strategicity.
This is an example described by the journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"The current and former Trump officials said that Trump's reaction to negative news pieces like a volcano eruption, especially those that are destructive information leakings, he would crazyly want to find its source.
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on the site of the cyber-stimulator Charles C. Johnson GotNews.com to the president, accusing Deputy Secretary-General Katy Walsh of being the "source of a large amount of information disclosure" when Trump was the same.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, he did not provide any specific evidence, and he had exploded a lot of errors and later openly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsch’s situation.
Goodmancher also said that the then Chief of Staff Reynes Privas and White House Secretary Robert Potter “has tried to build a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump.”
What is the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing, three months later.
He may be able to prove himself a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump remains the impulse of Trump, and his assistants are still competing with each other and fighting for influence.
These eternal influence factors would make Kelly’s task harder.

Rental passengers negotiate the channel and return to "Rich Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands are again in dispute with the strongest rental passengers, who are consulting about a government-opened gateway, requiring the return of the land outside the houses.
Passengers parked their 20 trucks on an empty ground outside the vibrant Solihel Street, which was crowned "Rich Street".
The rental passengers took their horses, hugged the babies and led the rental car team, and returned again after they were evacuated in May, and the "Guardians of the City River" that the municipal authorities had gathered did not stop them from entering.
The squad found that the line of defense had a gap, and although there was a road that did not set a barrier suitable for passing, their vehicles stumbled through that gap.
Angry inhabitants criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was “badly performing when dealing with this issue.”
One unknown resident said, “They arrived there on Monday night, before they came to the Benilith Street, throwing stones on the passing people.
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, because they are simply no place to deal with the issue.
The passengers arrived here in May, and then were evacuated, and now they’re back.
There was a lot yesterday night, and there could be more today.
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with the way it protects its parks by implementing a long-term ban.
I live in Streetbrook Road, and if parliament cannot stop this, I will not be willing to continue paying municipal taxes.

This time the number increased again, some even saw a horse eating grass on the park grass.
A spokeswoman for the Soliher committee said: “We know that someone is doing unauthorized campings on an empty ground on the Suarez Brook Road, and now we work with Soliher police and take the necessary legal action to let them move away as soon as possible.”

Italy has a strong attitude towards NGO migration rescue vessels
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migration rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not continue to carry out the rescue without signing new operations management standards.
In an interview with the Turkish Daily News, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said: “It’s hard to see what they’re going to think if non-governmental organizations don’t sign new rules of conduct.
On the day before Minnesota issued a warning, Italian officials arrested the crew on a ship of the German aid organization "Youth Rescue" for suspicion of actually intercepting human traffickers and helping illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for just a year and refused to comment on the specific accusations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio.
The organization said in a social media statement, “For us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing, so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area.
“After we have collected all the information, we can only evaluate all the accusations and the situation.”
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa ship, which is the youth rescue organization, since October.
The crew is suspected of carrying human traffickers directly by small ships and allowing the traffickers to escape quickly and reuse the ships.
According to the prosecutor’s document record, at least one such encounter was alleged to occur in the sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of openly neglecting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which is committed to humanitarian enthusiasm and not any other motivation to monitor the rescue operations in the area.
According to the rules of conduct, ships like Juventa clearly need an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on the ship.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in the search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the rules of conduct, respectively: the Children's Rescue Association, the Maltese Immigration Maritime Assistance Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that he considered the new provisions unnecessary, but acceptable, as these provisions do not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to his rescue operations.
The organizations that refused to sign included the Nobel Prize winner’s Organization for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks has decreased drastically, which indicates that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and joint local mayor’s efforts have first seen results.
The minister said: "In the past few days, we have begun to see the sunrise at the end of the tunnel.
He announced the plans for deep talks this month: discussing economic development activities with the Libyan mayor and discussing how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

The fire department of Shenyang City immediately sent 5 of the 20 fire vehicles carrying heavy anti-chemistry clothes, anti-chemistry washing vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After initial investigation, the fire was a small storage container of chemicals such as four hydrocarbons, which produced a larger smoke on the site.
At the time of the press release, firefighters are in tension with the rescue, the municipal health, security, environmental protection, security, transport and other departments have been on track to the scene, no people have been killed.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide for sending text messages to Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for suicide by SMS and telephone.
The current 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment and can be converted to a delayed imprisonment.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional murder against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday's hearing: "My family is sad.
My son is my best friend.
During waiting for the appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal freedom.
She is faced with a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe she and Mr. Roy both have a mental illness.
At the time of the judgment, Carter stood, wearing a red long shirt and a pink shirt, with his hands tight, his eyes with tears, and his eyes down.
“His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“He ended his life for himself to live better.
She is not responsible,” the prosecutor said.
“She has no regret.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence, she felt very regret.”
However, Lawrence Moniz’s judge said he didn’t find her “age or maturity, and even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior.”
A prosecutor who read a statement from Lynn Roy’s mother, said, “I’m not sad for a day not to lose my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of all that I have done.I’m struggling to stand with his sisters in all my suffering that will accompany us forever,” the statement said.
Mr. Roy’s sister, Caddy Roy, testifies that she’s “minded” because she realizes that she’s never able to attend her brother’s wedding or be the aunt of his children.
“Lost a person who has accompanied me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be with this pain.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not prescribe that anyone else is guilty of suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in the car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text messages revealed that after her suicide, the case raised national attention.
"There are a lot of ways to hang, jump, shoot herself, she said in a number of text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on a vacation with his family.
The time before his suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad,” “All you have to do is start the generator and then get freedom and happiness.”
The judge Moniz said Carter was worried about Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to gain profit from the case through any media.
There is a legal dispute in this case.
Amanda Knox is one of them, accused of killing her British room friend in Italy in 2007 and two years later declared innocent.
The 30-year-old Nox said in a column article published in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter is worthy of sympathy and help, rather than imprisonment.”
Zhang Zhang is a controversial film artist, since he began filming the first film "Red Gong", he has always led the Chinese film trend, and has also raised a lot of controversy.
The journalist was informed from the Lhasa Clean Land Basketball Club that recently, Lhasa Clean Land Basketball Youth Team won the fourth place in the National Youth Basketball League final held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Clean Land Baseball Youth Team consists of 11 local players, the main coach is Lhasa Clean Land Men's Basket Adult Team Assistant Trainer Shen Rinsan Pearl.
The Tibetan "Basketball Boy" before going to Beijing to participate in the final.
Liu Yong Super, Chief Executive Officer of the Lhasa Clean Land Basketball Club, told reporters that the performance of the team has progressed compared to last year, the confidence of the players and the confidence of the game field have increased significantly.
After the match ended, Captain Jiang Yi said he wanted to do his best for the basketball career in Tibet by participating in the match.
It is known that in the match in Beijing, the players overcome low-level oxygen and demonstrated the Tibetan image.
Although the sport at the Olympics is a gold medallion, the sporters are given the heavens, the sport name will be lower than the sporting gold.
Automotive manufacturers face shock, Audi will repair up to 850,000 diesel cars
One day before Audi announced the repair, BMW said it will provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s chairman said BMW believes that “driving has more intelligent options than limitations,” meaning major European cities – including the BMW headquarters in Munich – consider to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will rebuild three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company claimed that the move was called back.
European automotive manufacturers strongly promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered a cancer and may lead to asthma.
The cost of automotive companies installing equipment to compensate for diesel gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive at prices.
As the German automotive manufacturers face an investigation, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel is also accused of exaggerating these powerful automotive companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
These automotive companies are trying to avoid repeating the crowd’s disappointment, that is, hiding their use of the so-called failed device, adjusting emissions to conform to regulations during automotive tests, and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several general executives are accused in the United States, while other executives are under investigation in the Atlantic coast countries.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Pamio is an Italian, therefore not protected from extradition, and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the Volkswagen, and the German government accused Audi of installing the system to escape the European emission requirements, expanding the scope of the previously limited investigation to the United States.
Audi’s investigation may have a significant impact on the Volkswagen: luxury automotive manufacturers hold an unproportionate profit share of the Volkswagen.
A film from preparation to appearance, lasting one or two years or even a few years, can be used to.
The animated movie "Big Fish Seafood" today announced it will be released on July 8, the film takes 12 years from preparation to release!
The original author, Liu Liu Liu, 21 years old from the University of Qinghai thermal energy engineering industry, together with a good friend, Zhang Spring, founded the East Coast Day, in 2008 received a risk investment of a million dollars, launched the animated film virgin work, The Big Fish Sea Liu.
The film in the creative sample phase has been awarded numerous national and international awards, more recognised by the French Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompeii and honored as "one of the most outstanding works of art."
Due to the six-year duration from creativity to production, the film was called "God's Grave" by millions of fans expected to show up.
The Big Fish Seafood tells a fiction story that belongs to the Chinese.With the announcement of this archived film, it brings new expectations to all the audience.
“I’ve done this only for 12 years, now it’s turned from a dream to reality, I’m both nervous and excited.”
Zhang said: "Old thinking of using one fifth of the budgets of others, making the same image effect as others, the team will be crazy by me.
Dongguan, the “world factory” which once relied on material processing and large numbers of all-workers, is focusing on those high-level professionals who can lead the city to re-position.
Last week, the high-level talent activity organized by the Dongguan City Government, the first financial journalist saw that some strong local companies were taking part in talent talks.
On the most bright advertising cards under the orange red background walls, they each indicate unfavorable price codes.
Therefore, the China Television Theatre Manufacturing Industry Association decided to join the National Television Theatre Manufacturing Industry to sign an autonomous agreement.
Provence Lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is a bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
Due to continued drought and the appearance of viral insects, lavender is falling down, causing headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute of Agriculture in Provence, says: “The lavender in Provence is faced with a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant decrease in spring rainfall and a heavy rainfall in autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of the lavender.
There is also an individual smaller candlestick, a candlestick that can spread small bacteria, in very dry weather, they will appear a lot of candlestick.
The key is that the number is huge.
The elegant lavender fields, in addition to being able to attract vacationers, lavender oil is also popular in the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Zayes said, “Unlike plants that can grow many big flowers and have long sheets, we have problems with the smallest individual, poor development, lack or weakness.
Our oil content is less.
The researching solutions include taking better irrigation technologies and slowing the evaporation of soil water, spraying protective mixtures of mucus and water into plants, and developing more dry-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the film, the two main actors said they were more attracted to the story in the film.
On the 5th of September afternoon, the Warsaw City newspaper, interviewing several famous people from the sound industry, and two sound performing artists, surprisingly, they remained silent.
One is the Berlin Filmmaker, one is the upper-time youth actor, and the Psychic Crime is also the first partner of Liuvan and Lee Peak.
Mexican journalist killed
All employees of the Riodoce Weekly will usually gather on Wednesday to review their reporting plans on the violations in Sinaro, which are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and endless drug warfare.
But today, the shadow of the tragedy covers themselves, they gather together to discuss security issues.
They are told to change their daily habits, and that’s important.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more secure: whether to bring their children to the office (the office was attacked by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the black board in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the allies.
They let these journalists list the names under each column – no evidence, observation and intuition are enough.
There are suspicion of drug traffickers, politicians, entrepreneurs and journalists on the government’s lists, or Catherine, who put the reporting work in Mexico in danger.
Violence has never stopped, the nation’s corpses are widespread, with more and more journalists: according to the records of the Press Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Benia Neto’s assembly in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the Federal after attacks and threats; and so far, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last dead was their editor and source of inspiration, as well as the co-founder of Riodoce, Havel Valdiz Cadenas.
Waldiz has written many books about drug violence, and in one of them he writes: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
Everyone can feel deeply that he’s gone, even though he’s everywhere – a huge photo hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, Waldiz hanging the mid-finger with the word “Justice”; the t-shirt of the two 30-year-old journalists, Aaron Ivalah and Miriam Ramirez, also shows his smile, he’s wearing glasses or his iconic Panama T-shirt.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and multi-suchness.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the case of journalists, according to the records of the Press Protection Committee, the office only charged two persons.
Every year, many of the thousands of crimes involve drug trafficking and organized crimes, so very rarely the murderer who kills journalists can be brought to court.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting the violent incidents in Sinaro, although they have broken their hearts, although the land has been stumbled.
Ivanka said that without the killer’s information, without the extension of justice, there was no great benefit to hold security talks.
He said, “It’s stupid to waste time on such seminars.
As long as we don’t know why, you don’t believe anyone.
In the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the Riodoce office in the capital, Curiacan.
His red Toyota Carola only opened a few streets and was stopped by two men; they forced him off the car, shooting 12 shots, guessing that it was because of the newspaper’s name – translated as The Twelve River.
The robber drove his car and destroyed it nearby.
Valdis is 50 years old.
He left his wife and two older children.
Curia Khan spoke four times.
But on the topic of Valdiz, in fact, nothing except silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and withdrawn to the United States in January, Sinaro has become the country’s most bloody battlefield, and all the enemy forces are crazy.
One or more people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaro every day, and the tombs are filled with two floors of grapes that are already unusual.
Currently forgotten the state of "peace" is when only one Caterpillar controls the coastal state and its ports and the drug trafficking routes that go to the United States.
Even though Valdiz was deeply aware of the dangers of the work, Riodoce’s 60 year old co-founder and director, Ismail Bohoku, was guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believed two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, in February, Damaso Lopez published an interview, he led a Catherine group fighting with several sons of Guzman.
The report could rage the sons; the newspaper was sent to the magazine when it was bought by suspicious gang members.
The second mistake was that after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated, Valdiz was not forced to consider to leave Mexico for his safety.
Waldiz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has a major significance for Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit survived, his friends and colleagues believed he was always with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist for "Noroeste", when he joined five colleagues to foundation "Riodoce" and sold his shares for $50.
Pohoquy said, in Sinaro, “the press industry cannot be unable to deal with the issue of drugs.”
Over time, the newspaper gained a good reputation for courageous and honest reports, and sales and advertising also increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports without worrying about review, and readers like to publish newspapers that others don’t dare to report.
Riodoce was awarded the Latin American National Maria Moscapa News Award five years after its foundation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the World Press Freedom Award to honour his courage to pursue the most real Mexican drug reporting.
He said he was also afraid.
When the award was awarded by the Association for the Protection of Journalists, he said, “I want to continue living.”
Later, at the end of October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV: “In Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You must take the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist – either it is, or it’s as a fool.
I don’t want to be asked, ‘What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why don’t you speak about what’s happening?’”
All the employees of Riodoce missed Valdiz, missed him as a terminal worker, missed the friend who never missed his embrace and advice, missed the teacher who knew how to survive.
They depend on their habits.
He was often wearing the hat.
The El Guayabo bar in front of the office is always sitting on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that have caused his meteority?
His death also led them to think about how to work well and live well.
“They don’t like you bother their women and children, and they don’t like you affect their legitimate companies and the secret airports for the transport of drugs.
They all crossed their bottom line.
As a result, even at the safest times, a high level of self-examination and self-protection should beined.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell a dangerous breath, get away.
Riodoce’s editor, Andrews Verrill, said the problem is that “the breath is a feeling that will be deceived ... and then something like Havel will happen.”
He and others said the previous rules were no longer applicable to the state of Sinaro—as it is no longer applicable to the state of Tamoulipas, Veracruz, Grayro and other states, where the trade routes are profitable, while the institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smoke.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the rooms in which Riodoce staff participated in security training, the phone was suddenly banned; a few days ago, spy software that was allegedly sold to the government in Mexico had been used to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen walked cold under the trees and escaped from a height of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class district of Kuriacan.
Some journalists are half-shaking and joking that they don’t know if these policemen belong to just 50% of what the governor himself said.
The journalists have gone to the mountains for a few months, where the drug trafficking group is under the control of the actual existence.
This week’s Riodoce mainly three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinaro, Giulio Cesar Chavez.
The government’s funds of the Governor’s home,
As well as the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Curiacan, the restaurant is only one district from the prosecutor's office.
The official does not publish any information about the kidnapped objects and the kidnapping process, so it is necessary to be careful and cautious when writing what the city knows: that is the restaurant where the drug trader and officials love.
A journalist from the public archives learned that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician of the ruling Party Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political classes throughout the past age.
Recently, several Governors of the Revolutionary Party have been charged with corruption in several highly appreciated cases.
Viralir asked the journalists to write what happened in the place before the incident, including a son of the Mexican drug number one, Tencent Guzman, who escaped from a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdiz's columns to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping incident.
The 46-year-old Viralyr, because of his thin body, was called “slow,” he said, “In the past, we’ve already known what’s happened.
Now all our sources of information communication channels are cut off.
The Waldiz's office is now used to store the labels and labels of the protesters to kill journalists, as the employees have become the way they never wanted to be: represent media activists.
The next morning, the journalist, Miriam Ramires, took a sign out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a demonstration related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after being killed in Valdiz in western Michigan, Ken.
Officials found a burned body and said it was his body according to DNA tests.
Over the whole country, journalists became more straightforward, they organized protests, painting the word "save the media" on the walks and buildings.
On that day, CEO Bohoku was not in Washington, and he was struggling to extend justice for the Valdiz case and struggle for international support.
On the day after Valdiz was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaro, Ramires complained about the official assassination news and killed them because they told the facts.
Since her anger has influenced her objectivity, she also asked to resign from the post of reporting government affairs.
Waldiz has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “incircumcised” by organized crime, corrupt government officials, and uninterested society.
In his previous book ‘Drug News Industry’, he writes that journalists are not only damaged by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces that are associated with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 accused more than half of the press attacks last year of police and public officials.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they make you die only to make you silent.”
Of course, these murders are uncold.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias died on the northern border of Tamoulipas.
Behind her body, there was a letter allegedly signed by Zetascarter: “I’m coming for my report.”
Her headache was cut down and a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to her.
After Miroslav Brech was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue, the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke about drugs with a headline of news, entitled “What do you want to get from us?”
Some journalists fled their homeland, or even left the country.
This is a difficult decision.
It’s hard to find a job in the evacuation, and they still need to be careful in the streets and alert at dangers.
Sometimes they will be arrested, allegedly killed in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa in a Mexican city with four women, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who remain behind the scene to continue working, this is a daily step of high risk decision making.
Ivanah once wanted to be a poet, and he acknowledged that reports of drug trafficking made him scared.
He said, “Mexico is becoming hell, so I’m a journalist.”
Last Friday's midnight, the latest edition of the newspaper has been printed, and the editors of Riodoce are sitting on the walks outside the office and drinking beer, and suddenly their cell phones sound.
A series of shootings occurred by the hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatlan, confirming the deaths of 19 people.
The war continues to upgrade, as a series of Catherine information found in the area predicts.
They just uploaded the news to the Riodoce website via their mobile phone on the road.
The title of the next day had to be changed.
Warning screams sounded in the vicinity – a mass shooting occurred in the area.
Bohoquee looked at the guard who stood there and saw if they were alert.
If they were a bit afraid, then they didn’t show up either.
The founder of the newspaper has died, and on his large portrait, his mid-finger points to the whole of the city of Sinaro, the whole staff of Riodoce followed his pace.
“How can you even want to close? the same day when Havel was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report.”
China’s self-driving tourism 2020 market size or exceeds trillion yuan
In the big background of the upgrade of consumption and freedom of movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular by consumers.
But at the same time, the trillion-scale self-driving market is also facing double challenges.
In the big background of the upgrading of consumption and freedom of movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and the popularity of more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the trillion-scale self-driving market also faces double challenges, on the one hand the development of the self-driving industry is unproportionate with the market demand, self-driving clubs and travel agencies such as self-driving organizers are faced with profitable difficulties; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving are still in the primary stage.
It accounts for 60% of the total domestic tour, and the market size is expected to exceed a trillion.
In 2016, domestic tourism was 44.4 million people throughout the year, self-driving tourism accounts for approximately 60% of the total domestic tourism population, and by 2020 the size of self-driving tourism market is expected to exceed a billion.
According to the statistics of the China Tourism Ship Association on the number of self-driving travellers, the number of travellers has continued to grow in the past five years, and the number of travellers represents the percentage of domestic tourists stable in more than half.
At the same time, regional and national levels showed more attention and support to the emerging area of self-driving tourism, and in 2016 to 2017, the policy regulations related to self-driving cars, residential cars and camp tourism were intense.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Bureau and the National Sports General Bureau, jointly published the Automotive Self-Driving Sports Camp Development Plan; in the same month, the Development Commission, the Ministry of Finance and 14 departments jointly published the “Promoting Rural Tourism Development Quality Upgrade Action Program (2017), self-Driving Tour was mentioned.
The establishment of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving club profits are low, the whole industry chain is key.
Although the domestic self-driving tour market has a huge potential and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving tour industry is still in the initial stage.
According to the 2016-2017 China Self-Driving Tour Annual Development Report, the domestic Self-Driving Tour Clubs, Automotive Clubs, Automotive Friends Association, etc. reached thousands, but the percentage of tourists self-help arranging self-driving excursions occupies the majority, and the percentage of tourists who participate in Automotive Friends Association, Self-Driving Clubs and other institutions is only about 15%.
At the same time, independently developing and developing self-driving travel products online tourism companies and traditional travel agencies are also countless, many online tourism platforms are sold only by some suppliers of self-driving travel products, some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
From organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects of " eating, living, walking, swimming, shopping, entertainment", a high degree of fragmentation, upward supply chain weight, tourist consumption is a lot of random.
Lee Chongji, founder and CEO of Beijing Rainbow Automobile Club, believes that the self-driving club is essentially similar to the travel agency, the early main profit model is mainly underline activity, the core point is self-driving line products and lead service.
But today in the self-driving sector, the line-up products are seriously homogeneized, the level of leadership service is unreliable, and the self-driving club is facing the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving itself is not an independent industry, but with its self-driving transfer characteristics forms a cross-geographic, industrial ecosphere, forming a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tour industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, the theme "self-driving tour +" and the IP of self-driving tour products should be developed.
The landscape is not just the road, the car camp should not only meet the accommodation.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the development of the basics of self-driving is also more primary.
Li Chongji pointed out that the tourist landscape is not just a road, but needs to combine the transport and tourism elements in it, but the road repair and tourism itself are two departments to be responsible, the transport sector increases the tourism elements, and also remains in the construction of toilets, consultancy centers, advertising bars and other facilities, the combination with tourism is not high.
Comparing the famous self-driving route "American 66 Road", the construction experience is worth considering.
The landscape design is no longer the fastest route between the destination to the destination, but it follows the design concept of "experience of driving fun", providing tourists with self-driving the best enjoyment of appreciating the landscape along the road; the landscape can combine the point shape and face tourist landscape, both retains the historic value and cultural value of the ecological tourism resources along the line, and can also organize various thematic activities to enhance the participation of tourists and the recreation experience, and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is also an important accessory facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists known by the New York Times, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps prefer to infrastructure, only to meet the food, not high, the product is single, not able to meet the needs of self-driving that contains many elements.
There are people in the industry who do not want to disclose the name said that many of the companies that did the camp in the previous years were to take the land, after taking the land, the subsequent supported infrastructure construction and services did not follow, the operating situation many were losses, and without subsequent funds injected, it was difficult to make some corresponding supported products.
Consumer Group
According to the data published in 2017 by the China Tourism Ship Association, from age to age, self-driving tour groups are concentrated in the ages of 21-40, which are mainly between the ages of 31 and 40, this part of the population has a certain economic basis, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for family tour customers.
According to the accommodation survey, self-driving tourists prefer relatively more non-standard accommodation.
From the type of self-driving, self-driving is the main type of self-driving, representing 84.32%.
Exit self-driving is a desire for many, but the proportion is smaller.
At the same time, with the increase in consumption demand, tourists who in the past liked self-driving "course attractions" began to transform the idea, no longer the self-driving process of "driving out of the car, sleeping on the car", but more focus on the experience and process of travel.
The dinosaurs use the disguise to escape the enemy.
At first glance, it is terrible, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers have published the first results of the study of the incredible, rhinoceros-sized biological fossils discovered by Canadian miners, indicating that the fossil is well preserved, and therefore experts call it "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world".
This fibre is preserved very well, and can even determine the color of its shade skin is red brown, which indicates it has had some "problematic experience".
The journal Contemporary Biology describes it as "the best preserved dinosaurs ever discovered, and one of the best dinosaur samples in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered dragon species that lived in the middle of the White Age 1.1 billion to 1.12 billion years ago.
Its preservation was extremely good and shocked the researchers who described it as “really spectacular.”
According to the National Geographic magazine, the herbicide dinosaur fibre is the best preserved dinosaur fibre ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil during the mining at the Sencore Millennium Mining near McMuriburg, north of Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he met something that seemed not big as the rocks around him, so he decided to look carefully.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Terrier Ancient Museum in Canada.
The researchers took six years to reveal the real face of the beast hidden within 2,500 pounds (1100 kg) of soil.
After so hard work, the final results are now announced.
“If you look at it, you’ll almost believe it’s asleep,” says the Royal Threeer Museum scientist and first author Caleb Brown.
It will be one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaur patterns in the history of science - Monna Lisa in the dinosaur world.
Through the study of their skin, the researchers found that this herbicide organism, although wearing armor, like a walking tank, is likely to be a major threat from meat dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs with heavy arms use red and white clothes to escape the hunters, and use the hiding technique known as “anti-shadow” which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way it can better integrate with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, which indicates it is eaten by larger dinosaurs.
This 1.1 billion-year-old creature belongs to the Thunderbird family, which for the first time became the head news in May and is currently exhibited at the Royal Thunderbird Ancient Biology Museum.
As one of the team members, the museum technician Mark Mitchell took 7,000 hours to thoroughly uncover the beast, and the researchers are now researching it and naming it "Borealopelta markmitchelli".
The samples were well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as an international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of the shapes and shapes on his body.
They discovered the "anti-blind" technique, which is a common way of defense in the animal community, meaning that the back of the organism is darker than the color of its side.
Although the "anti-shadow" technique is common, the findings are surprising, as the dinosaur's body shape is far greater than the existing animals using anti-shadow.
This dinosaur faces the pressure of being hunted by meat-food dinosaurs, and thus evolves in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the barrier and use it as a means of survival.
However, the majority of the existing anti-shadow animals, such as rabbits, zombies, and so on, are as small and vulnerable as the hunt, which indicates that the organism is faced with real survival pressure.
“Great heavy-armed dinosaurs suffered crazy catch shows how dangerous white-day meat dinosaurs are,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its pipe also shows that the dinosaur's skin is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to investigate the life traces of the organism, including the stomach content it retains to find the food that is finally eaten.
They believe that the dinosaurs fall into the river when they die and then go into the ocean and eventually fall into the bottom of the sea.
At that time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as today in the south of Florida, with rivers and oceans likely to be deeper inside than now.
Brown said, “This dragon is truly amazing, because it is completely covered by the shaped shaped skin, and, so far, it is kept in the shaped space, so that its original shape can be preserved.”
“Therefore, the form of this organism is almost the same as the form of the White Age.
You don’t need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you’ll almost believe it is sleeping.
The White Age was the time when large animal-foot dinosaurs walked on Earth.
Although the Hague Dragon is the king of the dinosaurs, it appears only millions of years after the Hague dinosaurs. the Hague dinosaurs may have been caught by some of the ancestors of the Hague.
They include a tall dragon, a giant beast weighing up to 6 tons and lengthing 38 feet (11.5 m).
The latest research found that scientists in the magazine Contemporary Biology believed that the dragon was thrown into the sea after death and then formed a mummy in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink discovered the creature in a millennium mining near McMuriburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, with the skin and armor in the area from the nose to the ass and so on.
This biology is an average length of about 18 feet (5 m), weighing up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20 inches long corners out of the shoulder.
The researchers believe that these herbicide dinosaurs are currently active in the western region of Canada, after which the rivers of the flood exploded into the ocean.
However, this dinosaur was buried under the sea and made it possible to be fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this special sample are preserved very well, making the remaining skin still covered with scratched spots on the dinosaur's headaches.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geography magazine, this level of preservation is very rare, just like the middle color.
The more I look, the more I feel it is incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered over the arms that are scattered on the dinosaur's chest.
Its front right arm is on its side, with five fingers spread upwards.
I can get it out statistics.
The journalists learned that the addition of natural or plant sources of algae acids, corrosive acids and amino acids add-effect carriers to the urine production process can make modificative add-effects to traditional urine, the formation of algae acid urine, zinc corrosive urine, hydrogen urine nitrogen use rate increased by 5-10 percent points compared to ordinary urine.
Environmentally friendly, the growth potential of crops is clear, especially large particles of urine are more BB fat quality raw materials.
The total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security association plan ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 850,000 soldiers from the army and police will fight together, including 20,000 soldiers and 650,000 policemen.
The majority of the soldiers will be responsible for defending the Olympic stadium, while the additional 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrolled other places in the city, including the metro, buses and streets.
About 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to the responsibility for the four major Olympics in Rio, they are also responsible for patroling on the airport as well as on the main roads that connect the airport and the Olympics.
The introduction of the assessment mechanisms in the service industry has long been not a new thing, to make the assessment mechanisms effective, it is important to make regulations more effective and not flow into form.
How radicals learn to answer this question: “Who’s the street?”
On August 9, 2014, Brettani Ferrer was intimidated.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man was sitting on his rental bed and browsing Facebook on his phone.
She accidentally found a high school student post.
“The police have just killed a 18-year-old boy and the child is still lying on the street.”
She found that no one else posted the message on the feedback, and she was confused. she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user continues to push her to a dynamic newspaper.
Michael Brown, a 18-year-old black man without weapons, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body leaving on the street and his body leaving on the street for four hours.
“I’m crazy,” Ferrer thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put her phone down until she opened Twitter again that night, reading a tweet about the crowd gathered on Campfield Avenue.
There were a police video and a photograph of people screaming, and a photo of someone who claimed to be Brown’s father, which was written: “Ferguson’s police just killed my handless son!”
She saw a news from the scene, where a police officer standed in front of a group of protesters with a cattle dog.
She said, in another video, another police man raised his gun and cried, “I’m going to kill you all...
“It’s not normal,” Ferrer said when he remembered.
“It’s not a typical murder that we’re used to, which can be called a typical murder.”
At that moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and crying.
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided to travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of a new documentary film “Who’s the Street?” released in the cinema on August 11.
This is a story about the people living in this community, filled with streets requiring answers, telling the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance.
When Ferrer and his daughter (wrapped in a flower dress, with a crown accessory) were driving to Ferguson, the two discussed the topics they had discussed many times before that morning—“On the experience of the black and the situation of the black.”
“Do you remember when I taught you when the black people had to fight for their faith?” she recalled.
“We’re going to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, that’s wrong.
I had to take her with me,” said Ferrer later.
“What’s happening today is the orgasm of all things in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this thing.
She needs not only to develop well in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of the black experience and the situation of the black, and to understand what we need to do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even if I was lucky to offer her a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was nothing different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I’m hurt her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first station located on a site in front of the South Florida San Route Police Station. The radicals waited until the result of the police officer Darren Wilson was eventually unacceptable, the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter are in contact with a local business owner who makes a bag lunch.
They prepared the pockets and were responsible for giving the pockets to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
She said, “My radicalism completely changed after August 9, when she studied at St. Louis University of Missouri, where she was the chairman of the Minority Nurses Association, focusing on the issue of food justice and health gap in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
That’s how it all came.
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-regisseur Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
Foleyan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Faller “just wanted to record” what happened.
Farrell's head comes up with a question: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion arises from many of these cases: people – usually white people – enter a community to benefit from their suffering and perseverance.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that people born in Ferguson don’t focus their voice, and we want to do it in different ways.
Foleyan has been in contact with joint director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist famous for its radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join the project team "Who's the Street?" together with six other local people, who were unleashed over the years after Brown was shot.
“This documentary is not someone talking for us or talking to us, this is our speech,” David said.
“I’m most concerned about how these characters are presented, because this is the way I’m presented.”
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show the movement “not about the Redemptor’s leaders, but about community cohesion,” Foleyan said – the fact is that she is the most open among film participants.
The result, “Who’s the Street?” surprisingly recorded Ferrer’s personal life, such as falling in love, walking in marriage.
“I feel naked,” Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that doing this work and humanizing the black people must have a certain degree of vulnerability.”
Furthermore, Ferrer’s story reaffirms and re-locates the role of black-colored women in a wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 black teen Trevoron Martin shooting – were recognized as cool.
“The black and cool women in the leadership generally supported this movement,” Ferrer said, “this is because we are fighting on several fronts.
A black woman must endure all this.
Foleyan agreed and mentioned that "this sport really got the support of black women and many black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. however, she insisted that "this is not a certain action against things."
“She’s the one who inspires this energy,” she says.
“While she’s on the front, it’s not a coincidence because in these crossroads of life, as a black woman, you have a lot of things to do.
Through the screen you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news cameras have long disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police still exist.
For attempting to block highways during a demonstration, Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years in prison.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "A disruption"
Nevertheless, since she walked to Ferguson Street three years ago, she has continued to adhere to the sacred song she strives to remember.
“We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We are no longer lost, except the lock on our body.
In fact, a decade ago, online translation services were already available, and in fact, a very early time ago, the argument on “Machines are about to replace humans to translate” was untouched.
Similarities: Artists Use Chelsea Manning's DNA Creation Portraits
In the center of the exhibition at the New York Friedman Gallery there are several faces: white, black, and brown, with almost unseen similarities between each faces, and these faces are linked by a line of the roof.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Duwey-Hagborg (Dewey-Hagborg) using Chelsea Manin sent to her face necklace and hair fractures.
Manin sent hair fragments from the Leuven Wusberg prison for the disclosure of a secret diplomatic telegram through the WikiLeaks website, the former intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2, with the title “Samses”.
This was the result of two years of communication between Duwey Hagberg and Manin, Duwey Hagberg combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, while Manin was a famous different visionary who had been in prison and completed a transgender surgery in prison.
Through the algorithmic analysis of Manin's DNA, he created 30 portraits of "very likely appearance."Hitcher Duwey Hubberg made a sharp and slightly miserable comment on his comment on both the pluralism of the DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manin's birth name was Bradley Edward, who publicly acknowledged himself as a woman in his adolescence and was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six spy law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In the prison, her image was suppressed, only one photo, with a particle-sensitive black and white self-photography, seemed clearly anxious, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing the golden shirt.
In 2015, Heather Duwey Hubble made a huge success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used the medium court evidence from cigarette and garlic to extract the DNA from the rubbish to create a possibly similar 3D portrait of characters.
That was an email she just received from the Paper magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manin in prison and need a portrait,” Heather Duwey Hubbard told the media at the opening ceremony.
At that time, Chelsea Manin could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
Thus, the artist and her imprisoned Mouse became unlikely friends, and in two years they exchanged many letters with each other.
They even created a comic book, The Depressed Face Picture, painted by Shoili Kanungo. the comic book predicts that the president in the future will allow the privileges to Manin, and she will be able to see the exhibition in prison.
And just a few days after the book was published, Obama asked for her release, which was a coincidence when Manin spent the seventh year in the Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, this exhibition has another deep sense: because of the contemporary America, the Trump administration continuously declares war on government scammers and transgender soldiers, while looking for new ways, which can be hacked on Twitter, to nakedly trigger divisions, and this exhibition is precisely to address such divisions.
When asked about all these special moments, Heather Duwey Hubberg said, “Everything happens has a reason.”
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manin's super-grand signature is below (the "i" in the name to be painted with a heart) calling for the end of "gender, gender and culture-based party struggle as a puzzle."
On the opposite wall there is a DNA sequence of her particles, with the symbols Cs, Gs and As written with a curved pencil.
By containing 200 letters (or Nucleic Acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duwey Hubbard wants to express at least in the physical structure by drawing these surprisingly similar portraits.
“I want people to get rid of this difficulty, our genome doesn’t care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is,” says Heather Duwey Hubbard, who also shows his 2007 video work ‘Fake Memories’.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them.
The last work in the exhibition, in one room, comes from a page of the front illustration in the middle of the novel.
Showing a flowered, diamond-shaped manin under the US soldiers' handheld amplifier.
“When they stop your speech, they win,” it was written on the wall.
“So don’t silence your mouth.
“The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” the artist from Philadelphia said.
“I’m just afraid, I’m still going to say.”
Manin has not seen the exhibition personally, as it was predicted in the cartoon, but when she did it, she would get joy by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the exhibition center.
It’s also intended, and like all the items in the exhibition, it’s reached the height of her genetic single-group information written with a pen (5.2 feet, Manin’s height).
“In the past, I hanged them on the wall, but I want them to feel like a group of people,” Douglas Hagberg said when he spoke about the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters who follow Chelsea, just as people protested to release her.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff are searched for murder
Police said a man was found deadly wounded in a luxury apartment in Chicago and a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee were then searched and are currently searching for suspects across the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wendem Lessem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were sentenced to a non-guarded murder order for suspicion of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durant.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell Durantone died from multiple scratches.
A community warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after they received a phone call and found the victim had several cramps in his body.
The police said Cornell Durango was killed at the scene, the detective is investigating his murder, and the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lessem has been a deputy professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Kubec, Deputy Director of Campus Relations, said in an email statement that Lessem has now been dismissed and has been prohibited from entering the Northwest University campus.
Kobech said, “Now it’s a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating, the Northwestern University is actively collaborating with the investigation work.”
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University of Oxford's Samurai College said in an email statement: "We have always been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the U.S. investigation agency at any time.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he could give up.
The chief contact officer of the Chicago Police Bureau, Anthony Gullemi, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to give up to the authorities.
Gorelmi said, "The police have an estimated idea about their location, and we are trying to locate possible places."
Gorelli said local, regional and national authorities are doing their best to help find suspects.
Gorelmi said the police had received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager and he had just received a secret message saying the 1008 apartment had occurred.
Police said the situation was terrible at that time.
Gorelmi said it is still unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said, according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were at the time in the building.
“We believe that Professor Lessem and the victim have a certain relationship,” Gullemi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents saying: "The police are currently investigating the victim's incident timeline and background, investigating various motives, including possible domestic events.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, “We will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said the implementation of the remaining standard of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore the right to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will not take a long time.
“The implementation of the route map standards has been implemented in a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to work with UKAD to plan and test.
The WADA route map has been updated in this regard,” Mottko said on Thursday.
Vice-Premier Mottko made the above statements when commenting on the World Anti-Doping Organization’s Router Map’s second part “Compliance with the Rules”, which defines the standards for the restoration of RUSADA’s rights and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mottko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause concerns to Russia.
He added, “Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the results of an investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on the WADA on the Russian state’s support for the use of doping in its own sports.
He said: “We’re investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there’s no national plan behind it, we don’t admit that there’s nothing.
The words of Muttko responded to the words of the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee, Vitaly Smirnov.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency had existed in the past at a visit to the Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added: "We have said many times in various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov said.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA’s right to conduct doping tests in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri, during a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, said RUSADA is “going in the right direction” and trying to restore its rights.

President of the Croatian Football Association, Davo-Suk, said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is meaningful for Croatian football, and the bonus numbers for the China Cup are very large.
You don’t need to buy more than 8,000 products.
At the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that so far, China has entered into force 15 free trade agreements, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 import products with zero tariffs.
At the same time, the imports of cosmetics, Icelandic sandwiches, Chilean red wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN ... you need these products not to cost a lot more.
Currently, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 import products with zero tariffs.
With agricultural products for example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different land produced, quality and cheaply in four seasons of the year.
For example, ASEAN’s grenade, limonate, and frog fruit, the import duties are reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
Iceland's Customs Customs are reduced from 10% to 12% to zero;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import duties decreased from 14% to 30% to zero;
New Zealand’s milk and milk products have a significant reduction in taxes.
Take industrial goods as an example, for example, Switzerland's imports of some cosmetics have been reduced to zero;
Some clock import tariffs have been reduced by 50%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years later.
South Korea's tariffs on the import of products such as electrical refrigerators, electrical pot, massage machines, and cosmetics have been reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years.
There are also significant reductions on consumer electronic products.
At the same time, zero tariff products under the Free Trade Zone also include the intermediate products and raw materials needed for many domestic terminal consumer goods manufacture, and in a certain degree promoted the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that one-third of China’s total imports can enjoy the treatment of the Free Trade Agreement preferential tariffs, most of which are terminal consumer goods, bringing real benefits to consumers.
Reducing tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted tariffs on imports of some consumer goods, further reducing tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering food, health goods, drugs, daily goods, clothing shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily goods and other consumer goods, including 187 eight-bit tax numbers.
The average tax rate for these consumption goods will be reduced from 17.3% straight to 7.7%, almost being “blocked”!
As of January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export duties.
Customs on imports of some cosmetic products, such as lips powder, eye shadow, perfume, are reduced from 10% to 5%;
After the reduction of tariffs, it means that consumers don’t need to buy, and no longer need to go out of the country to buy the foreign products they like.

Foreign News: In the end of the year, the U.S. shopping regulations differ great, shopping returns need to be cautious
News on 29 December.
According to the U.S. World Daily, Christmas has just passed and it is coming back.
According to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
Additionally, there are readers who are several times cheating, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on an informal website.
In general, large shopping companies have a formal and reasonable return procedure, but you should be careful when buying gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small stores.
Mrs. Hu of Lorraine on 1 December, local time, in an online store specialized in the sale of printed shorts, spent more than $60 (USD, below) to buy a shirt, the result has not yet been sent.
She sent an email to the customer and didn’t get any answers.
Another internet user exploded, traveling to the United States last year, buying a phone from a third-party seller, sending after finding that there was a box of rubber rubber.
If you know that you are deceived, you can apply for a refund to the website and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website’s refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Northern California Chinese resident, Mr. King, said he had two times purchased an emergency delivery service on a website, one emergency service for $4, but none had been delivered in time.
Request for a refund and no response was received.
Large shops or shops have a better return policy.
The majority of Macy’s goods are returned in full within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain as "originally" and require a purchase certificate such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
If there is no certificate, the customer can also get a shop point, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target for general goods usually has a 90 day return period, and electronic goods usually 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 is extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30 day return period begins on December 25, which is to be returned before January 25, 2018.
Excellent shopping experience, a new era of shopping development comes.
More than a decade ago, China in general was still on the seller market, people had limited choices and demand was also limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved the transition from the seller market to the buyer market, today the consumer taste has become more narrow, they are no longer satisfied with the simple "one hand pay a hand delivery" shopping behavior.
Thus, how to give consumers an incredible shopping experience is the next competition point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in the business sector is the most significant.
See how urban builders focus on shopping experience.
There are no two completely the same leaves in the world, and there are no two completely the same shopping centers, and a famous shopping center must have its own features.
For example, the world-famous Canyon shopping center in Turkey, its unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, so called the Harmonious Canyon, walking in the 200 meters long walk of the Central Canyon as if it was placed within the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the Canyon-style design, in the center of the shopping center there is also a large round-shaped stage, with a unique appearance, which often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists can walk on each floor to look at the activities carried out in the "Canyon" and have the effect of shifting the landscape.
And in the country, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, which is known as China’s first forest-style walking consumer site, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales perfectly.
7000 square meters of green square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square.
Going into the Forest Moore, like a cautiously falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's excursion, climbing along the trees will surround the building, the grass and the brick, bringing people into a living and vibrant forest.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake built the Shandong Water Commercial Circle, planning the business, plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, more than 100 international top-selling brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, to become a business center of service industry gathering, theme characteristics clear.
In addition, the Shenzhen Water Trade Center also integrates the ecology into the building, all-to-people public transport, fashion shopping, life services, food, entertainment, education, sports together, bringing the consumers an extremely shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "shore water culture", integrating shopping with water entertainment and leisure perfectly.
In sum, it can be found that at the moment, some housing companies have already understood the discovery track of this new urban business, and industry officials say that this consumer experience centered, how to combine shopping with experience consumer model will also be the main trend of future urban development.
Today’s business is not only a concentration of goods, it is more a complex place for the integration of art culture and creative themes, it also carries the responsibility of people to the urban residence.
Therefore, while meeting the consumer's food and drink and fun shopping one-stop material needs, maximizing the cultural art multi-level spiritual needs, playing the habitable needs, is necessarily the high point of the future development of the business sector.
In Chongqing, Nanjing's north coast of Jiangsu, located in Jiangsu, close to the viewing bridge, distinguished world business excellence, international giant companies right round, first-class brands gathered together, close to international fashion.
There is a glory, a glory, a glory.
Eastern Chongqing has a better shopping environment, Eastern Chongqing is close to the Southern Chongqing shopping district, exclusive in the west and even the country’s leading four-layer stereo transport system, improving shopping comfort.
In addition, the garden greening and landscape upgrades of the two walking streets of the Wanda Square and Wanda Square have been carried out, planting about 300 pieces of joom, transforming the landscape of 40,000 square meters, improving the image of the Southern Square business circle;
And Long Lake Chongqing Lake 1, close to Chongqing's first low-tensity coastal trade circle - Chongqing Water Trade Circle, is surrounded by nine parks, commercial streets are low-tensity, openness is high, making people more willing to stay, stay, slowly enjoy the fun of shopping when shopping, rather than by the back of the people flowed fast and busy toward, really achieved the "walking shopping".
Today’s business competition will only become more and more intense, how to kill a bloodstream in the homogeneous serious markets, to gain the reputation of the “shopping holy place” in the minds of future consumers, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
Only with a differentiating strategy is far not enough, only those who really rightly put the consumer in mind, the consumer is urgent, the consumer wants what the consumer thinks, the consumer is offering an extremely simple and simple shopping experience developers can laugh in the storm coming market.
Of course, to the end I think the most happy or Chongqing people, having such a good shopping experience and business circles, placed 10 years ago no one could imagine the prosperity of today.
Facts: Consumerism Festival Covers Real Environmental Prices
162.2 billion yuan, which is the transaction amount of the consumption of the users of the 24 hours of the "Global Festival of the Twelve Twelve" on November 11, 2017.

These consumptions will bring 8.12 billion logistics orders.
Whether it’s the Skycat online shopping platform or the payment platform, all belong to the Ma Yun’s Ali Group.
A decade ago, no one would imagine that the 11th November single youth from the self-righteous creation of the "Light Hockey Festival" subcultural will be collected by e-commerce, becoming today's phenomenal "Double 11" shopping festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba first used the “Light Hockey Festival Grand Promotion” marketing headline: No one talks about love with you, then “single dogs” come online shopping.
The outcome is surprising, that day, the trade amount of Tomb Raider (the former of "Tomb Raider") passed 52 million, 10 times the daily trade amount at that time.

Liu Hua, director of the Green Peace East Asia Branch pollution prevention project, told China and foreign dialogue that this year the order amount of "Double 11" will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The National Post Office published a report in 2016, indicating the 2015 “Double 11” period (November 11-16), the rapid volume of about 7.8 million pieces, using more than 3 billion tissue bags, 99.2 billion packaging boxes, 169.85 billion meters of tape, tape length can turn around Earth’s equation 425 rounds.
And this year, the National Postal Bureau expects the "Double 11" fast-party business volume to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
The manager of a waste burning center in Beijing, Wangz, told the Xinhua Agency that the daily entry of the “Double 11” is more than 2,000 tons, and also exceeds the processing capacity of the burning station.
The broadcasting company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the broadcasting industry is not to be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, "Double 11" previously launched recyclable re-use plastic fast shipping boxes, recyclable shopping pockets and waste pockets cycle packaging pockets and so on, but troubled consumers are not highly accepted.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.
This microblog has collected more than 68,000 “thanks”.
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payment warfare launched in Germany is unexpected.
MICROSOFT payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position has not changed – the Chinese, this is also globalization?
Where there is payment, there must be a microscope payment.
In accordance with the agreement with the German e-payment service company Wirecard, Microsoft Payments officially started landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually arranged traders across Europe.
The two “Old Country” foreign meetings take place in Europe.
Ever since, payments and microscope payments have been a high song on the way of globalization.
For China’s way of globalization of mobile payments, Ery consulted China’s third-party mobile payments industry research report 2017 summarized in two ways: one is through strategic investments, experience output, share and support of domestic mobile payments enterprises abroad.
Second, through Chinese tourists abroad consumption behavior, promoting mobile payment services to foreign traders, thereby changing the awareness and acceptance of foreign domestic mobile payments to China.
Indeed, the Chinese have to do it.
China's economy is growing rapidly, along with a large population base, and the expenditure of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also determined that this time China’s mobile payment warfare launched in Germany is unexpected.
Microscope payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position of winning has not changed – or the Chinese, is this globalization?
The more innovative investigation is whether China’s mobile payments can expand in the mainland of Europe?
Germany as an example.
The Magic of New Retail.
Chen Zheng, Yang Keqiang: Amazon announced the entry into the world’s top ten retailers, bookstores and food stores, whether the time or the motivation are worth the taste.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle and then opened two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its shops in New York and plans to have at least eight shops by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced its own Amazon Go testing operation, customers to the store don’t need to arrange, don’t need to pay the bill, enter the code, take the desired goods away, the purchase amount will automatically be discounted from the customer’s Amazon account.
For Amazon, sudden movement on physical stores in recent years is a very unexpected thing.
Since in his 2007 Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon will not easily open a real store unless it meets the following four conditions:
We must be confident that this new opportunity will make the shareholders’ investment rewardable;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is significant for the whole company;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be confident in this market that we have enough resources to make a customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and food stores are the most stumbling classifications among the two physical retail stores, and the first rival to fall after Amazon's rise.
Amazon announces its entrance to the two physical markets when it comes to the world’s top ten retailers, and it’s worth the moment or motivation.
Is Amazon’s practice contrary to the guarantees in shareholders’ letters?
The other end of the Earth also heard a similar sound: On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou-Hungzhou Congress, Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun gave a theme speech.
He said: “From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the claim of ‘e-commerce’.
The epoch of pure e-commerce will soon end, the next decade or twenty years will be without e-commerce, replaced by ‘new retail’.
The line-up and logistics will be combined together to produce new retail sales.
For a time, the three words "new retail" were as magical, often hanged by the people of the industry on the mouth.
What does “new retail” mean?
If it’s just an indicator on line combined with the underline, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest eCommerce traders and estimated that the total sales of eCommerce were about $200 billion, with the largest 25 more than $159 billion.
Of these 25 companies, 18 are traditional online retailers (such as Messi, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have only started operating in the last five years.
And Alibaba Group invests 28.3 billion yuan in Suning Cloud traders, as well.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full channel retail system that covers real stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is “new retail” more a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, then what’s the difference between the concept of the whole channel and the “new retail”?
Per, the key to the question is not whether online and underline will not be integrated, but how to integrate.
Looking back to the retail industry over the past 20 years, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of early decrease retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
Depending on these two pain points, eCommerce transferred very high standardized products, such as books and CDs, from underline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce extends its touch to other categories and begins to improve efficiency.
In Alibaba’s words, CEO Zhang Wang said, “Using the idea and technology of the Internet to complete the reform and upgrade of the existing approximately 30 trillion social retailers, making the increasing consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively satisfied, making the entire process of goods production, circulation, services more efficient due to the widespread use of the Internet and big data.”
Therefore, the way of e-commerce, is the way of a surface light asset, the real weight asset.
“Light” means fixed assets, staff configuration, management processes and other burdens are not large in the traditional retail industry; “weight” means the need for huge investments in logistics, storage, etc.
Changes in logistics methods guarantee high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government network, the Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Li Keqiang, headed the meeting of the Council of Ministers on April 28, the meeting believed that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important initiative for stable growth and restructuring.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should urgently draw up specific plans on the basis of scientific assessment.

On January 18, Alibaba held the e-commerce deforestation summit in Chongqing, announcing to promote precise deforestation and rural revival by exploring the new "Internet + deforestation" model.
This is after presenting a rural strategy, launching a rural tobacco project, launching a platform for agriculture and poverty reduction, and establishing the Alibaba Fund for poverty reduction, Ali again “coded” against poverty reduction.
The fight against poverty is one of China’s most important national strategies.
The complete elimination of poverty has never been achieved in China over the past thousands of years.
The e-commerce reduction of poverty is a new round of innovation in the development of poverty reduction and is an important step forward to achieving accurate poverty reduction and accurate poverty reduction.
The center highlighted and pointed out that it can play the role of the Internet in helping to push off poverty, promoting accurate poverty reduction, accurate poverty reduction, and allowing agricultural products to go out of the countryside through the internet.
As a result, Ali has already presented a rural strategy in 2014, with big data cloud computing and globalization and ranked Ali as the three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Tomb Raider (Tomb Raider) project, recruiting "Tomb Raider 2" in rural areas, leading farmers to get rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali cooperated with the trade department to build a channel for rising agriculture and reducing poverty, which currently connects 13 provinces in the country and 120 counties in poverty at national level.
There are 2118 villages in the Ali Platform.
Of these, 400 appear in the province of poverty, and 33 appear in 13 countries of poverty.
In 2017, on the Alibaba China retail platform, the sales of the country’s Tomb Raider Village reached 120 billion yuan.
In the face of the country’s strategy to fight against poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovation capabilities of the Ali economies to get out a new way to fight against poverty.
Among them, the village is the main carrier platform for Ali eCommerce to get rid of poverty, and passes through a new link to the internet for direct sales to get rid of poverty.
In the field of cultivation, the village and myrtle gold clothes jointly implement agricultural equipment and small loan support.
In 2017, 795 of the 832 counties in poverty at the national level were served, providing easy payments, credit and other services.
Fresh Birds solve storage and logistics, Fresh Birds are responsible for sales, Ali Cloud’s big data is directing agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The e-commerce development of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali opened an e-commerce programme through the Tomb Raider University, teaching farmers standardized, qualityized and scaled methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of "lowering poverty + supporting mind" to enable farmers to sustainably get rid of poverty.
These courses have covered approximately 92% of the national-level poverty districts.
And the idea of “public benefit mentality, business means” can also ensure that Ali does “real poverty relief” when relieving poverty.
Alibaba’s chairman Ma Yun said that the elimination of poverty should be divided into three stages: poverty reduction, poverty reduction and wealth.
Poverty is to give people with fish, poverty is to give people with fish, and wealth is to create a “fish shore” for the farmers, and to give the farmers fish to feed.
The e-commerce industry that leads to poverty is the construction of a fish shore.
On industrial poverty reduction, Ali and Shenzhen Lowa co-founded the Lowa Apple industrial poverty reduction model, has been promoted by the relevant departments as an example in the country.
The Ali eCommerce work on poverty reduction has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been sent to ensure farmers have increased their output through online underline channels.
Some of the village's small two and Mormon's gold clothes employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce with poverty.
Currently, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) China Office has joined the village to undertake the e-commerce industry in Anguilla and other places to reduce poverty.
The "Third New Economic Intelligence Conference" held by Ali Institute and China Vision Intelligence Institute jointly took place on January 16, the head of the Electronic Commerce Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, Zhang Li, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issues, the problems of the body and use of globalization, and the problems of the phase of globalization.
Thus, many people believe that globalization is stagnant, and many developed countries and developing countries, in the new stages, have different attitudes to globalization, are different to models.
The second concept is the question of the mid-term phase of globalization, what is the mid-term phase of globalization?
Restrictions under the economic basis of the environment, just because the economic basis has changed and globalization has only been restricted.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is essentially over, after 2018 it will enter a new growth period, and the next round of growth must be the bioprodukt attraction.
Kyoto’s first fresh supermarket 7FRESH has been officially opened and plans to set more than 1,000 stores in the country in the next three to five years.
In addition to Ali's box of marshmallow, Eternal Super Species, Sunin's Suarez, Merchandise's Handfish Fresh, and so on, "New Retail Store" begins to accumulate appearances, and in the innovative model and even the price of each other "call board".
Fresh supermarket competition war upgrade, has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail sector, where is the new retail?
“In 2018 we will quickly enter the country, before Spring Festival we will open a lot of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou.
The Chairman of the Box Ma Marzhen, Hu Yi, on 10th of May, on the second new retail summit, revealed the “new approach” of 2018.
“From 2018, Box Horse is not just a fresh e-commerce, but a live quality e-commerce that meets consumers’ immediate service.
The core model under the line is flow, experience, online is real sales.
Unlike the traditional big stores, supermarkets, the box is a fun and delicious "net red store" in the eyes of many consumers, and even the intermediate agencies put the concept of "box area room".
Online e-commerce platforms and underline retailers each have disadvantages, but consumers appear in many channels, so both sides are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes that in the big background of consumption upgrades, in 2018 there will be more and more stores of "box horses".
And the Box Horse continues to explore from the original freshness to more consumer fields, which predicts that in the new year, the retail market will appear more innovation.
“For example, the online underline combined business model, attracted the eye of consumers, the fresh supermarkets opened everywhere calls it good.
“But these relationships say more, again showing nothing to do, ultimately implemented to whether you have brought a good experience to the consumer, I’m experiencing well until I’m willing to pay bills.
According to CEO Yu Yuan, in the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, the purchase demand has also changed.
Originally pure line, underline is broken, underline to defeat the line, on line to counter-attack underline, now one hand in hand, because consumers have no distinction underline.
The rivalry of capital is in place, making the current new retail firearms represented by fresh supermarkets sufficient.
The analysis suggests that the current competition of new retail in the first line of cities is far from the shape of the Red Sea, and there are a large portion of the second line of cities still to be mined, the market still has a lot of opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diverse state of development.

Total sales rebound record growth return acceleration track
Starting in 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have always showed super-speed growth, estimated that at that moment it feels online shopping is fresh, not out of the house and can also buy things, so cool!
But starting in 2013, online retail growth has begun to decline to below 50%, in 2015, the growth rate for the first time is below 40%, and in 2016 the growth rate has become 26.2%.
But this year the situation was different, online retail sales again accelerated, this year and September, the growth rate returned to 34.2%.
This is significantly higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.

Helping you to avoid the company becoming the next startup.
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate the happiness of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the investigation did not work.
The answers received are often unknown, unprofitable, and even worse, there are fraudulent answers.
Even though she promised to take an anonymous form, some employees still don’t trust the process.
Eret, responsible for managing 75 people in San Francisco e-commerce escort company Madison Reed, said the "response received was lack of consistency and objectivity."
He called for help from the outside.
A group of new human resources startups appear like a spring after the rain, helping the company understand the feelings of employees.
They build and authorize software specifically for measuring employees’ involvement, allowing companies to quickly conduct opinion tests on specific teams and populations, provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow reporters to escape executives to report directly to the board.
“Now you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit’s company?” said Jim Barnet, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City Startup Glint.
Eret says in three years she has gained more insights about the thoughts and feelings of her employees with Glint.
In addition to the quick surveys and opinion surveys of a particular team, Glint also provides the company’s hot maps, which units complain most, which managers approve a low and clear score – which enables her to understand the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they have to be skilled in controlling the company’s workplace culture in order to avoid becoming the next step.The former employees of Uber previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment, the speakers were punished by the company, and then they fell into a scandal.
For startups like Glint, this company’s supervisory desire is an immense business opportunity.
According to data from the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, the value of global governance, regulation and compliance industries might exceed $1.187.7 billion.
Convercent, a startup in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect misconduct, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this field during the time of Uber’s reputation damaged earlier this year.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed an agreement to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect secret answers in real time, and view the hot map of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Convercent’s founder and chief executive Patrick Kunland said: “The public opinion court has overturned the authority of the regulatory authorities.
If a company is found to be treated badly to its employees or to be unethical to its employees, even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere, it may face the expensive consequences of consumer resistance, employee losses, and involvement in the lawsuit.
Ruby Tuesday is a food chain across more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees, and has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees know the rules of work and the rules of work and provide easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters' phone number or e-mail, submit a formal complaint, and hope the headquarters can take it seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday’s legal adviser James Vitrano said he believed there was no good way to track employees’ complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to detect and solve problems that previously were unknown by executive offices, cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I’m able to get more closely and 360 degrees full-fledged work experience,” said Vitrano, who is responsible for the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.”
Quinland said that after the shutdown of the accountants' offices in Andorra due to the violation of the ethical standards, the companies began to focus more on ethics, values and employment since 2002.
But only after "social media entered their own world", companies realized that they couldn't stop their explosives from viral spread online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge regular costs for the use of the product from each company.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by risky investors who have already supported both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with its total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total funding of $60 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, culture and risk investments, these investments are almost not surprising.
More and more studies show that today’s employees expect more to work than before.
In the competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just betting.
Employees want to feel they are accepted, appreciated, and feel their time spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel their voice is listened, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina McCartney, vice president of LinkedIn’s Global Welfare and Employee Experience.
Investors reward when their portfolio company performs well; the company performs well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It is not surprising that if the third-party analytics tools commit to increasing the loyalty and dedication of employees, they will seek financial support.
The workplace culture experts say the knowledge of employees’ dedication data is very important.
However, unless the company’s administrators take action, these data are useless.
In fact, if a company requires employees to provide feedback, it can be expected that the company is changing.
If the change is not progressing quickly enough, or without a bit of progress, it may result in disappointment and lead to employees from the company.
Russell Rats, the consulting business chief at Cote International, said: “If you want to ask for 4,000 advice, then you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations and he has seen some companies overly depend on data collection errors.
“Because if you don’t follow all the way, the staff will think, ‘Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why do I care about it?”
Eret said Madison Reed is now carrying out a monthly employee survey and has been able to take action on the day Glint reports the issue.
After gathering employees’ feedback about their failures due to the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by reorganizing the company’s internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights about its employees, and in the long run they hope to be able to make a transition in this industry known for its high talent loss rate and better retain employees.
“If you’re not committed to creating a transparent culture, you’ll lose your talent,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose talent, you’ll lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the company.

NCAA cancells training twice a day to extend the training time of the Bear Team day
The time was near at 11 a.m., and the football team of the University of California, Los Angeles, walked alongside the team’s new campus stage.
Some players have removed their sports shirt and revealed the body that was swallowed after the first day of training.
For a large part of the team, this free minute is a time of rest.
Players who participate in the summer course will return to the end exam after three hours of exercise and then return to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next day to attend the meeting.
“The next three days are a blurry for these guys,” Bear team coach Jim Mora said on Monday when it was about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (for the purpose of reducing the player’s burden), but actually extended their day training time – at least before the end of Friday.
That’s why the first three trainings at the University of California in Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adapt to the player’s scheduled time.
From the cancellation of two times a day to the more one-day training, the Bear team started training almost a week before the last season, with Mora training in the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of Westwood.
They are scheduled to take 18 training matches starting on 20 August, and then to start preparations for the official match for the first-ever Texas Farmers in September.
Mora said he supported the regulation adjustment of the NCAA, although this would make the players busy on the journey adding another project.
“In three or four days, we’ll give them a huge amount of training and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“They’re just passing. they’re training, they’re all great kids.
I think Saturday, we’ll have more time, really great.
When the training camp ends, the University of California's Los Angeles department will stop training. considering the nearby parking area and the clear sight of the Luskin Center, this is not an easy task.
Starting this weekend, the Bear team will stay in the hotel, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms are empty in the middle of the season, there may be problems.
“We will take security measures,” Mora said.
“This is a really worrying question: the idea that someone might rent a room, sit in the room and record training scenes is not strong.
If you have a training video tape, it’s pretty good.
But there we will take security measures, and security measures will be taken in the parking lot number 8.
We will use the existing resources to do the best.
I am not too worried about this.
We have prepared a plan.

Facebook will launch facts verification feature to fight fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it will send more potential malware articles to third-party detection agencies and show the detection results below the original post.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using updates machine to learn to detect possible malware and send it to the facts verifier, and may show the facts verification results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of the so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters facing a flame of false stories before the French presidential election in May, and Germany first passed the support of the penalty plan before the September elections, and if the social media network fails to remove hate posts in time, they will be punished.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that it is launching a new facts verification test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook News Feedback Product Manager Sarah Suu Kyi said in a blog: “In addition to seeing what stories are questioned by third-party facts verificators, people want more backgrounds to help them make wise decisions about the content they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news quotes to reduce fake news.
Create a painting novel: The Story of the Castle of England
Recently, the small Scotney Castle became the protagonist in the compressed music film, and once became the shelter of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s.
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turmoil history in a comfortable location in the Bale River Canyon, Kent, and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man who has a special hobby for historical documents and keeps his head trapped).
“I can see the notes of the old man 300 years ago, and I find that’s so beautiful,” he said with his eyes.
“What kind of human fate can make this letter fall on my hand?
Through the Middle Ages until Edward's time, "A Castle of England" read the records of the various families living in Scotney, each story was made by different, British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not the first book of Rhodes to archive as a raw material: he also wrote The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the British Library Literature, a work completed by his uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, “I could not stop my writing impulse from the moment I saw the fingerprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent of the 18th century working for the Jacobite.
That’s his fingerprint!
And the letter always smells with a smoke, because at that time, you need to light the light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel they are also around us.
Oh, I like archive literature!”
For those who are touched by the old paper, getting the support of the National Trust and Art Council of England and living in the castle for four months (‘Truly, I’ve been a little long time’) seems great, just don’t believe it’s true.
Rhodes spent a few days visiting the “new” castle of Victoria, browsing archives, exploring many treasures and ancient toys of the palace, such as hanging on the walls, and bottles spent centuries in the city’s gardens, and so on.
He walks on the land and ruins of the Old Castle, talks with the escapers, the gardeners, and sometimes with the painting artists in his books.
Then in the evening, he will drink a little whisky and then write.
Scotney's secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only entered it completely after the last heir Elizabeth Hesse died in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the files, he described them as "The nobles of hundreds of years ago are going to go: "Oh, put it in the roof."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, and maps of the territory of the countries: “You’ll think the land dispute will be boring,” Rhodes said, “but there’s two families who will take a big hand for a whiten tree.
Let me go, guys!”
Some of the stories of the work take the castle as a starting point, which leads to a wider study of the history of Britain, including The Labourer, which is a human clue to a man who leaves the new castle to participate in the 1381 farmer rebellion.
“The story in the book, Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, records a revolt in the castle in 1380,” Rodz says.
“The peasant rebellion began in that area, and I think it’s a good place to launch the rebellion.
Maybe these two are connected?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the story's master is the 18th-century trader Arthur Darrell, who is believed to be a funeral to himself by filling the cage with stones (a few years after his cage revealed the ground, people only discovered).
The Darrells is Rhodes’ favorite Scotney Castle family: “These gentlemen seem to be wicked, always borrowing money and spending money to buy things they can’t buy.
Generation after generation Darrell men by marrying a wealthy old woman to solve their debt problems, I think they should be a group of beautiful guys who know how to pursue a woman.
As his mission in the castle ends, Rhodes begins to look for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a painting novel in the wilderness of Finland for two weeks, containing about "El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki", which was a early 20th century hospital and was later slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
“I’m sadly leaving,” he said.
“It’s like, ‘Oh, I’m going to face the real life of the sandwich.’”

Big energy companies are all “rich and enemy countries”, so who of the world’s many energy companies is the most profitable?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 ranking of 2011 listed energy companies, the U.S. oil and natural gas producer ExxonMobil won the U.S. Championship with a market value of $40.63 billion, followed by China Petroleum and the Royal Dutch Shell.
In this PFC list, China Petroleum has been ranked twice in 2007 and 2009, with the remaining rankings all occupied by ExxonMobil.
In the top 50 list of 2011, there were three companies from China's interior, in addition to the second-largest Chinese oil, the ninth Chinese petrochemical and the fifteenth Chinese marine oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, despite the current oil prices far higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy pointed out that there are many reasons that lead to low overall market value, mainly including the decline in North American natural gas prices, and the low activity of the global stock market.

U.S. Green Card Regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump's speech as saying the U.S. will launch a new immigration plan and amend the Green Card rules.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people a year, with temporary work visa and family-oriented visa applications being restricted by more strict regulations.
The new regulations are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed within the two chambers.
According to Trump, “the law will reduce poverty, increase wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and the benefits by changing the way the United States gives green cards to citizens of other countries.”
The law will replace the current program, reducing chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have the skills that are beneficial for economic development.

Sex Robots Are Really Rise, But We Should Be Careful
Just as you think 2017 will not be more strange, a new technology development report on sex robotics has been published.
Yes to.
Sex robotics are important now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report that predicts the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Sheffield University’s Honorary Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Professor and FRR co-founder Noel Shaki, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robotics.
Customers can choose the color of the eye, the shape of the breast and the type of nails of the robot.
Shaki said in a new report: “People are laughing behind, but big companies have actually launched a lot of sex robots, and we’re going to see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from charger dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, touch very warm, and also specifically use artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “adjust” their robots to meet their preferences, from the color of the eyes, the shape of the breast to the type or color of the nails.
But more troubling, many robots with a “personality” will make the “copy-wife” look very advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into a robot with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined based on user-thinking attractive features, such as shame.
The Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, can also pre-set character features, including somewhat shy “cold-fashioned” and “adventory” wild vintage.
“Roxxxy Gold’s robot has as much personality as possible to you,” said True Companion’s website.
So she loves what you love, evil you evil.
She had little emotions in those days as a normal person!
She can be foolish, can talk well, and can also be ‘sex-bound’!”
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of anxiety—not just replacing true human relationships—and the most worrying is the female characteristics of the naked knees, as well as the suggestions of rape on the cool (interpreted as: resistance) Farah.
True Companion compares Roxxxy on its website to a male shock.
The site says, "If a woman has a shock bar, then why should men not have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not a simple love, nor just a sex toy.
Their appearance and growing maturity directly refers to the darker and deeper part of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality to submission to sex as an additional option.
Of course, most men will not have sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more and more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But the things that penetrate from the edge allow us to see the process of this era in which we are.
Many people were neither strange nor aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
These subtle sex robots appear in a time in which women’s rights are threatened globally, and the White House has a president whispering sexual violence against women, which is not a coincidence.
The most crazy part of the TV series "The Story of a Woman" is not the realist picture, not the suspension of the body, not the pair of the eyes that are grabbed, but the excessively real imagination.
The Republic of Kyle was a jump, but now it seems not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make the technology possible to create the most similar to real female body (although according to the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human movement.
But honestly, their “personality” does not represent a real woman.
They can neither split nor leave.
They have no aid seeking agencies, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no imagination of slavery that could be completely broken.
In other words, they are passionate slaves.
Or according to the tradition of 2017: make a woman.
The Long City tells the story of the ancient times, a Chinese elite force for the defense of mankind, in the world-famous Long City, conducting a life-threatening battle with monsters.
The last episode of the fourth season has been recorded, "Running Men's Group" Captain Dunper on May 30 received a microscope interview from Shenzhen Evening, Shenzhen Network Reporter, from "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's" to "Running Men's".
Dunper said, "In the show, the same thing I don't do, I have to keep updating."
The great success of Trump?
Mitt Romney becomes a shadow of common sense.
Political disagreements lead to the bilateral separation of the US voters, and from a microscopic point of view, they destroy the peace of the American family.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers were filled with comment columns of how to respond to the fear of voting Trump's relatives.
It is often thought that we are doing our best to break our “filter bubble.”
Less to say is that Trump has the power to unite the family together.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long disagreed with the Republicans in our house, this week he is going to visit me in New York.
She reminds me that joining together against the common enemy can have a strong effect.
Since she has worked with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including even the Republican relatives who have been in political disputes for decades, is now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front.
If it’s all on the table, it’s obviously a good thing. but I’m surprised that from a wider perspective, it’s causing significant risks.
Although the leftist character has always been trapped by Trump, the trace effect he has brought as president pushes us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, what we mean is the possibility of concern that his strange behavior may one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario that Trump wants to “normalize” the relations with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President’s standards and now suddenly seemed to be a symbol of rationality.
I recently found myself missing some astonishing epilepsy of Mitch Romney: putting the dog on the car, 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax declaration), for the two actions to be compared to Trump seemed really too mild.
After the past of the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs only reasonably to get the qualifications for unprecedented improvement.
When my cousin lived in the town, we took the kids to the New York Park, the largest rotating trees run by the Central Park Administration of New York, and if you don’t need coffee, this $3 ticket is the most consumer value for you in this city.
The sound of the trumpet was as massive as a rainbow, the central column was designed for glass fiber, all the lions and animals turned their heads, scary and scary looking at their shoulders, and the sound of the music was strange.
Too many modest cities are disappointing: the landscapes of the high buildings are becoming old, the heavens are becoming too familiar and can’t provide too much excitement, and the reality of the city is not supporting the dreams.
35 years later, I didn’t completely forget that day, I found that “Swiss Cottage” was actually not a Swiss Cottage, but a theme bar “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” I don’t remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the Central Park's rotating triangle remains a magical experience, and everyone is fun for the events that can be attended by two 2-year-old children, a 11-year-old child, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the rotating triangle, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week in a retail company, I was asked to score one to five stars on my “experience” trading before cleaning my credit card.
In the coffee shop in my corner of the street, it’s the same, in addition, you can choose to score with a 15% discount, which is for shopping on the box.
The effect of this was not only to slow down the speed of transactions that should be neutral, but also to press the servers, adding personal factors to unnecessary scenarios.
The poor woman in the store laughed with apology, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius is transferred from prison to hospital for breast pain.
This is the second time Pistorius leaves the prison and is transferred to the hospital.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Industrial Enterprise Structure Adjustment Special Subscription Fund Management Measures", which will arrange special subscription funds to promote the dismantling of excess production capacity of the coal and steel industry, the total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, several local governments, including Shanghai, Shandong, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Chalonjiang, have subsequently submitted reform opinions on the dismantling of excess production capacity.
Of these, many provinces even proposed to actively seek financial support from the Central Finance to their provinces.
One proof is that only eight provinces have announced the target of coal production capacity to stand up to 90% of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with the journalists, Xiamen University's Chief Executive of China Energy Policy Institute, Lin Berjong, said that the "production capacity" of the steel and coal industry is far from sufficient to rely on the central 100 billion yuan, and more funds are needed by local governments and from the line of solution.
In the rules for the implementation of coal production capacity recently published in the province of Shenzhen, the Shenzhen Coal Group proposed to be reorganized to state-owned capital investment companies, to reorganiz the assets and operations of the enterprises, and to build a new business model.
The actual gap of funds may be three times the subsidy previously, the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Yin Yin said that the initial statistics "to produce capacity" to distribute the employees of the coal system is 1.3 million people, the steel system is 500,000 people.

Does butter, milk and chocolate help to relieve inflammatory intestinal disease (IBD)?
Butter and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study finds the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms associated with inflammatory intestinal disease.
This illness affects the lives of approximately 1.3 million Americans and approximately 300,000 British, leading to stomach inflammation, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers found protein-critical amino acids help promote the growth of immune cells, which can increase intestinal resilience.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explains that immune cells are patroled in the intestines, ensuring that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not silently enter the body.
Itins balance between the cells that cause inflammation and the cells that enhance tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the balance state is too predisposed to inflammation, inflammatory intestinal disease may occur.
In the experiments, a cell that promotes immunity appears in small mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need coloric acid (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna says: “We have established a link between a bacterial group (Royce, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial group) and the development of a tolerant cell group.
The more pigs are consumed in the diet, the more their immune cells are.
He suggests that if humans use the same method, a combination of Lactobacterium and a diet rich in coloric acid may form a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The post-doctoral researcher, Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studied an increasingly tolerant immune cell when she found a group of researching mice had such cells, but the other group of the same bacteria did not feed separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal microorganisms of small mice (refer to bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach).
The DNA sequence of the cholesterol in small mice found that there were 6 bacterial groups in the body of mice with immune cells, but there were no small mice without immune cells.
Small mice grows in an inbacterial environment, therefore they lack intestinal microorganisms, and these immune cells cannot appear, and in the presence of Luther's bacteria they produce immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivate lucifer in the liquid and then transfer a small amount of non-bacterial fluid to the unmatched immune cells separated from the small mice.
The immune cells develop into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a side-product of the metabolism of fluoride, known as propyl-3-lactate.
When the researchers doubled the number of color amino acids in small mouse feed, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but when the levels of color amino acids decreased by half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same increasing tolerance cells, and most of us have luciferic bacteria in our stomach.
Is it unclear whether humans can trigger cell development by a subproduct of fluoride in the body, like the small mice in the experiment, but genetic defects associated with fluoride have been found in inflammatory intestinal diseases.
She said, “The development of these cells may be exactly the result we want to get, as these cells can control the inflammatory reaction on the intestinal surface.
It can be not accurately said that the high levels of fluoric acid present in the Luchic bacteria may lead to an increase in the number of the bacteria.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed “Genius” Neymar Matic
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Neymar Matic at the Sampdoria match, Mourinho found Manchester United signed a "genial" middle player.
Matic from Chelsea, signed an agreement of £40 million and played 2-1 on Tuesday in Dublin in the last season before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid, winning Paul Bogba and Andreas Perella's favourites.
However, in the Pre-Bruce Asian Tour, Matic's match status was severe and only completed 45 minutes, and Mourinho acknowledged the need for improvements before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom, and genius way of thinking – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
We will help him to be ready as soon as possible.
Mourinho began to arrange his premiere at the beginning of this season. Like Matic, the newly signed players Viktor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at Ingevar Stadium.
The Independent newspaper this week that Mourinho still wanted to introduce three more signed players, but he insisted that the club "worked great" and he had four preferred signed players in his heart, and the club has already introduced three of them.
“The club has introduced three of the signed players, and I’m very grateful for he added.
“If the club could bring all four players, I’d be happier, but they’ve made a lot of effort for me.
Is China going to go back if it didn’t build this type of ships?
With the recent world's great marine powers later announced the construction plan of a new type of guard ship, as if a night of guard ship has become the focus of the attention of the marine of the great powers, first Japan in the 2018 annual defense budget determined the purchase of two new types of guard ship, so Japan's DEX guard ship program finally has a substantial breakthrough, then the U.S. Rockefeller Martin recently announced the latest program of the U.S. F.F.G. guard ship program, then China's new guard ship should go from where?
With the end of 2017 the latest 054A type of guard, marking that 054A type of guard has been built up to 29 ships, has approached the total of 053H series of guard ships, and since 2006 the first 054A type of guard has been built for 12 years, even throughout the world, the construction of so many high-performance general guard ships, except China, and only the U.S. "Peri" type of guard ships built in the past 7th and 80th centuries can be compared.
And why to build so many 054A is also simple, that is affordable, useful, and additionally supplementing the Navy for many years.
054A Guard Ship with a higher price ratio and good fighting strength has been a favour of the Chinese Navy for many years, its 4,000 tons of deforestation, equipped with a 76 mm main artillery, 32 units of Sea Red Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, eight Eagle shoot 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it began to be built in 2006, the design time is a very early ship, but its fighting strength even if placed to the present day is not too bad, looking at the world's Guard Ship can also reach the middle level.
But after all, this is a type of ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, weapon configuration on the side, its power system and electronic radar equipment have already existed a big gap compared to the current world's mainstream guard vessels, as the same type of guard vessels in Europe have been equipped with full-power advancement, small multi-function control radar, large-size helicopter deck, it's time to develop a new model.
Thus, how the new ships of China should develop, which is directly related to its future location and the strategic policy of our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will definitely be entirely the Blue Water Navy, and the future will also be going to the ocean, equipped with rapid deploying in the areas that are closely related to China's personal interests, showing the force existing, and if necessary able to have a strong fighting force to ensure that China's personal interests in the region are not damaged, then it seems that the new type of Hu Wei Jiang will necessarily go to the bigger and distant development.
Look at the situation of the new type of guard vessels in the future China Navy series, the future of the Chinese Navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, except for the necessary near-sea defense vessels, other main vessels will, according to the circumstances, form a aircraft carrier battle group or a battle battle group.
And the role of the new guard vessels in the future aircraft carriers fighting group should serve as an anti-potencial and mid-range airing position, and in the two-range attack vessels fighting group should serve as a guard vessels class, then according to this requirement the new guard vessels must have a strong anti-potencial capacity and good mid-range airing capacity.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the likely appearance of the future of the domestic guard vessels.
First of all, the emissions will have a significant increase compared to the current 054A type of guard ship, the estimated emissions of the new type of guard ship will reach approximately 5,000-6000 tons; the power system will take a QC280 improved gas wheel and two diesel machines composed of a comprehensive power drive system, the maximum flight speed is expected to reach approximately 30 degrees, the continuity will also increase significantly; as to the weapons configuration of 76 mm main artillery and 1130 near-defense artillery should be retained, but it will add a red flag 10 launch system, the main artillery should be a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improved and fish-8 joint venture system, the ships should be equipped with a 8-16 unit large vertical system for the emissions of the Eagle and the new carrier;
Thus, the overall level of the new type of guard ships will reach the current world’s highest level, even not more successful than the U.S. FGG.
Of course, the above concept is just the idea of the domestic new type of guard vessels, specifically how we can only wait until the new type of guard vessels fall into the water to explore what, let’s wait together.

In recent years, our city has encouraged companies to participate actively in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, to give 300,000 rewards to companies that are mainly or participate in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, to companies that are certified through Zhejiang manufacturing brand rewards 500,000, is the highest amount of this reward throughout the province, stimulating the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the objects.
Previously, the Wang Li Group production workshop, the group’s system chief, Gong Qing, and his employees are packing an anti-theft safety door cover box, as a participating Zhejiang Manufacturing Group standard sample of work, ready to be sent to the Shao Hing Quality Inspection Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group's on-site review.
Qing said that a professional team consisting of industry technology experts and quality certification organizations expressed appreciation for the group’s achievements in the core aspects of quality excellence, independent innovation, and agreed to be a complete combination, then as long as the product passed the test, Wang Yi will be one of the first companies to pass this standard.
The Wingley Group is just a stand-alone shake of the industry transformation upgrading.
The city and its synchronization of the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group's standard targeting and targeting work is also a step sun, group lifting group.
Since the Zhejiang Manufacturing Team Standards developed last year by the Zhejiang Safety Gate Industry, Star Moon, New and other companies are also actively applying for the counter-target work.
In recent years, a large amount of capital flows into the film market, the star actors' reputation and wage-wage ships are high. producer Ho Chi Minh said that the two actors in some hot film had a billion yuan wage-wage, and in the end they only played together for two days, the other theaters were basically replaced by the work.
At the moment of the actors all around the series, the same time the female and male actors in different theaters, causing the same time not to appear simultaneously on the scene, the theaters are forced to replace them to ensure the cycle.

China's family debt rate is close to the U.S. What's worse than not buying a home is not having debt?
In recent times, everyone is discussing what the real estate policy has recently changed, is the real estate policy to be relieved again?
But, when we are worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulations, worried about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again wrote, the last time we discussed the People's Daily comment on real estate regulations, and now the People's Daily writes a topic that is more serious than not to buy a house, that is, even if you can buy a house, do you have to pay debt?
Today we’re going to talk about a more serious issue than buying a house: refund.
China's increasing debt crisis
According to the data in the text, in November 2017, the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Asset Balance Research Center published the "three-quarter China to leverage process report" noted that the residential sector leverage rate continues to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, increased by 1.3 percentage points, increased by 3.8 percentage points in the three quarter of 2017 before.
Population sectors share of debt in the entire real economy is increasing, and the leverage rate rises faster.
Related studies show that the debt of Chinese families in financial institutions is mainly consumer loans, approximately 2/3 of the debt of the residents, approximately twice the business loans.
Of these, in consumer loans, medium-term loans mainly based on housing loans account for about eight percent, but from the point of view of the increase, short-term consumer loans grow faster, higher than medium-term loans.
In addition, China’s family debt rate only statistics the total amount of loans that the family sector receives from financial institutions, while China’s families have many private loans, including loans to relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debt.
According to the statistics of the Suning Financial Institute, in 1996 the residential leverage rate was only 3%, in 2008 it was only 18%, but since 2008 the residential leverage rate began to show a fast growth attitude, doubled in a short six years, reaching 36.4%. to the third quarter of 2017, the residential leverage rate has reached 48.6%.
We compare another data: in May last year, HSBC published a survey report across nine countries, with respondents approximately tens of thousands.
The report is visited by “Millennium Generation” young people from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China’s housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 is up to 70%, far ahead of Mexico (46%) and twice the level of the U.S. index (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem that is that, compared to the unacquisition of houses, the largest potential "green rhinoceros" in the current stage of the Chinese population is estimated to be not borrowed.
Why is the debt crisis the most serious issue?
As we previously analyzed, although we’ve been saying China’s housing prices are high, but compared to other countries in the world, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high, then with it saying the housing prices are high, I’m afraid now to ask a lot of friends the question is you still have to get a loan?
We look around the world’s real estate market, China’s real estate market because of the late start, except for Hainan we said before, there has not yet been a big real estate crisis, but just a decade ago the origins of the 2008 global financial tsunami were the real estate crisis in the U.S.
The cause of the U.S. real estate crisis is due to two rooms: real estate and real estate.
At the time in the American Golden Age, real estate companies, in order to expand their sales, sold the houses at a very low first payment to the low-income population of the time in the United States, when the U.S. economy went well, the real estate market was also a glory, but the prospect was not long, as the U.S. economy emerged growth stagnation, caused housing buyers' revenues to decline, so large household consumption spending began to decline.
But the current state in the United States was part of the financial assets and real estate assets of the U.S. family assets, almost all the family assets of the low-income groups in the U.S. were real estate, and most of the top 20 percent of high-income groups were financial assets, which resulted in the higher debt rates of the poorest households in the U.S.
A serious fact is that these people all bought houses in the better economic times, so the money paid for housing was also calculated by their better income, and when the income came down, the pressure of housing was not only not decreased even because some sub-loan plans became floating, so the real estate issues of these U.S. families evolved so gradually into a real estate crisis.
Therefore, because the income is too low, the bank begins to regain the property, and when the bank regains the property from the hands of the borrowing housing buyers, they will sell it at a very low price, which leads to the area's housing prices step by step down, this process again causes the housing prices to further decline, forms a bad cycle, when the housing prices fall to a certain degree, more and more housing buyers find their housing value is even lower than their loans, so there are more people who stop continuing to regain the housing, and cause more bad accounts.
Therefore, a huge evil cycle is formed about this:
“Economic disaster – income decreases – some people are still unable to pay loans – banks sell low-cost houses to debtors – houses fall – more people stop returning loans – banks sell again – houses fall again...”
And the problem is more than that, because the housing price continues to fall, everyone stop loans back to the house to the bank after it is not you have no debt, if the bank’s auction house gets the money is still not up to your bank’s debt loan, then you still need to return the money, simply say assume you with the first payment of 600,000, the loan of 2.4 million buy a set of the house at the time worth 3 million, when the housing price falls to this house worth only 2 million, you are no longer loans back to the house to the bank, after the bank’s auction house, you are not only losing your first payment of 600,000, but also the bank’s debt of 400,000, you are still going to return the money.
So, just under such a wicked cycle, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually caused the 2008 U.S. financial crisis.
Therefore, the level of China’s household debt rate reached the high level of 46.8% is a very careful issue, this data in the present sight is still lower than the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country has repeatedly emphasized the problem of leverage since the beginning of last year, which is a very predictive judgment that if the household debt rate leaves it to continue to rise, it will inevitably cause a huge risk, so to strictly prevent the emergence of financial risks.
Therefore, after the house is used for living, not used for throwing, the country is faster to establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rental and joint measures, and more to resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, it is necessary to give up the real estate speculation thinking, to go quantitatively when buying a house, to avoid the family falling into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels can be a healthy family wealth development path.

He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, Senior Advisor Anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hampshire, Winston Churchill, to ensure that the implantation process meets the medical standards.
The technology is similar to the cat chip implant, and it takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Nuther's company will also replace the locks of each room and vehicle to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.

On July 10, the National Bureau of Statistics published the National Residential Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June 2016 and the Industrial Manufacturers Factory Price Index (PPI).
The White House costs thousands.
According to a military record published by the Time magazine, last month the White House decided to shift a Navy helicopter to the Southern Grass to mark the enormous glory of the U.S. manufacturing industry, costing up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Navy's 1st Army) was an important exhibition in the U.S. construction project on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have inspected manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibition includes a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine-based yacht, a Wisconsin-based firefighter and a Mississippi-based fighter.
According to the records of the first helicopter fleet (HMX-1), the White House Military Office requested the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the Southern Grass to participate in this "special" activity.
One day before the event, the commander of HMX-1 said in an email sent to the Supreme Navy Flight Deputy Commander: "I just want to confirm you know, because this event is highly appreciated.
The information suggests that the helicopter will arrive at Southern Grass at about 7 a.m. on July 17 at 3 a.m. and will leave only after the grass is cleaned at 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. on the same night.
The information also says that if the time of departure from the White House is delayed, the return will require a second team of crew because of the time limit.
The former crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew crew
The records obtained by Time magazine have not been clearly indicated whether the second group of crew is needed in the end.
The Hachi Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 has been questioned whether this activity violates the bill.
The commander wrote: "One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hachi Act and was told that there was no violation of the Hachi Act."
“It sounds like you’ve been locked,” the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines this “American Made” activity as a official activity, and therefore is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Hachi Act.
But even official activities have a political color.
During the campaign, the president promoted the subject of the Senate at the time: the reform of healthcare, and promoted the control of government regulations.
The use of Navy Army 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer a new thing.
The past presidents were asked to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to use it only for photography purposes.
In February, Trump was worried, when in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential flight slowly slapped and eventually stopped in the background of his first campaign meeting, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential flight.
White House spokesman Linsey Waltz said: “The White House is excited about the next ‘Made in America’ exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states, all of which are made by American workers using American materials.
The HMX-1 crew staff frequently fly training near Washington and Southern Grass, exercising the presence of the President of the United States in the White House.
During the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
A official said this U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in the training requirements of the crew this month.
The helicopter forces also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” on the same day.
The White House said the taxpayer would not bear the costs of any other instrument in the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company did not participate in arranging the Southern Grass helicopter exhibition.
The HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for the presidential flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defense’s 2017 financial year short-time costs record, the VH-3D’s defense ministry can reimburse the costs of $24,380 per flight hour.
Forces recorded the time of the aircraft flying from the base airport of the Navy Army in Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Waltz said, “The estimation of the taxpayer’s costs based on reimbursable fees is very misleading.
These estimated costs include staff costs, maintenance costs, and many more, including the flooding costs in the annual funds.
A 2015 RAND study found that the refundable costs of the Ministry of Defense do not include personnel costs, but actually include oil, maintenance and order costs.
At that time, former White House spokesman Sean Spike defended using the helicopter for the activity.
“The idea is to show what America has made this week.
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they all have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of people who do not work on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans.
This is obviously not an untouchable point.
We are unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting the Southern Grass during the event, but he was actually sitting on the driver's seat of the fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky’s representatives and joked with the media about the company’s own plane.
He said, “I know the Sikorsky aircraft very well.

And large amounts of investments don’t bring the corresponding economic benefits, which is a major reason why the quality and efficiency of economic growth in my province are poor.
In this regard, experts recommend that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutions should also be "transmitted" to enterprises in time.
For the efficiency of the industrial economy is not high, experts say, it is also necessary to actively promote the industrial integration reorganization, optimize the industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.
