The cumulative outbreak of the rapidly growing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in similar trends in EU/EEA member states and the UK suggests that the same pattern is true for all countries, although the outbreak is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience gained from the disease in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the large wave of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2020, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the disease, a new coronavirus, will henceforth be known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The available documentation to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 patients develop mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 turned into a more severe illness that required hospitalization, while the remaining 6% developed severe illness and were admitted to intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates in each EU/EEA country and the UK and compared them to trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 infections in EU/EEA member states and the UK
Following China, COVID-19 spread to more geographic areas, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the same pattern in the country.
On 11 March, the Secretary General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first European confirmed case of the coronavirus as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among travellers returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the end of the reporting period, with Italy alone having 1,775 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Collecting cumulative COVID-19 case counts and incidence
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country of the world is reported daily from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities in these countries and the World Health Organization, and is updated at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As a basis for determining the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a shortened cumulative incidence period of 14 days for COVID-19 patients, so the normal COVID-19 incidence period, in each EU/EEA member state and the UK, was taken into account in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of cases per country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020 was also compared with the number during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 infection trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends observed in the 14-day shortened cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK were generally consistent with trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, in the EU/EEA member states and the UK, cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks began around 21 February and then began to rapidly increase around 28 February 2020 (content attached).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA member states and the UK also showed similar upward trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (attached claim).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It explained that as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA member countries and the United Kingdom reported total cases, which was comparable to Italy's figures for the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of definitive COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in EU/EEA Member States and the UK.
Observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks suggest that the pandemic is spreading at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries experience different stages of the outbreak, there are differences in how public health authorities respond, and different criteria apply in different countries for people who need to undergo a COVID-19 confirmation or supplemental test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the infected areas of Italy reported a situation where about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media sources reported that the maximum capacity of hospitals and intensive care wards in these areas had already been filled.
Currently, among EU/EEA Member States, data on hospitalization and/or intensive care for COVID-19 patients are available only in 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be compiled in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data and focus on a number of reported and mortality categories.
A survey conducted in 2010-11 found wide disparities in access to intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that these countries have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios related to health and treatment capacity saturation with estimates for each EU/EEA Member State and the UK were presented in relation to the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized patients with a risk > 90% exceeding the capacity of ICU beds in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Since the cases have been observed in clusters in specific regions in EU/EEA member states and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a regional population, information on the cases and intensive care beds should preferably be provided in accordance with the territorial unit procedure for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of the disease in Italy and current trends in other countries suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA Member States and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the scenario of continued mass transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and provide the necessary facilities to receive COVID-19 patients, especially in intensive care units, just as happened in the infected areas of Italy.
As stated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is necessary to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to shift from restrictions to slowing the pace of the epidemic, as if the necessary measures are not taken in advance, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision-making institutions and hospitals with sufficient opportunity to identify, accept and implement appropriate responses.
A rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic.
Countries have a short window of time to strengthen their control efforts and slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, thus reducing pressure on healthcare systems.
Failing this, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a large influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and sickened more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, thus leading to a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats, similar to its homologous SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, and may cause similar symptoms by following a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lethal than SARS, but is more transmissible, infecting older people and men more often than young people and women.
In response to the growing number of publications on this emerging disease, this meeting seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this highly relevant research topic.
We will provide basic information on epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, it is hoped that this review study will be effective in identifying and eradicating this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unforgettable event for all Chinese who were asked to stay home for the entire holiday and many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has high hemology with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) chose the name SARS-CoV-2 for it and the name of the associated disease, CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) (coronavirus disease-19 or COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 5 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases, with more than 40,000 discharged and more than 3,000 deaths.
"The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is ""public enemy number 1"" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism".
According to the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published covering topics including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first article on January 7, 2020, on the determination of virus genomic sequencing sampled from several patients.
This review aims to summarize research advances in new and emerging areas of interest.
In possible cases, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-related disease called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which became common in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis, as well as a number of vital questions that remain.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, accounting for about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the initial outbreaks in 2003 in China and 2012 in Saudi Arabia, respectively, and spread to other countries in a short time, causing terrible disease and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus spread.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of foot-and-mouth disease was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, other provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infections of healthcare workers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission of the virus is also possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan completed the quarantine and public transportation was completely stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 40 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, where the disease originated from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of this writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As the situation is changing rapidly, the extent and ultimate severity of the outbreak must be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study involving 8,866 coronavirus patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more recent representation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected people of all ages, but has mainly infected those aged 65-30.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects more men (0.31 out of 100,000) than women (0.27 out of 100,000).
COVID-19 spread in clusters in and around Hubei.
Diagnosis of COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (9-2 days) from the time of onset.
The average period of the common (7.2-3.0) is 4.8 days.
The average time from onset to death (13-4.8) was 9.5 days.
The base multiplication rate (R<sub>0</sub>) was 3.77 (with approximate confidence: 4.05-3.51) and the modified R<sub>0</sub> was 4.82-2.23.
The number of infected cases rose exponentially before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the time of the increase in travel volumes before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed patient mortality was 1.44% (with 95% confidence equivalent: 1.86-1.10%) and the adjusted all-patient mortality rate was 3.06% (with 95% confidence equivalent: 4.59-2.02%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (60 years or older) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, covering viruses that contain a single strand of meaningful RNA.
They are classified into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, among which, alpha and beta human coronaviruses are infectious.
The spike glycoprotein (S) covering SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses binds to and fuses with their cell membranes, respectively, to their cell receptors called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA, along with its coating of glycoproteins and nucleopsid proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of new viruses.
The first genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported on January 10, 2020.
The findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of beta coronavirus with 10 samples recovered from the main outbreak site at the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, showing a 99.98% similarity.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through scanning with a portable electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superfine sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 receptor more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 also produces a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secretory protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b plays a role in the pathogenic properties of the virus and inhibits IFNβ (interferon beta) expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known secondary or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the structure of the human ACE2 complement electron cryomicroscope receptor with a resolution of 2.9 angstrom in the complex with an amino acid carrier called B0AT1.
They found that the above complex, which has open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins that can be used as a criterion for the diagnosis and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for screening drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It has been determined that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via the San Zabat cat and camel, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were identified as the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host has helped the virus cross the strain boundaries and infect humans is still unknown and the route of transmission has yet to be clearly determined.
Jay and colleagues suggested that snakes were transmitters of the virus from bats to humans by neutrophils homologous to the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that pangolins - long-snouted  ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology with a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, definitive results are expected to provide consistent evidence (Figure 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in-vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment at temperatures below 20°C and humidity of 50-40% for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to the following factors that can effectively inactivate the virus: ultraviolet radiation and exposure to 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, antifungal solution containing chlorine, prasectic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but chlorhexidine does not have this ability.
Overall, all human populations lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in any studies.
So we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
The virus is generally detected by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including the C-type semi-lectin receptors, the TLR, the NLR, and the RIG-I.
The virus induces functions such as inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) through various pathways that limit viral spread and accelerate phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein associated with SARS-CoV can help to save the virus from immune system responses.
An adaptive immune response will soon be in place to combat the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to stimulate specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, the COVAIRUS can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Hematopoietic immunity includes complementary cells including C3a and C5a, and antibodies also play a role in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes the production of large volumes of localized free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
The risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by a cluster outbreak, is higher in people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is normal for people exposed to large numbers of viruses or people with impaired immune function to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average approximate lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, with a study of the first 425 patients in Wuhan showing that the lifespan is mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the period of the common was on average 3 days and varied from 0 to 24 days in total.
A more recent study, mentioned above, reported a cumulative duration of 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days based on a demographic review of 8,866 patients.
It is of utmost importance for health authorities to apply effective quarantine time based on the most accurate common period to prevent transmission of the virus to others by infected but asymptomatic individuals.
As a general procedure, people who are infected with the virus or infected should be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often, fever is the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may occur alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients developed shortness of breath and/or reduced tissue oxygenation a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, infectious shock, metabolic acidosis and blood clotting disorder were observed in patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if they do not have abnormalities in the bladder imaging, should be screened for rapid virus detection.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms observed in patients were as follows: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies in a familial cluster and a cluster formed by transmission through asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms of the disease.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and corresponded to a higher mortality rate of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%), and sore throat (21%), were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, the main symptoms included fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%), and about 14% to 20% of patients required respiratory assistance.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576, the global COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
For comparison, the SARS mortality rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed patients.
In relation to MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed patients, according to a demographic study in June 2012.
An earlier study reported that the <i>R</i><i>0</i></sub> of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 long with a confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, while the <i>R0</i> of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> are presented in Table 1.
The above numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate is lower than these two categories.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clusters often start within a family or community or a single vehicle such as a pleasure boat.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within a two-week period prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing any symptoms, and it is possible that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may still have the virus, leading to an alert to extend the period of quarantine.
In the early stages, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or decreases.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×4 cells per liter, including a lymphocyte count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×1 cells per liter, and increased concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia (viral activity in blood) were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of hepato-muscular enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients were found to be elevated, and C-reactive protein and red blood cell sedimentation in the blood of most patients were elevated.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
Abnormalities are found in chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients and include symmetrical shadows of fragments or round glass curves in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely impair the exchange of respiratory gases.
Functional impairment of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and, as a result, increases surface tension, which in turn reduces the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of a lung collapse.
Thus, the most severe chest X-ray findings were consistent with the most severe disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 disease identified the following symptoms: paralysis of lung lymphocytes, formation of a transparent membrane, truncation of intracellular lymphocytes, and observation of multiple cystic sinus cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease; symptoms consistent with viral infection pathology and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Dystrophy Syndrome) and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed by reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the primary criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high false negative rate that may accelerate the epidemic, clinical demonstrations for diagnosis (a diagnostic method that no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation existed with respect to SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group introduced the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2, whereby synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 virus in volumes ranging from <18-</sup>10 × 20 moles per liter to <18-</sup>10 × 200 moles per liter (100-10 copies per microliter of input) are detected by a rod in less than an hour without the need for complex equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique could improve sensitivity and comfort if confirmed in clinical trials.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are primarily providing supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also attempting to use a variety of therapeutic measures that have been used or proposed to treat previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include psychotherapy and potential treatment with antiviral medications, immune system suppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The use of plasma from recovered patients for the treatment of new patients has also been suggested.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other ACE2 receptor-expressing organs such as the digestive system and the pollen.
However, respiratory distress and insufficiency are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, assisted breathing solutions are of vital importance to relieve symptoms and save patients' lives and include treatment with regular oxygen, long oxygen circulation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified post-inflammatory cardiomyopathy technique that has been used to treat heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and infectious shock, and protecting vital organ function are also of critical importance in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been shown that cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients are caused by immune system overreaction.
Cytokine cyclone is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large amount of free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Suppression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tuclizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapeutic approaches for cytokine storm include: T cell-mediated immune response modulation; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; blenatumum; inhibiting cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune system suppressant drugs were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not useful in the treatment of severe lung damage in COVID-19 and SARS patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, particularly osteoporosis caused by anemia, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, it is recommended to use short courses of low to moderate dose corticosteroids with caution for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral drug has been approved.
However, intravenous administration of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
RedSevere is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead primarily for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was found that remdesivir may also have an inhibitory effect on other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Accordingly, Gilead made the compound available to China for two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected vertebrates, with results that were fully as expected.
In addition, baricetinib, interferon alfa, lupinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were also used as potential medications for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions can occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between these medications and other medications used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients recovered and antibody production increased.
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease, for the purpose of treating other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infection, has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign particles, which identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Accordingly, plasma was collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 very severe patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and they saw a reduction in inflammation, a reduction in viral load, and an improvement in oxygen saturation in their blood.
However, proposing this approach for large-scale use requires approval and further transparency before specific therapies are available.
In addition, in addition to therapeutic effects, adverse reactions associated with plasma therapy should also be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which can lead to a lethal toxicity.
Blood antibody concentrations are usually low, and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat people with very severe disease.
Developing and producing specific antibodies in a fast-paced timeframe to combat global epidemics is difficult.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying genetic codes that code for effective antibodies or screening for effective antibodies against effective virus proteins is more critical and practical.
This can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of ailments.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of several components in a formula that is based on the diagnosis of disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear because extraction and validation of these ingredients or their optimal compositions is difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) is considered one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China where Traditional Chinese Medicine was used for 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where Traditional Chinese Medicine was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather difficult comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number and severity of patients must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) alone with combined Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time required to restore body temperature to optimal, relieve symptoms, and hospitalize in the Western Medicine+Traditional Chinese Medicine group was significantly less than in the Western Medicine-only group.
Interestingly, the symptomatic exacerbation rate (from mild to severe) for the WM+TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine+Western Medicine) group was significantly lower than the Western Medicine-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the Western Medicine+Traditional Medicine group was also lower than the Western Medicine-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still need to be evaluated through rigorously controlled trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
Trying to determine the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or, if possible, a combination of them is interesting and tempting.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a lot of panic about this highly contagious and even deadly disease, while people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection including fever, lack of oxygen and cough, as well as side effects of treatment options including insomnia caused by corticosteroids, anxiety and psychiatric disorders can occur.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychotic states including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor neurosis, psychotic symptoms, psychosis and even suicidal thoughts were reported.
Contact tracing and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause stress and guilt in affected populations in relation to the effects of infection, quarantine and status issues for families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be available to COVID-19 patients, suspects and people who have been in contact with them, as well as the general public who need these services.
Psychological support should include the formation of multi-specialized mental health teams, transparent information with regular and accurate news about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and treatment plans, including the use of electronic devices and verbal applications for the purpose of preventing close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and human populations to susceptible hosts and are often used as a complement to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce antibodies with long-lasting activity and strong neutralization and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live diluted vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, before a clinical study can begin, the in-vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in rats and dying models and their protection against Zeonusian virus infection must be determined.
This is likely because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, isolated vertebrates and occasional clusters of Mers are still seen in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the persistence of Zeonite resources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, quasi-viral particles and neutrophil protein subunits were developed for MERS and tested in some cases on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people with low immunity is an emergency and vital to controlling the growing epidemic.
However, addressing this problem is challenging due to the long time required to design and produce a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic mutations of the coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to show its complementary clinical cycle in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without any subsequent complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with severe illness and death in severely ill patients.
Therefore, designing a disease prediction model is critical for treatment healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important predictor of SARS, as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in people aged 65-30, with 47.7% of those over 50 years of age being infected in a study involving 8,866 patients described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to suffer from chronic illness and complications and were older than those not requiring intensive care (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age may be considered a predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 per 100,000 compared to 0.27 per 100,000).
Severe illness and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute damage or cardiac arrhythmia.
Heart problems were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive clangosites, which may lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and hereditary disease are strongly correlated and may interact with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
It has been suggested that there is a correlation between CRP levels and severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also be effective in predicting outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in several tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are considered traditional markers for diagnosing heart or liver disorders.
Major clinical symptoms: To predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and the timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other relevant issues.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are commonly used as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in the fight against infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from anemia-induced osteoporosis, along with long-term disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at lower doses and for a short period of time for COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As explained above, many patients have been overly stressed by the COVID-19 outbreak, often having to observe long quarantine periods, having many doubts and suspicions about what happened, and witnessing the death of family members or close friends.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients to relieve stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted to date, COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics compared to SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract in addition to the lower respiratory tract, similar to other common cold-causing CoVs, and may be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic in the early phase of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or the commons can produce large amounts of virus during daily activities, which creates many problems for epidemic control.
However, the findings suggest that SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were in the acute phase of the disease, so most cases of transmission did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more dangerous and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Very good efforts are underway in China, including complete control of entry and exit to Wuhan and surrounding cities and ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of breaking the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused significant damage to the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, with the ongoing analysis phase lasting 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Estimates by Paul Hunter and colleagues suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic, which is significantly more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and colleagues designed a model to predict the outcome of an epidemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both sets of swab samples from subnasal cavities and throat in recovered patients who were discharged from hospital 2 weeks prior.
However, China has a promising outlook based on the reduction in the number of new cases, which implies the likely success of current strategies.
Ebola was initially projected to infect up to one million people and cause half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may gradually weaken and eventually disappear or transform into a less pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
Comparisons of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS are presented below (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and is likely to spread through direct contact with materials that infect the virus.
The virus was also found in the intestinal material, which increases the likelihood of new transmission from the intestinal-small intestine.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of those likely to have contracted the disease were hospitalized infections, including 17 patients with other illnesses and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, extreme caution and care must be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even visitors to infected patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series number 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent airborne transmission of droplets of respiratory fluid from potentially infected spines to others or from adhering to surfaces and then being passed on to others after transmission.
However, the N95 series of masks (series number 1860s) can protect you from respiratory viruses with a corrosion rate of 10 to 80 nm, a range that only 5% of viruses are able to penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with both measuring approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can be streamed even through five surgical masks, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860s) and avoid wearing surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear fully covering isolation gowns to reduce the risk of further contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; it may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use transparent face shields or glasses when treating patients.
In order to maintain public health in infected or potentially contaminated areas, it is strongly recommended that individuals wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, self-quarantine, stay at home, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The proper distance between people and the sick should be three feet.
These measures are considered effective methods to reduce and also prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered a new virus for the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was a serious warning for China, bringing to mind the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, no attempt was made to reassure the public until January 19, 2020, when the head of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control announced that the new virus had a low transmission potential and limited effective human-to-human transmission, and could be prevented and controlled.
This message made the public warning not taken seriously, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring New Year Festival, thus missing a crucial opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease on a small scale in Wuhan.
Disease control organizations in China may have learned the hard lesson and made key improvements for future action.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more careful when making public statements because any statements they make will be taken into account and could change public attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or responsible authorities; (3) be more strict in containing a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than calling for public calm; (4) provide continuous, objective and effective public information to increase public awareness of the epidemic, and periodically test and improve the community response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the perception that SARS has returned.
However, there are several distinct differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are of fundamental importance for the purpose of curbing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than young people and women, and its severity and mortality rates are still higher in older people than younger people.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the disease even when they are symptom-free, while SARS patients usually transmit when the disease is very severe, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, a routine RNA test to detect SARS-CoV-2 may be accompanied by a negative result.
On the other hand, recovered patients can become re-infected with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given this rapid rate of progress in COVID-19 research, there are still several critical unresolved issues, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus originate?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species for transmitting the virus from its primary host, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively break the chain of transmission and the outbreak may resume at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments showed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological mutations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Until these questions are clearly answered, we will not be able to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during interpersonal transmission?
Will it turn into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or re-emerge like the flu?
Finding the answer to the above question and many others is essential, but may take some time.
However, regardless of the expenditure required, our only option forward is to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal.
Animal origins of human COVs
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have contributed to the simultaneous evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common epilepsy.
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been reflected on other coins, showing the extent of damage and potential risk of a human COVID infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought the coronaviruses back into the spotlight, surprising us with their long transmission, but their pathogenicity is lower than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections have an animal origin (zoonosis), and knowing the animal origin of HCoVs can help us a lot.
Most human COVs originate from bats, which are non-pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir source hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying host animals directly helps prevent human disease.
Research on the interactions of the COV hosts in animals can provide important information about the pathogenicity in humans.
In this review study, we provide an overview of the information available on seven existing human coronaviruses, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome neutreception.
The current 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful movement between hosts and the symptoms of viral evolution over the severity of the disease also became a focus.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-stranded, subo-positive RNA coated viruses.
"The viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, were named ""CoVs (coronavirus) "" or coronaviruses because of their corona-like morphology under an electronic microscope".
Structurally, CoVs have one-piece genomes that have a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome includes two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that translate into polyprotein replicates pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1 to 16.
The protein residue of the genome includes ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), viral coating (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific secondary proteins are encoded by different forms of the coronavirus.
Due to the difference in protein sequence, CoVs are divided into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), among which the genus beta-CoV comprises the majority of human CoVs and is divided into four sub-lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma and delta coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven strains of the HCoV have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as a normal rash and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the recently identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and are more likely to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients, increasing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extraneous pulmonary symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal mucus of patients who were infected with the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained from large-scale studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until before the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infections caused by human COVs were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating of modern times, with more than 8,000 people infected and a mortality rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a sustained outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, and rare cases of it spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have animal origins in bats, mice and domestic animals.
Numerous evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all human COVs in bats, where viruses are well adapted but non-pathogenic and highly diverse.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of mutation of species.
It may also facilitate or guide research on animals that are reservoirs, intermediates and replicators of SARS-CoV-2 and be used to prevent similar cases in the future.
In this review study, we provide an overview of animal origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenicity of human COVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the conventional phenomenon that the parent HCoVs are normally nonpathogenic in their reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transfer to a new host.
We continue to examine the evolution of the HCoV, where increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, different strains of CoVs were obtained from different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, from the nasal mucus of patients who had been infected with the flu.
In the past few decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human COV detection in chronological order (Table 1) can be informative and useful.
The first HCoV-229E strain was collected in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients who had been infected with an upper respiratory tract infection, and then adapted to grow in the WI-38 respiratory cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms such as normal dizziness, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, along with fever and cough in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue transplants and subsequent transcriptional pathways in the brains of mouse cubs.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are similar in symptoms to other respiratory tract pathogens, including influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have both spread globally and are generally transmitted during the winter season and in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, and the disease is detectable for a period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a human study of volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild rash.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems developed severe infections in the lower respiratory tract.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first documented instance of a human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus discovered".
The first SARS case can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 reported cases of infection with 774 deaths and has spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from mass transmission events, it was estimated that each event could lead to approximately two episodes of secondary infection, with a common period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load that appears on day 10 of illness.
Patients who became infected with SARS-CoV first had symptoms such as muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, and then experienced shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress in the final stages.
Lymphopenia, out-of-scale liver function tests and high creatine kinase levels are common abnormal laboratory results of SARS.
In patients with SARS, cases of alveolar disseminated damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, multiple organs including the digestive system, liver, and kidney can become infected in these acute cases; the condition is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm and may be especially fatal in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a symptomatic patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many attempts to research the human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first observed to be common among young children, deaf people and patients with weakened immune systems or respiratory disease.
Rash, inflammation, fever and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63-induced illness.
Another independent study describes isolating a similar virus from a nasal mucus sample from an 8-month-old child with chest and armpit disease in the Netherlands.
Although the case was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of all respiratory illnesses, with its peak prevalence in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 has also been linked to obstructive laryngitis, also known as laryngitis.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong with bronchiolitis.
In addition to pulmonary bronchitis and bronchiolitis with mass outbreaks, an association of HCoV-HKU1 with acute asthma exacerbation has also been reported.
HCoV-HKU1, along with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were identified worldwide as causing mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs with mass transmission were well adapted to humans and generally have a lower mutation probability of causing disease with long pathogenicity, although rare cases of a higher pathogenicity subtype of HCoV-NL63 have been reported for unknown reasons, most recently in severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain their continuity in humans, their infectivity or pathogenicity decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old lethargic patient with acute chest and hip dysfunction.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, several imported cases and occasional secondary outbreaks have been observed in European countries and Tunisia due to close contact.
A second-degree outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by a progressive acute thoracic outbreak.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have severe pollen deficiency, which is unique to MERS among human coronavirus outbreaks.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a very high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of chest and ankle-infected patients were observed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who are now identified as having been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, causes severe respiratory infections that manifest themselves in fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Chest and hip is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% long nucleotide sequence homology, they are in two different clusters of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to accelerating its spread worldwide.
Comparing and finding differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six other human coronaviruses shows a number of interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 mimics the general pattern of six other human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coVs with a mass transmission (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are more commonly seen during infections with human COVs in the mass outbreak, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases may also be considered as a sample of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission continues to show interesting patterns that are indicative of both human coVs with mass transmission and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of other human co-CoVs with high prevalence.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to different humans after infection is reduced, as happened for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in infected samples as can other human CoVs.
Whether SARS-CoV-2's transmission through the gut-gut interface plays a role similar to that of SARS-CoV, at least under certain conditions, is still unclear.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonal patterns, as with the cases of human CoVs with mass outbreaks.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission, will influence the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs with mass outbreaks that cause mild symptoms of disease have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may still be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and humans who have developed severe HCoV illness were excluded from the study.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host-limiting factors.
In this case, the more persistent the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak becomes and the more people infected, the greater the chance the virus will become complementary to humans.
If the virus adapts well, it is difficult to prevent transmission by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four coronaviruses have been circulating with mass outbreaks in the human population, causing normal seizures in people with normal immune function.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the long-pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses have not adapted well to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be stable.
They must maintain and reproduce themselves in animal tanks, usually through one or more intermediate and reproductive hosts, seeking an opportunity to transmit to sensitive human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human co-infections with mass transmission.
Like HCoVs with mass transmission, it is highly transmissible, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than the mass-spread coronavirus, but it is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it is fully adapted to humans and can move between humans without the need for a reservoir or intermediate animal host will be determined in the future.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it is best to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and replicator HCoV hosts.
An animal is considered an evolutionary host of a human COV if it is a close ancestor and has high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the reservoir host maintains the HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts become naturally infected and act as the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the HCoV is recently, prior to or approximately at the same time as introduction to humans, transmitted to an intermediate host, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
An intermediate host can act as an animal source for human infection and act as a replicator host that allows the virus to temporarily multiply and then be transmitted to humans to increase the scale of infection in humans.
A human COV will terminate as a deadly infection if it cannot maintain transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to an intermediate host and even cause long-term native disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
A review of epidemiological data found that the SARS case had a history of contact with prey animals.
Subsequent studies of the serum outbreak showed that the prevalence of immunoglobulin G against SARS-CoV was higher in animal traders than in the general public.
The masked palm frog (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were first identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV in live animal markets.
This was proven indirectly by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after all the bats in the market were killed.
However, reported masked palm civets in the wild or on farms that did not have contact with live animal markets were generally negative for SARS-CoV infection, in other words, it can be concluded that masked palm civets may merely act as a host medium for virus replication, rather than a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that, since 80 percent of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may act as intermediate reproductive hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
It is apparent that all of these are the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a very close-in bat CoV, the HKU3-related bat CoV Rhinolophus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), present in Chinese horse-toed bats.
The antibody test for SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence were positive in these bats.
This and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies established a new concept, which means that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none of them can be isolated as live viruses except for a virus called WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was found to use bat, zebra, and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, serum from patients recovering from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has shown the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology shared.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a parent virus intermediate for SARS-CoV and that bats are not the first reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV into the same bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 groups.
Both bat-CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences for MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the bat-like variants of the coronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, no MERS-CoV has been found alive in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat relative CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the same nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the first reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that dromedary camels, especially MERS-CoV-specific serum neutralising antibodies, are positive, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin found in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoVs similar to the virus found in humans were taken from a camel's nose sample, suggesting that camels are the true reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is important to note that generally, camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had mild but severe viral replication symptoms.
It is important to note that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the gut-smelling tract, which is the main mode of transmission of the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many MERS cases had no prior contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, so it is possible that the disease was transmitted from person to person or through unknown methods and animal species that were carriers of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shows nucleotide homology to 96.2% with bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to be considered a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the first hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir unless similar bat coVs are found in the future.
It is likely that the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 intermediates must have been among the wildlife species that were sodas and killed in the Hunan seafood wholesale market, a category that many early COVID-19 cases were associated with, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several new studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of endangered small mammals called pangolins (Manis javanica) could also be the ancestral source of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
These new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% in terms of nucleotide sequence levels.
They form two sub-lines of SARS-CoV-like viruses in the cluster phylogenetic tree, which share a greater similarity in receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs have greater variation, although they have greater sequence homology in terms of genomics.
A previous study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contagion from lung samples that were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different collection methods and manual selection to create a partial genome sequence that covered about 86.3% of the full length of the viral genome.
The possibility that pangolins are one of the animal intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, currently, there is no evidence of a direct pangolin origin for SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta coronaviruses in pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals must be determined.
While the highest homology matching in RBDs was found between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 related beta-CoVs share the highest homology sequence sharing at the genome level.
The high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoV-RBDs in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be due to convergent evolution with a selection intermediate.
A mutual suggestion in favor of neutrophils is a beta-pancillin coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in a third wild species.
Nootropics are promoted as an evolutionary driver among beta-COVIDs.
The indirect animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation and cannot be stated with certainty.
In addition to highly pathogenic human CoVs, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified in North American three-toed bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camels are thought to be intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known human COVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of human COVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 was found to have interspecies transmission from domestic animals to humans in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well understood.
Bat alpha coVs were found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Among them is an alpaca alpha coronavirus.
Numerous evidence supports the importance of direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans may have come into contact with bats, not alpacas, because of their presence in a common ecological niche.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the bat-related alpha CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and noninfectious in bats, while the alpha Alpaca CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, no cases of alpaca alphaCoV have been observed in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may be infected with HCoV-229E-related alpha coronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, although bat-alpha CoV acts as the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and mountain camels can act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as happened with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain camels and later from mountain camels to humans.
Initial identification of MERS-CoV identified bats as the origin of the disease evolution, and subsequent findings confirmed this.
It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic material and interspecies transmission.
"Long life spans, crowded colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly all provide favorable conditions for bats as ideal ""virus carriers""".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been localized in camels for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels, changing from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and has relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Scattered transmission to humans is a random event, and humans are the host of the MERS-CoV stalemate as transmission between humans cannot continue.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins - if they have any role at all - in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoVs in pangolins are highly pathogenic.
They may host a stack of SARS-CoV-2 alpha coronaviruses, similar to the spores associated with SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats can be the reservoir hosts of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats by working in slaughterhouses or mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate replicator hosts that have recently been introduced by SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected by butchering and eating hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic and domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A study in domestic and wild animals is needed to test for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, the neutrophils and adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, there are three main factors of the virus that facilitate the crossing of interspecies barriers for the coronavirus.
First of all, they have relatively high rates of genetic mutation during RNA replication.
"Compared to other single stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate for CoVs can be considered ""medium"" to ""high"" based on an average replacement rate of approximately 104 replacements per year at site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts".
The coronavirus has an unreadable exoribonuclease, and its removal can lead to a very high mutation and debilitation or even its extinction.
Interestingly, a nucleotide analogue called remdesivir is known to suppress the process of COV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Redsevir is one of the best drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 that should be clinically tested.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are usually high when the coronavirus has not adapted well to the host.
Compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host that is related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is true for MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to monkey camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will be able to rapidly neutralize vaccines and antivirals for SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses provides greater flexibility in genome modification for mutations or neutrecyclization, resulting in increased probability of interspecies coevolution, which contributes to the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, the coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly convert patterns during RNA replication via a ""copy selection"" mechanism".
In the host that acts as the mixer, string conversion occurs frequently during transcription of the coronavirus RNA.
RNAs with long hemologues and complementary and subgenomic lengths can be combined to produce new coronaviruses.
Evidence of natural phylogenetic neutrecyclicity was observed in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Interaction between host and virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV neutrophil is considered a prominent example and has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Comparative analysis of human and zebrafish SARS-CoV isolates shows that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different hosts, especially through mutations in RBD and S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of a COV interacts with the cell receptor and is highly selective in response to host antibodies.
The RBD in SARS-CoV is located on amino acids 318-510 on the S1 segment, which causes human ACE2 to bind as well as common receptors for virus entry.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding domain is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, bats, mice and dog raccoons, making interspecies transmission possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to have different RBD between viruses isolated from humans and spiders, and 4 of them were located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The SARS-CoV Zbad has two mutations, K479N and S487T, in its RBD, which may increase the dependence of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can play a vital role in viral adaptation to humans.
It is important to note that the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is identical to that of SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the tendency to bind its S protein to human ACE2 is likely to be altered.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed a 10-20 times higher affinity for this linkage than for the linkage between ACE2 and S protein in SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether other helper receptors are necessary for transmission compared to the high mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but with a different S-receptor.
There are many other human COV receptors, including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
This may explain the success of adapting these CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is influenced by host dependencies and other limiting factors.
The differentiation of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, mountain camels and rodents can form a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For a successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must take host-dependent factors and suppress host-limiting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction must be identified and characterized.
A genome-wide, unbiased screening of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2, using advanced CRISPR technology, may be fruitful.
Emergence of new human coronaviruses: Back to square one
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
Based on this, bat CoVs act as the genetic source of human CoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic neutrecycling also contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of the HCoV, and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could potentially modify viral phenotypes significantly.
Among SARS-CoV secondary proteins, ORF8 appears to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses were isolated, but it was found that ORF8 proteins encode for Wagra.
A feature of deleting the 29-nucleotide of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated races at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is a type of adaptive mutation that facilitates translocation between hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV likely had a history of neutrophils between the alpha and gamma lineages of the coronavirus, according to which a large number of smaller neutrophil segments were identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Neutrophil positions in nsp9, the bulk of nsp10, and parts of nsp14 were also identified.
Similarly, in the MERS-CoV epidemic, cases of neutrophils between different lineages were observed in the camels of a cohoun in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, neutrophilic events have also been observed in other human CoVs in which human CoVs neutrophilic with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintended mutations in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the release of viruses from selective pressures, for example from the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete length loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strand due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although healthy ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha CoV has a nucleotide sequence that causes a mutation that converts the reading frame.
Recently, the evolution of emerging HCoVs has also been driven by selective pressures in their reservoir hosts.
When bats were infected with the coronavirus, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases were identified, indicating a bilateral adaptation between the coronaviruses and bats.
This means that the bats adapted well to the coronavirus, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in the activation of the primary inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the pathology activated by the coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to elevated production of natural killer cell receptor inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and low expression of class-A major tissue adaptation complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of active oxygen-containing compounds (ROS) resulting from the high metabolic activity of bats can simultaneously suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the top of the sample by exoribonuclease, resulting in selective pressure to produce virus strains that have high side effects when introduced to a new host.
CoV strains with higher pathogenicity also evolve by neutrophil synthesis, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause very mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They multiply violently without creating a strong immune response from the host.
There are still puzzles as to why asymptomatic vectors are seen and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are usually due to overactivation of the immune system response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response to the coronavirus replication is isolated.
The same strategy for isolating immune response may have positive effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of interferon type I should be useful at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is impaired.
With this logic, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general pattern as that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although the beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV that has 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While zebras and other animals on the market are known to host SARS-CoV-like viruses, the first intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.
The newly discovered pangolin beta coVs, which are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggest that it is possible that pangolins acted as one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta coV may have played a role in the genetic fragments that made the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally made by humans.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and animal reservoir of human CoVs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from human-to-human contact in the marketplace, closing trading markets and killing bats could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With this logic, given the discovery that several lineages of the pangolin beta-CoV are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be collected from farmers' markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other animals and how it is transmitted will be determined in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in mountain camels for a long time.
Camels are an important means of transportation and also a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local populations.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, sacrificing all camels to control MERS, similar to what happened to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Chinese market wildlife, is practically impossible.
To stop the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective vaccines to combat MERS-CoV in camels is needed, including all necessary measures to control infection.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
Several types of animal HCoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat HCoVs are highly diverse with the potential to be transmitted from animals to humans.
There are many opportunities for these animal CoVs to evolve or become neutrophilic, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that may be more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be put to rest to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In view of the disasters caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan must be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are trained to stay away from these animals.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of the coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-to-human transmission is to keep humans away from natural reservoirs of animal-to-human viruses.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, the mode of human-bat contact must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be determined how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be established.
Whether it occurs in a bat, a pangolin, or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses, which are almost identical, are expected to be found in their natural host in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important implications for COVID-19 prevention and control in humans.
"Updating the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for ""suspected case"" and ""confirmed case"" is essential".
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, which provides a good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience.
In this letter, we responded to a comment about our guide and provided the latest confirmed and suspected diagnostic criteria according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) led to an outbreak of a pandemic disease now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is now officially named Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, were published in a total of seven editions, with some provisions substantially changed.
Now that our guideline has received feedback from Xu and colleagues, they have proposed a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and continues to provide valuable clues to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their remarkable efforts and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment procedures (trial 7th edition) and recent studies, their work also needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, each of the epidemiological history features must be combined with two clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical symptoms in the absence of an epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with cluster of confirmed cases (2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred during the week in small areas such as home, work, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) have imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count, reduced in the early onset normal count category, or reduced lymphocytes.
A confirmed diagnosis must be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological events: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a total viral genome sequence showing high homogeneity with the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive result for a specific IgM antibody and an IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a positive conversion of a SARS-CoV-2 assigned IgG antibody from negative to positive or a tetral increase of 4 times or more in the recovery phase above such a value in the acute phase.
We can see that the instant PCR test, for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood sample, has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These improvements are based on the researchers' ongoing efforts to find an optimal nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory system including blood sampling, which led to the emergence of validated criteria with increased availability of different samples and greater support for relying on a positive antibody result.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to be cautious with patients with unusual or no symptoms.
The flow chart of Zhou and colleagues should therefore be updated, as they classified individuals without clinical symptoms as low-risk.
The scoring system should also be validated in further clinical procedures and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to have more direct evidence and invite readers to provide their comments.
For diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that they follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also update guidance to provide assistance in a timely manner.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day figure.
Yesterday, Bangladesh declared five feet of poverty in one day due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 cases of infection and 33 cases of complementary recovery at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director, Dr. Mirjad Sabrina Flora, said the dead were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjaddi, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 years old, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency that one of the detainees was Jalal Sifoor Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitreya Hospital.
Obid al-Qadir, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, said in an online video statement on Saturday that civil transport will be on a break longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The civil transportation holiday program began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on March 8, involving two people who had returned from Italy, and the wife of one of the two was also infected.
On March 19, all three had recovered.
Infections with SARS-CoV-2 have exceeded one million worldwide.
On Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus-related illness.
The milestone was the day Malawi announced its first coronavirus case and Zambia reported its first case.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus cases.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 105,163 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus were reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBC News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 people died of coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries are taking specific measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

Stores in Australia lowered the limit on the sale of toilet towels per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Walworth and Coles reduced their paper towel purchase quotas to two and one pack per purchase, respectively, in all stores across the country.
ALDI announced a one-package purchase limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as a message at the checkout counter and on the store's Facebook page.
It has been reported that shoppers are stockpiling soda due to fears of COVID-19 and isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper to one package per order for home delivery.
These changes followed four previous transaction-per-restriction packages introduced on March 4 and 5, respectively, by Woolworths and Coles.
"Coles Supermarkets reported in a media interview on March 8 that, despite a four-pack limit, ""many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery"", calling demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI chain stores, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called the sales ""unexpected"".
"Selling rose ""steeply"" according to a Walworth spokesman".
Costco's Canberra store also limited the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery times, Wal-Worth ordered more from stock, and Aldi pre-ordered for Wednesday's special offer.
Rachel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local authorities' restrictions on truck hours made it difficult.
He expects production costs to be higher, as suppliers struggle to meet demand and have fewer special cases.
On Tuesday, ALDI (chain stores) announced that following the early release of stock, some stores could not have Wednesday special sales.
In a News.com.au report, retail expert Dr. Gary Mortimer of Queensland University of Technology said stores fill up every night.
He noted that toilet towels are bulky goods that take up little space in a lot of space.
Rachel Zimmerman told ABC News, "Coles and Walworth believe that if there are enough items on the shelves, if there is and can be enough supply of products like toilet paper and disinfectant, you can probably minimize this buying panic".
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, said it had run out of stock on Wednesday.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Clinix toilet towels, and Solaris Paper, the manufacturer of Sorbent, stressed that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet market demand.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when buyers are on vacation due to the long Labor Day holiday and fewer auctions are held, some property sellers give free toilet paper to the first bidder at Melbourne auctions.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper published in Darwin, included an eight-page appendix printed for use as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, stating that they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added: "Other products such as masks, disinfectants, dryers, powders and hand washing fluids are in high demand.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed that on Sunday evening, the British online supermarket Okado limited the purchase of toilet towels to two 12-pack.
WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus a pandemic.
"Although the word ""pandemic"" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread and does not indicate the degree of risk of specific cases, the World Health Organization noted the need to push governments to: ""
"All countries can still reverse the course of this pandemic".
Tedros Adhanom, head of the World Health Organization, believes that "if countries respond to the need to diagnose, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize people, they will respond".
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of outbreak and severity of the disease as well as the alarming levels of negligence. """
"According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was ""unprecedented""".
"In a statement released to CNN in February, he said, ""Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been identified from the onset of symptoms to a continuing global outbreak"".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: "We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic before.
He continued, ""We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time"".
The new status of a pandemic follows the decision of the World Health Organization in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement about the outbreak, ""The situation is going to get worse".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2020-2019 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the acute chronic respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a national public health emergency of concern on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing almost 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, however, globally it varies from 13.4% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications of the disease include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for the disease.
Primary care is a form of symptomatic treatment and supportive care.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, and screening and quarantining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to travel restrictions, quarantines, restrictions on movement, workplace risk control and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources caused by panic shopping.
Schools and universities are closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has been published online, and cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of ethnicity and appearance from East and Southeast Asia, and other regions that have seen high cases of the virus, have been reported.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province), reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and investigations began in early January 2020.
The patients were mainly in contact with the wholesale seafood market in Hunan, so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic (common human-animal disease) origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus with features very similar to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later found to have been infected on December 1, 2019, and had no apparent contact with the seafood market cluster.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the case detected on 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province may be the first case of infection.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases in China declined, in Italy, Iran and South Korea, cases had increased sharply, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases in China for the first time.
Important reports may not be reported in a complementary manner, especially in cases with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of the disease have been reported among younger people, with only 2.4% of all cases worldwide being people aged 19 and under.Patrick Vallance, senior scientific adviser to the UK government, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected with the virus to achieve mass immunity.
The cases are from a population that has been tested for COVID-19 and tested positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been to refuse to test people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that in China, as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline replication rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported it at 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from onset of symptoms to death varied between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 feet have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had previous underlying conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official cases of COVID-19 pandemic deaths have generally been reported in deceased people whose COVID-19 test was declared positive according to official protocols.
The actual COVID-19 death toll is much higher because it does not include people who die without testing, for example at home or in nursing homes.
Preliminary data from Italy indicate that the number of deaths from the pandemic is 5-4 times the official COVID-19 death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the figure] is lower than the actual figure". Narrated reports of unrealistic numbers in the US confirm these statements.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside the Asian continent on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen cases of foot-and-mouth disease had been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than 40 countries and territories, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and are influenced by factors such as the number of tests performed, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, the length of time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and public health.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global death-to-incidence ratio is 6% (970,039 out of 1617,204).
The figures vary by region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (individuals with onset of symptoms for January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (individuals with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020).The other calculations include: CFR (diagnosed mortality rate) and IFR (diagnosed and undiagnosed mortality rate).
These statistics have no time limit and are a function of a particular community from infection to recovery.
A number of university researchers have attempted to calculate this number for a particular population.
The Oxford University Center for Applied Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the effect of this test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization acknowledged that the global pandemic is under control.
The peak of the outbreak and the final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University admitted that if left unchecked, the prevalence of infectious diseases normally remains unchanged over time and declines after the end of the host.
"But at present, any kind of reasonable prediction regarding when the disease will end is almost impossible"".
"The Chinese government's top medical adviser, Zhong Nan Shan, said that if all countries can mobilize everyone to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, ""it could be over by June"".
" On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""is spreading and will likely persist for one or two years"".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (about 18 months or more).
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, ""I believe it is unlikely that the virus will completely disappear - because it is so contagious"" and ""it could become a seasonal disease that re-emerges every year"".
The severity of the virus's re-infection depends on herd immunity and mutation rate.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms with lower incidence include fatigue, respiratory cramping (concussion), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, bloody vomiting, diarrhea or cyanosis.The World Health Organization states that almost one in six people become seriously ill and experience shortness of breath.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines emergency symptoms as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure sensation, sudden confusion, difficulty waking from sleep, and bruising of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, urgent medical attention is recommended.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic and not show clinical symptoms, but test results confirm their infection, so researchers recommend that people who have been in close contact with these cases be carefully monitored and examined to prevent the spread of infection.
The proportion of asymptomatic patients in China was estimated at fractions of 44%.
The incubation period usually varies from one to fourteen days; in most cases, it is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated fraction of COVID-19 infected people who have lost their sense of smell has decreased from 30% initially and then to 15%.
Some details about the outbreak have been recently revealed.
It is believed that in the early stages, the virus spreads through close contact with droplets that are produced when coughing, sneezing or talking, provided that close contact is between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that when coughing without a cover, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by tiny droplets of fluid, which are dispersed when speaking and remain suspended in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets may be dispersed when breathing and speaking, although the virus is not normally dispersed through the air.
These droplets may enter the mouth or nose of those close to us and be absorbed into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be dispersed into the air, resulting in airborne emissions.
If you touch an infected surface such as skin and then touch your eyes, nose, and mouth, the disease can spread.
While there are concerns about the spread of the virus through feces, this risk is not considered serious.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of FMD-transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms begin, although it may spread to others before symptoms begin and during the final stages of the disease.
Tests have been positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting transmission before significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, an infected person can usually infect two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been observed to be detectable for more than three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Tests for COVID-19 in pets and other animals have been positive.
There is no documented evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend that you wash your hands after contact with animals, as you would when touching other infected surfaces.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first identified in three people with chest and abdominal disease in Wuhan who had low blood oxygen levels and respiratory problems.
All the characteristics of the novel coronavirus occur in all natural coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus is killed with ordinary soap, as its protective layer dissolves in soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have a zoonotic origin or common human-animal disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronaviruses genetically form a cluster with the genus Betacoronavirus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B-virus) along with two strains of bat origin.
The virus has a 96% similarity at the genome level to other bat-type coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in certain areas of the genome sequence, there is only one amino acid difference between pangolin viruses and human ones.
Comparing the entire genome to date, 92% of the shared genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not sufficient to prove pangolins as intermediate hosts.
A viral infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although definitive diagnosis is confirmed by reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (Rrt-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with CT scan (CT) in Wuhan showed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specialized and many of its imaging features overlap with other types of breast and hip and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CTs should not be used for screening or testing for COVID-19 first-line diagnostics"".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on samples of breath or blood.
Results are usually provided within a few hours to a few days.
The test is generally performed with a nasopharyngeal tube, although a throat tube may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been sufficiently accurate for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been authorized for emergency use only by authorized laboratories.
Imaging characteristics in radiological images and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms included round glass cortices and no motion fusions were observed.
The Italian Association of Radiology is compiling an online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Because of its co-occurrence with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without final PCR confirmation is limited for COVID-19 diagnosis.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR, showing that although imaging for this infection is less common, it is sensitive and fast and can be used in epidemic areas as a screening tool.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks were developed to identify the visual features of the virus in radiological and CT images.
Strategies to prevent transmission include general personal hygiene, hand washing, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing in a towel, and quickly throwing the towel in the trash.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the virus outbreak.
However, in large parts of the world, the virus has reached a phase of community spread.
This means that the virus is spreading between communities and some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Care providers who may be caring for an infected person are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Tracing contact records of an infected person is an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, prompting Amnesty International, along with more than 100 other organizations, to issue a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance measures.
Several mobile phone applications have been deployed or offered for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log in to phones with users close together.
Users then receive a message asking if they have recently been in direct contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are common, for example, rinsing the nose and throat with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, various organizations are working to achieve it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are obviously dirty; before eating; after flushing, coughing, or sneezing.
Because the virus is killed outside the human body with ordinary soap, soap removes its protective coating.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you do not have access to soap and water.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (one minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate are less effective.
According to CDC recommendations, if a person is suspected of having COVID or has been confirmed in a location such as a clinic or treatment center, all areas such as clinics, health services, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by patients should also be cluttered.
Health activists have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a towel or elbow when coughing or sneezing and immediately throw away their paper towels.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected because masks can reduce the volume and distance of respiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
" According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is the main cause of infection transmission, by sitting with their hands"" Masks are also recommended for people caring for suspected cases of illness. "
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, for example, caring for people with COVID-19, although it acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical facial masks made of fabric.China in particular recommends the use of single-use medical masks for healthy people in the community, especially in close contact of 1 meter (3 feet or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks in public transport or crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to produce fabric face masks at home and wash their clothes daily.
The Czech Republic has banned public use of masks or mouth and nose coverings.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made wearing a mask mandatory for those entering grocery stores.
Israel has required all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has reached a production capacity of ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made the use of masks mandatory for passengers on railway and intercity bus fleets from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a mask is mandatory when going out, and those who cannot afford a face mask must produce one at home.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures that are implemented with the aim of reducing illness by minimizing contact between people.
The measures include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, sports stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can maintain social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless phones and maintaining social distancing.
Many governments have already mandated or recommended social distancing in quarantined areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population in communities recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States dropped rapidly from 250 (provided there are no COVID-19 outbreaks in the area) to 50 and then to 10.
"As of March 22, 2020, Germany has banned gatherings of more than two people. People with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems are at high risk of this acute disease and its complications, and should stay at home as much as possible in areas of mass outbreaks, according to CDC recommendations.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations replaced the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"" to indicate that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining virtual or remote social contact".
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has replaced the notion that people should participate in complementary social isolation and not encourage them to connect with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual hygiene guidelines during the pandemic".
These include recommending that sexual activity be limited to a partner who does not have symptoms of the virus.
Individuals with COVID-19 and those suspected of infection have been advised to self-quarantine.
Health organizations have provided detailed procedures for proper self-isolation.Many governments have made self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for all populations in infected areas.
The most severe self-quarantine orders have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a widespread outbreak are advised to self-quarantine for up to 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
Strategies to control the spread of a disease include restricting or mitigating and reducing the rate of outbreaks.
Restrictions are imposed in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating infected individuals, as well as introducing other disease control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to others.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the onset of the disease, efforts go into a reduction phase: measures are taken to slow the spread of the virus and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of restrictive and mitigating measures may be applied simultaneously.
Suppression of the disease requires more drastic measures to bring the baseline pandemic replication rate below 1. Part of pandemic management is to lower the peak of the pandemic, also called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-drug interventions that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face masks and quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling public events; public participation to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries also took various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has resorted to public screening and local quarantines, and warned against the movement and movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support for infected cases who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on people who ignored quarantine.
Taiwan increased mask production and imposed heavy fines for medical equipment withholding.Simulations with the UK and US showed that epidemic mitigation (slowing down rather than stopping the pace of the epidemic) and mitigation (reversing the pace of the epidemic) pose major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health services by two thirds and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overcapacity of health systems.
Suppression can be maintained, but it must continue as long as the virus is circulating between humans (or until a vaccine is developed, whichever comes first), otherwise, once some of the strict measures are eased, the virus will re-spike and spread.
Long-term interventions to combat the pandemic will entail social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking anti-seizure medications without a prescription, drinking fluids and resting can be effective in relieving symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment with oxygen, intravenous fluids and assisted breathing may be necessary.
Steroid use may exacerbate the complications of the disease.
Several drug combinations that were previously effective in treating other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional remedies" can reduce the complications of SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and implementation of healthcare to address the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the World Health Organization's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care and health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures where possible, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of air conditioners and beds.
There are various theories regarding the identity of the first infected person (called Patient Zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei and China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were sold, and one theory is that the virus originated from these species; in other words, it is zoonotic in origin.A cluster of pneumonia with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, and the matter was reported to the Wuhan Xianang Disease Control Center on December 27.
"On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a "" SARS-like coronavirus. """
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were questioned by police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, named Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alert level.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
A significant number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan in early January, prompting the start of investigations.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is one of the main transportation hubs and railway junctions.

On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a global pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that the WHO is "really concerned about the alarming levels of outbreak and severity and the alarming levels of negligence".

A number of state executives of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for their management of the quarantine effort in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some critics believe that the move was to protect the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, from public anger at him during the coronavirus epidemic.
Some high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, ignored early awareness of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, fueling US and Italian conspiracy theories about China as the root cause of the COVID-19 outbreak.
"The Donald Trump administration in the US referred to the coronavirus as ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"" and said it was ""censorship, causing a viral outbreak that has now become a global pandemic"" which in turn has been criticized by some critics as racism and ""distracting attention from the ineffectiveness of his administration in containing the disease""".
"The Daily Beast has obtained a cable network for communication measures from the National Security Council, which uses a strategy known as ""everything is under China""".
"We are urged to do our utmost to get this message out to the public in any way possible, including through news conferences and television interviews. ""News agencies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of its propaganda for global influence".
"Joseph Borel, EU foreign policy officer, warned ""there is a geopolitical component that includes attempts to influence through distraction and 'generous policies.'""
Borel also stated that ""China is desperately looking to show everyone that, unlike the United States, it is a committed and reliable partner"."

On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent the Russian military to Italy to send military medicines, special disinfectants and other medical equipment.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous ""high-level political source"" as saying that 80% of Russian aid ""was useless or of little use to Italy"".
The source accused Russia of abusing ""geopolitical and diplomatic"" conditions with its deceptive and insulting action.
Attilio Fontana, Lombardy's president, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media report and praised the efforts.
Russia sent a medical aid aircraft to the United States.
"Dmitry Pushkov, a Kremlin spokesman, stated ""When we offered assistance to our colleagues in the United States, we assumed that once the manufacturers of medical equipment and products in the United States resume their work, they will also be able to reciprocate their help if necessary""".

"" The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with nearly 24 lawmakers and 15 other current or former political figures infected".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent an open letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying his country was struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal childcare, family leave with pay and higher public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that the virus pandemic could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election and relations between Japan and South Korea.
"After Japan announced that it would quarantine all incoming travelers from South Korea for two weeks in government-designated locations, South Korea criticized Japan for ""vague and passive recognition of quarantine efforts""".
The South Korean people were initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed leaflets demanding Moon's ouster, praising what they claimed was the government's ineffectiveness in curbing the outbreak, or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to enact emergency laws to implement a proper response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may lead governments to hold on to power more tightly.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who spread misinformation about the virus and government crisis management.
The coronavirus outbreak was caused by several instances of a shortage of supplies, which was caused by increased use of coronavirus containment equipment, fear of buying and disruption in factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption in suppliers.
Several areas also saw a public outpouring of shopping, leading to empty store shelves of essential goods such as food, toiletries and bottled water, leading to a shortage of supply.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipping electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Secretary-General of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to price increases of up to twenty times the usual price and caused delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the World Health Organization has warned that it will put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego sellers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets, and as a result, the Australian government banned it. Despite high COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the resulting high demand for food, neither region suffered a severe food loss.
China and Italy's measures to combat the monopoly and smuggling of essential products have been successful, preventing the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in the northern regions of Italy, which produce the majority of agricultural products, has not declined significantly, but prices may rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Empty shelves of food even in Wuhan only appeared temporarily, while top Chinese officials opened pork stores to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to stockpile for such occasions.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, China's economy suffered a severe hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to prevent the outbreak of the virus, with retail sales falling 20.5%.
Since mainland China is one of the main economic and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak is a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Information Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until the status of potential outcomes became clearer.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth may be greater than the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
According to an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, the global supply chain will be affected by up to $300 billion, which will last for up to two years.
"According to reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), oil prices have ""faced a serious decline"" due to declining Chinese demand".
Global stock markets plunged on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak led to unprecedented declines in the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average stock indexes, which were the biggest one-day falls since the 2007 financial crisis, with the Dow Jones Corporation scoring 1,191 points.
All three indicators were down more than 10% at the end of the week.
On 28 February, the rating agency GMBH Scope confirmed China's credit rating but had a negative outlook.
Stocks fell sharply again due to coronavirus fears, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many consider recession to be a possibility.
Mohamed al-Arian, an economist, appreciated the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and countries.
Central banks reacted more quickly than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places such as tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to travel to other countries, the tourism industry is among the hardest hit.
As a result, several airlines have canceled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while UK regional carrier Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise ship industry was unprecedented.
Several train stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the main travel season, which is related to the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments canceled a number of events such as the New Year's Eve celebrations, which were crowded, and private companies independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, district and regional authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to open on that date.
These regions represented 80% of domestic production and 90% of export output.
Hong Kong raised its response level to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America have declined by 40 percent.
Middle East and North America retail saw a 50 to 60 percent drop in sales.
This also led to a sharp decline in shopping in stores in March compared to February.
Operators of major shopping malls around the world took complementary measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling events.The UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the recession caused by the pandemic will cause absolute poverty for 14 to 22 million people in Latin America, more than the number without the pandemic.
During the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan in January and February 2020, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck at home in remote provinces or in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could affect up to 47 million jobs in the United States and raise the unemployment rate to 32%. Complementary quarantine in India has led to ten million Indian migrant workers (who work on a wage basis) being unemployed. Results of a survey by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44% of Canadian families were somehow unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit (Universal Credit).
The German Short-Term Work Compensation Scheme has also been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were severely affected by the negative aspects of the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and individuals, both employees and freelancers, worldwide.
Organizations in the cultural and artistic sectors tried to support their mission (often with public funding) to make cultural heritage accessible to the public, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions around the world, with varying degrees of severity, were closed indefinitely, along with their exhibitions, events and performances that were cancelled or postponed.
In response, many efforts have also been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerating step in disease reduction is the cancellation of religious events, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been hit hard.The Vatican announced that the Holy Week ritual in Rome, which was to be observed during the Christian fasting week last week, has also been canceled.
Many bishops have advised elderly Christians to stay home instead of attending services on Sundays; some churches have broadcast services via radio, online streaming, or television, while others recommend private services.
As the bishop of the Roman Catholic Church closed its churches, large and small, and St. Peter's Square was cleared of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions canceled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced that Friday prayers in infected areas will be canceled and religious sites will continue to be closed due to the outbreak, while Saudi Arabia has banned its citizens from visiting the holy sites in Mecca and Medina while preventing foreign pilgrims from entering.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
"The outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event ""will be moved to a date other than 2020 but not beyond summer 2021". "Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed, and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or canceled".
This has led to many gamblers turning to online gambling, and many online gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their site visits. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several bands suspending or cancelling their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including those on Broadway, also suspended all screenings.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances such as live-streamed concerts or creating web-based ""internet festivals"" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online coronavirus trolls are spreading to distract and make fun of these blacks.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a lot of negative prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese and East Asian people and against people in high-infection rates in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and violence have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) showed racist sentiments among numerous groups around the world that the Chinese people deserved the virus and what was claimed as punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because they were from the region.
There have been online and offline donations from areas affected by the virus in China.
Following the spread of the disease in countries with high new outbreaks, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, may continue to be exposed to suspicion and xenophobia among citizens in other countries.Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed leaflets banning Chinese nationals from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported increasing levels of racist insults and attacks.
" President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as ""Chinese virus"", a term that critics see as a sign of racism and anti-Chinese sentiment. "
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan and transferred to Novi Senzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in major cities in India reported being terrified and anxious about the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing in South Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them".
"These remarks were later condemned and called ""erroneous"" by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens have intensified after the pandemic, and foreign nationals have been considered ""foreign trash"" or told to be thrown in the ""garbage bin""".
Many newspapers with paid sections have removed these sections to cover news related to the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the outbreak of the virus available to the public free of charge.
Some scientists decided to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes two methods, methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods that detect the presence of antibodies produced in response to the presence of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This is a specific test and is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA only.
It is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both disease diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody testing shows how many people were infected, including those with symptoms so mild that they did not need to be reported or who did not have any symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity levels in the population can be determined using the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population until March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
Convergence is also likely to have a significantly higher impact on reported deaths, which in some countries are likely to be significantly over-optimistically estimated.
With the help of reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal or sputum samples.
Results are usually announced after a few hours or up to 2 days at most.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat samples taken in the first week of illness are reliable.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, although it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For cases of infection tested in the second week, the sample material can be obtained by bottom-up respiration via a suction catheter or exudation of mucus (diversion).
One of the first PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 by Charité in Berlin, which used the reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and provided the basis for the development of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has also developed a test by 23 January 2020. Kogenebiotech in South Korea also produced a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, PowerChek Coronavirus, on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Organization of China for a PCR-based detection kit for SARS-CoV-2. In the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is making its Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) available to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits remained incomplete due to a defect in the identifier, causing trials at the CDC in Atlanta to suffer; this caused the number of samples successfully evaluated to decline by an average of 100 per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not established until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing on that date.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing it in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests are available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing kits available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quarantine restrictions have been announced; sample collection and analysis must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours and in high volume, resulting in a machine capable of performing approximately 4,128 tests every 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued a similar authorization for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the Food and Drug Administration for a 45-minute trial.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid enhancement technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a set of alternating temperature cycles, the method can determine a positive result in just 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day soon.A trial is currently underway in Taiwan that uses monoclonal antibodies, a substance that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of new coronaviruses; this type of test is expected to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
"By March 2020, a review of records concluded that ""breast radiography is of little value for diagnosing disease in the early stages of disease, while CT findings may be available even before symptoms appear""".
Common features of CT include bilateral polyhedral matte glass cortices with a lateral, asymmetrical, and posterior (posterior) distribution.
Subpleural dominance occurs with the progression of disease, infestation, and crazy paving patterns.
A study in Wuhan, the start of the psychiatric pandemic, compared PCR and CT and declared CT to be significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specialized and many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonia and respiratory problems.
"Until March 2020, the American Academy of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as the first line of screening for COVID-19". "Until March 2020, the CDC recommended that PCR be used for screening".
Part of the immune system response is the production of antibodies such as IgM and IgG.
These can be used to identify disease in individuals, within 7 days or more of the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population surveillance.
High-powered automated systems in many laboratories will be able to perform these assessments, but their availability depends on the production ratio for each system.
For CLT, a single blood sample is usually used, although a sample of a cannula can be used to monitor the immune system response.
For PoCT, blood sampling is usually obtained by perforating the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-test exclusion procedures are not required.On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced 29 companies that had notified the agency of the requirements and could distribute their own antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits; these kits can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the usual PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable up to 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK announced that none of the antibody test kits purchased were good enough.
"Hong Kong has set up a programme where suspected cases can stay at home, ""the emergency department gives a sample tube to the patient"", the patient throws the sample into the tube, sends it back and receives the test result after a period of time.The NHS in the UK announced that it is testing a scheme where suspected cases are tested at home to eliminate the risk of transmission on the way to hospital or the need to disinfect the ambulance carrying the patient.In COVID-19 mobility testing centres for suspected cases, a healthcare professional will take samples using appropriate precautions".
Drive-through centers helped South Korea implement one of the fastest and most comprehensive testing programs in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Forensic Health Insurers announced on March 2 that it had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in ambulances, up from 10,700 tests the week before.
When a doctor prescribes a test, the health insurance covers the costs.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 160,000 tests per week.
Testing services were offered on horseback in several major cities until March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was also uncertain, as only positive results were reported.
"The first laboratory study showed that by the calendar week of 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested, including the week of 12/2020, and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were positive for 33,491 people (6.9%).In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method to test samples taken from 64 patients simultaneously, where all samples were combined and tested individually in case of positive results.A 2,000-square-meter emergency diagnostic laboratory in Wuhan called ""Hu-Yuan"" (Chinese: 火眼, meaning "Fire-eyed") was reopened by BGI on February 5, 2020, with a daily capacity of testing up to 100,000 samples".
BGI founder Wang Jian personally oversaw the 5-day project; modeling showed that if this capacity had not been added, cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled.
After the Wuhan lab, Hu-Yan labs were quickly launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily output was 50,000 tests.Open source and composite designs developed by Origami Assays have been released, allowing up to 1,122 samples to be tested for COVID-19, using only 93 tests.These balanced designs can be implemented in small labs without the need for fluid-based robotic tools.
As of March, shortages and insufficient numbers of detectors were one of the biggest barriers to mass production of tests in the EU, UK and US.
This led some researchers to investigate sample preparation protocols that include heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE had tested more people for the coronavirus than any other country in its population at the time, and was on track to reach its overall testing level.
"This was done by combining the ability to provide riding services and the purchase of a population-scale mass sampling laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the ""Hu-Yan"" Emergency Identification Laboratories in China)".
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its scale to be operational outside China.
Various testing procedures that target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to produce kits to send to low-income countries that do not have sufficient resources to manufacture kits.
The German guideline was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol of the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying testing available in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts for testing.
On the other hand, experts say widespread access to testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
Testing capacity, mainly in the form of private sector laboratories, was built up over a period of several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization announced that testing programs should be accelerated as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus had led to hundreds of thousands of tests being stacked in private laboratories in the US and the supply of sampling kits and chemicals becoming difficult.
In March 2020, China reported that its manufactured test kits were faulty and inaccurate.
In the United States, test kits made by the CDC were "defective"; the government then removed the administrative barriers that prevented private testing.Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company called Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found the results were incorrect.
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of not receiving the correct sample or incorrect use of the test kit.
The Spanish Ministry of Defence announced that it would collect kits containing incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China had incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they be dumped into the Danube. Agca Kara, a member of the Turkish Health Ministry, said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and were "not used".
Testing, along with quarantine of people who tested positive and tracing of people who had contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2, led to positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo', where the first COVID-19 death in Italy was recorded, conducted two phases of testing on all 3,400 residents of the city, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With urban travel restricted, new infections have been completely eliminated.
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 spread in Singapore much more slowly than in other developed countries due to strict contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but no severe restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail centers were imposed.
Many events were canceled and Singapore advised its citizens to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March after a break.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with strict contact tracing programs, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent curfews.
A statistical study found that countries that performed more diagnostic tests than deaths had significantly lower mortality rates, probably because these countries were better able to identify secondary cases that had only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for approval.
Out of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Asia, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
" In the table below, the column ""Positive as % of tests"" is affected by the testing policy of each country. "
In a completely equal situation, a country that tests only hospitalized people has more positive cases per percent than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of symptoms.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also called hand hygiene, is a procedure that a person does to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances on their hands.
" Washing hands with soap continuously during ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and plague, which are transmitted via the gastrointestinal tract. "
Also, people can become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or whooping cough if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
There are five important times of day to wash hands with soap to reduce FMD transmission: after going to the toilet (sneezing and coughing), after wiping the baby's diaper (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or when handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, you can rinse your hands with ash.
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a patient.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
After emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feeding them, and touching their excrement.
Hands-on medical hygiene refers to health activities related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before using medication or treatment measures can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or illness.
This is especially important for people who work with food or in the medical field, but it is also an important exercise for the general public.
Handwashing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diseases that lead to diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
and reduced infant mortality rates in home births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing practices may lead to minor improvements in the average growth of children younger than five years.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced with simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate in these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive method of preventing diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARI), which is routinely done in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, killing 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and amyloidosis are the cause of death for approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing a sustainable habit before eating and after going to the toilet could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhea deaths by nearly half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually complemented by other disinfectant interventions with water, disinfectant and individual health programs (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents jaundice (impetigo), which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to premature injury due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching and peeling of the skin, known as eczema or dermatitis, a condition that is especially prevalent among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times of day to wash hands with soap to reduce FMD transmission: after going to the toilet (sneezing and coughing), after wiping the baby's diaper (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or when handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when handwashing techniques should be followed to prevent transmission include before and after treating a wound or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of people wash their hands with soap.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest handwashing rate at 97%, the United States was close to the average at 77% and China had the lowest rate at 23%.Several behavioral change methods for handwashing with soap are already in place.
"The ""Critical Health Care Program"" was launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines and is an example of measures to improve health and education levels and child rearing".
Twice a year, using a cream, along with daily hand washing, daily brushing with fluoride, are the highlights of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is increased by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to dissolution in water, so as to increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin, as fats and proteins, which are the building blocks of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
However, cleaning with running water is helpful...
Solid soap may contain fewer bacteria than previous uses due to its reusability.
A few studies that thought bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soaps was possible have concluded that such transmission is unlikely, as bacteria are washed with soap.
"The CDC also states: ""Liquid soap is preferable with no need for hand contact"".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted to promote public health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can produce antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not eliminated by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as previously advertised on the market.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, this advanced formula may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, and lactic acid) as pH regulators, active benzoic acid with antimicrobial properties, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that simple soaps are as effective as first-rate antibacterial soaps containing triclosan, in preventing disease and killing hand germs.
Hot water, which is convenient for hand washing, is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at eliminating natural moisture that contains soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the number of hand viruses.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a non-water-based agent for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became less popular.
They are often based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a thickener such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) that is converted into gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam to facilitate alcohol use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of liquid hydrogen peroxide increases its antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers, including at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol, are highly effective at killing germs.
Alcoholic disinfectants kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the causative agent of tuberculosis, and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol disinfectants can kill up to 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands in less than 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of 4-5) of bacteria on the hands in 1 minute.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against neuroviruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol-based massager should be applied to the skin, fully moistened and covering both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the tips of each finger are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds to dry the liquid, floor or skin.
Fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing the palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing, especially when hands are obviously dirty, over hand sanitizers.
The increased use of these detergents is based on ease of use and quick action in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol disinfectants causes dry hands, unless moisturizers and/or emollients are added to their formula.
The desiccant effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other moisturizers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing moisturizers caused less burning and dryness compared to soaps containing antibacterial agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact itch syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol-based hand gels are rare.
It is popular because it is less likely to cause itchy contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their high performance, non-aqueous base agents do not remove organic matter from hands, but disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent pathogens from spreading, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation, and historically has been much less effective than alcohol and alcohol gels.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown continuous and increasing antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which, after repeated use, likely causes reduced efficacy due to the progressive reverse reactions of the urine.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use dirt and ashes.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water, but probably less effective than soap.
Another concern is contamination of soil or ashes with microorganisms, which may contribute more to the spread of the disease than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is an antiseptic, as it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends soap, ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because stagnant pools may be contaminated, although water temperature may not appear to be different.
Rub your hands, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails, with plenty of soap.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only plain water.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Massaging the hands creates friction that helps to kill germs, while massaging for longer will kill more germs.
Take a deep dip under the waterfall.
Washing in a single sink can re-infect the hand.
Dry the broth with clean water or let it dry in the air.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to become re-infected. Areas that are not washed often include the thumb, wrist, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Fingerprints and exfoliated nail polishes may be infected with microorganisms.
Moisturizing creams are often recommended to prevent drying of the hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
"Various low-cost options can be used in developing countries to facilitate handwashing where tap water and/or soap are not available, if needed. For example, pouring water and/or soap from a hanging gallon or dry shell with appropriate holes and/or using ash. In limited irrigation conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions such as ""hand-free tap water"" and other low-consumption options are available".
Handless tap is a simple technology that uses a cloth suspended by a rope and a lever acting with a foot to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a soap mold.
Proper hand drying is an important part of hygiene, but the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets is controversial.
A growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much healthier than electric dryers used in most toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London and funded by the European Textile Paper Towel Industry Symposium to compare the health levels provided by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and Airjet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the average total number of bacteria on the palms of the hands increased by 194% and 254% respectively.
Drying hands with air conditioning increased the average number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total bacteria on the palms of the hands decreased by an average of 76% and on the palms of the hands by 77%. The scientists also conducted experiments to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-infection between other toilet users and the toilet environment due to the use of any type of drying method.
Airjet air dryers, which expel air from the car at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h), are capable of breathing microorganisms out of the hands and equipment, potentially infecting toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters above the dryer.
Paper towels showed no evidence of spreading microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different types of hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfecting towels when traveling can be a substitute for soap and water.
Alcoholic disinfectants must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory much later than when Hungarian physician Ignaz Smolovich (1846) discovered its effectiveness in preventing infection in a hospital setting.
There are a number of electronic devices that use feedback to remind people to wash their hands.
One study showed a decrease in infection rates with their use.
Medical hand washing, using adequate amounts of soap and water or a softener, and rubbing each area of the hands for at least 15 seconds.
Hands should be rubbed together with the fingers locked.
If there is a lump or tissue under the nails, it is best to use a hairbrush to clean it.
Since germs remain in the water and on the hands, it is important to water properly and then dry your hands with a clean cloth.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the tap (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents reinfection of the hands through such surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in healthcare facilities is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent the spread of the virus".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the shortage of hand washing is unacceptable in most healthcare settings, and that many doctors and nurses are constantly forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, causing the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple tasks can reduce the rate of blood-catheter infections by up to 66%.The World Health Organization has published an article to show how to use standard hand washing and proper disinfection in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Health Organization can be found on the organization's website, which is publicly available.
A related review study was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if they need to prove compliance.
"The World Health Organization introduces ""five situations"" for hand washing:""
After contact with blood/body fluids
disinfecting before applying, and
" After patient care. Adding chemical disinfectants to soap ("medical"" or ""antibacterial"" soaps) helps the disinfecting properties of hand sanitizers. "
"Such lethal measures are likely to be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To ""clean"" a person's hands for surgery, a tap of water that is not necessary to touch with hands, can be opened and closed, a chlorhexidine or iodine detergent, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush for layering and another sterile means to clean under the nails are needed".
All jewelry must be put away.
This procedure involves washing hands and elbows for two to six minutes.
Massaging is not necessary for very long periods (ten minutes).
And when he washeth his hands, the water that he hath poured upon the head shall not come into his hands.
After washing hands, dry them with a sterile hand sanitizer and wear a handkerchief.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use disinfectant before and after handling a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, the main benefit of hand washing has been shown to be only 20% of the initial washing time, with a slight additional benefit of continuing to wash beyond 35%.
Washing with simple soap leads to a three-fold increase in the transmission of bacterial infections compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison of hand-washing with alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds showed that hand-washing with alcohol reduced bacterial infections by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand sanitizers in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities can include training staff on hand washing, increasing access to alcohol hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an affordable and essential means of achieving optimal health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of safe water, soap or handwashing supplies in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing habits a challenge.
For example, in rural Africa, there are few toilets near private or public toilets, although there are inexpensive options for building handwashing facilities.
However, low handwashing rates can be partly the result of established habits rather than the lack of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term change in behavior in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential for effective functioning.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the ""three-star approach"" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost steps, such as ensuring that students wash their hands with soap in addition to adhering to other hygiene requirements".
After achieving the minimum standards, schools can be upgraded from one star to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the promotional activities of the handwashing campaign aimed at reducing childhood morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to change behavior. In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
A small number of studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness impact of handwashing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap is far more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people with vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first introduced in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Iniaz Smályi, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was ""the founder of modern nursing"" in England".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by bad smells, which they called myasthenia gravis.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important method of preventing the onset of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing to prevent such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with the content ""proper handwashing techniques"" were installed next to toilet sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and German airports".
"The phrase ""washing one's hands of"" something means declaring one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or participate in it".
It originates from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate refuses to decide to crucify Jesus Christ, but has found wider use in some English conversations.
"In Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", Lady Macbeth is repeatedly shaken unconsciously to remove the stain that represents her conscience for the crimes she committed and for which she induced her husband to commit".
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more frequently after being reminded or thinking about immoral activities and are more concerned about handwashing.
"In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such care are less likely to participate in other compensatory ""cleaning"" measures, such as volunteering".
Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual hand washing practiced in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Tu'ila and Nitla in Judaism, Lawab in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. Religions recommend sanitary hand washing, especially after certain practices.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all require that people wash their hands before and after eating.
Control of workplace risks for COVID-19
Occupational risk control for COVID-19 means the use of occupational health and safety practices to control risks and prevent the onset of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of risks in the workplace depends on the work environment and the task at hand and varies according to the risk assessment of sources of contact, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for any worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have a minimum of workplace contact with the general public and other colleagues, and it is recommended that these occupations take the minimum necessary measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if sick, wearing masks, and regular sanitation and disinfection of the workplace.
Occupations with moderate risk include those that do not require high or close contact with suspected or infected COVID-19 individuals, but may be at risk due to direct contact with the public or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public in spaces such as schools, high-density office areas and some large retail stores.
Risk control for this group, in addition to the initial prevention measures, includes air conditioning with high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protection and access to personal protective equipment for contact with a COVID-19 infected person.
OSHA considers healthcare workers who are exposed to suspected COVID-19 individuals to be high-risk occupations, which can be elevated to a high-risk level if aerosol-producing procedures are used or samples taken from suspected or infected COVID-19 individuals are collected and handled.
Among the occupational hazard controls that are appropriate for these workers are engineering controls such as negative pressure air conditioning rooms and work-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have multiple effects on the workplace.
Employees may not be at work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of exposure to illness.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the goods that are demanded and in terms of how these goods are received (such as shopping during off-peak hours or through on-site delivery or ride-hailing services).
Finally, shipping goods from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 can be problematic. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide safety measures.
The plans take into account the level of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of contact with the disease, risk factors in the social and home environment, and risk factors for each worker individually, including illness or exposure to a chronic disease.
The plan also identifies appropriate control practices necessary to prevent these risks and alternative plans for situations that may result in an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be implemented taking into account national or local recommendations.
The objectives for responding to outbreaks include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at higher risk of comorbidity, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where businesses are located, affects the responses received.
A risk control hierarchy is a framework widely used for maintaining workplace health and safety to group risk controls based on the degree of impact.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, engineering controls and then administrative controls and ultimately personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Engineering controls are designed to insulate employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes made to work policies or procedures that employees or employees must follow.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than administrative and engineering controls but can prevent some risks.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk they pose to workers, properly installed (e.g. medical masks), used continuously and regularly, properly inspected, serviced, replaced, and, if necessary, opened, cleaned and reinstalled or disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with the lowest levels of workplace contact with the public or other colleagues are those with the lowest risk.
Precautions for disease prevention recommended to people in all workplaces include regular and supplemental hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home in case of illness, wearing respiratory masks and, of course, covering their mouths when coughing or sneezing, access to paper towels and trash cans, preparing for remote communication or irregular working hours if necessary, encouraging employees to use other tools and equipment, and maintaining a regular schedule for cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected people is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, clients and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory illness symptoms stay at home for at least 24 hours after stopping the use of anti-fever medications or anti-symptomatic agents until the fever, fever symptoms, or other symptoms have resolved, and the policy on medical leave is more flexible to allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members and to inform all employees of the new guidelines.
According to OSHA's announcement, moderate-risk occupations include those that require frequent contact and relatively close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of others, and it is not clear whether clients are infected with COVID-19, but they may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community travel or international travel to a COVID-19 outbreak site.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as those in busy schools, busy workplaces, and some retail supermarkets.Engineering controls for these groups and those at higher risk include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneezing drop protectors, and installing ride-hailing service collars for customer service.Procedural controls for these groups and those at higher risk include equipment: encouraging employees to stay home if sick, encouraging employees to switch to virtual contact sessions, creating variable work hours, cancelling non-essential travel during COVID-19 outbreaks, setting up communication plans for people to communicate with, providing training and advice to customers, providing appropriate workplace safety measures, providing appropriate face masks, providing appropriate warning signs and/or other personal protective equipment, and providing regular contact information, including contact information, training and instructions for people to walk around, providing appropriate workplace safety signs and/or other protective measures, providing appropriate personal protective equipment, and providing appropriate protective measures to protect employees from COVID-19 exposure, providing appropriate and appropriate restraints, and/or other measures that are appropriate to protect employees from exposure to the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely need ventilators.
If a person becomes ill on a flight, appropriate control procedures can be used to protect staff and other passengers, including isolating the sick person from others and establishing a minimum distance of 6 feet, assigning a dedicated crew to the sick person, providing a face mask to the sick person, and requiring them to cover their mouth and nose with a towel when sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body excretions or surfaces that are likely to be contaminated, and use other personal protective equipment if possible if the sick passenger has fever, frequent coughs or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in hospital waste bags, and infected surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected after work. For commercial shipments, including those carried by cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk control includes postponing travel in case of illness, self-isolation, and promptly notifying the ship's medical center if fever or other symptoms are observed while on board.
Ideally, treatment should be followed up in the isolation cabin.The CDC recommends that schools and child care centers, regardless of the community-wide spread of the disease, be closed for a short period of time for cleaning and disinfection, as an infected person may have been present in the school building.
When the rate of social transmission is low or moderate, social distancing strategies can be used, such as cancelling camps, gatherings and other gatherings such as face-to-face learning or singing classes or eating out in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, changing start and end times, limiting the presence of non-essential clients, and using a separate health office for children with influenza-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, long-term school closures should be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.The CDC believes there are few direct health risks for law enforcement personnel who perform daytime activities.
Law enforcement officers who must contact people who are infected or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow similar procedures to emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the period of illness, employees should use a spray or household towel to clean and disinfect their belts and equipment before re-use and follow workplace standards for storing and disposing of used PPE and for washing and cleaning dirty clothes.
OSHA believes that some healthcare and refrigeration workers are in high-risk or high-risk occupations.
High-risk occupations include healthcare providers, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to infected or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If employees use aerosol-generating procedures, or collect and transport samples from suspected or infected COVID-19 patients, these cases are at very high risk of transmission.
Aerosol-generating procedures include tubing, cough reduction measures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and surgeries, or invasive sampling.
High-risk cold room jobs include those where a person must prepare the bodies of people who are suspected or infected with COVID-19 after their death; if an autopsy is performed on a corpse, these tasks are classified as high-risk jobs.Additional engineering controls should also be considered for these risk groups, including isolation rooms for patients who are suspected or infected with COVID-19, especially when aerosol-generating procedures are being performed.
In some sanitary and refrigerated environments, special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Samples should be transported with Biological Defense Level 3 precautions in mind.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be placed in isolated waiting areas, regardless of whether they are suspected of COVID-19. OSHA recommends that those who work within 6 feet of patients or people suspected of SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures wear medical masks in addition to other personal protective equipment.
In the United States, a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes face-to-face testing, exercise, and medical examination requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better samples.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve worker comfort.The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of supplemental covers, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not mainly transmitted through body excretions.
The World Health Organization recommends screening only surgical masks for personnel as a starting point.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who collect, store, or transfer respiratory samples collected from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures use surgical masks, goggles, face shields, masks, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is used, a surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends minimizing the need for personal protective equipment through the following measures: telemedicine (remotely provided medical care), physical barriers such as transparent blinds, allowing access to the COVID-19 patient room only to those who share direct care, using PPE only for essential tasks, using and not wearing a medical mask when caring for multiple patients with the same illness, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and ultimately encouraging asymptomatic people to use a regular mask.

Title: [Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of posting: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: Which rights are not reserved
We find ourselves in an interesting situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that defines the global interconnectedness of humans and our responsibilities to one another.
This is an unprecedented challenge, but we know for sure that our best response is to rely on the sense of solidarity, cooperation and social responsibility that lies at the heart of this organization.
The empathy and care we saw through emails, phone calls and chat among all our colleagues shows how lucky we are to be working with such extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud to have such brothers and sisters as you.
Last week, someone shared their gratitude for our work with me.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to go to Wikipedia now and how staying online and accessible to all is a powerful symbol for this critical resource.
Your efforts make this possible, whether it's helping keep the sites running or getting colleagues paid or keeping our community safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
Now is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, several significant changes will be made in the way we work together from next week.
Our work shifts and schedule
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C members met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered issues that we thought were the best response to the problem we face and the best way to maintain effective and sustainable company efficiency.
We want above all to relieve tension and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Until further notice, our daily work forecast will be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week.
We will not declare a lockdown - if you are able to work longer hours than normal, the mission can benefit from your help.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to provide care and food for your loved ones or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not record your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It is not necessary to mention this, but we will mention it again.
Which medical leave or PTO is not required - just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and time allocations to ensure that important work areas are covered.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please notify Brian at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can help you with support and ensure management is adequately taking care of your situation.)
The salary of people who work by the hour will be supplemented.
We have stated before and we commit again to respect our obligations to our contractors and watch colleagues.
Everyone should be paid according to normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly valuable, especially in times like this one.
We remind you again that this is about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and can adjust ourselves accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are things we still need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process across all units to assess current objectives and focus on supporting whatever is necessary to accomplish this mission.
There is a lot of work to do, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down the current work rate will not cause further damage.
"We do not intend to ""double down"" on time to make up for the backlog when this pandemic is over".
You will not be expected to work harder to meet deadlines, which are now unreasonable.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will take action if necessary to set new goals and timelines.
What happens to the APP (annual planning)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of the workday, we intend to change the time frame for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We plan to expand our 2019-2020 schedule to allow for more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize essential tasks, taking care of themselves and their loved ones, while those who need or want to work have a lighter work schedule in the coming weeks.
This extension of the schedule reduces the current workload for planning and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps once we receive approval.
We thank the APP team for their leadership.
Situation, level of risk and cleanliness of the workplace
Last week, we learned that one of our staff at SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired a team of anti-virus cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces as well as the lobby and the loft rooms that lead to the basement floor.
The building implements its own protocol of care by using products that protect the immunity of its occupants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully ready for our return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC employees.
Last week, our DC office became fully remote and in line with the shared guidance with San Francisco.
As some colleagues in New York City know, we are in negotiations to rent a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are experiencing remote working for the first time.
Our long-term remote workers should be aware that changes may occur, and I felt I had to make a few recommendations:
The duration of the sessions should be limited to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider splitting the meeting and holding it in a few days.
Define the meeting clearly, have a meeting schedule and send in advance the material to be read.
Make video calling a default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live communication.
In all meetings, have a leader, someone who oversees the conversation on questions and follows the list of people who speak, and someone to take notes (or collaborate on taking notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Use your welfare refund to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack and talk to your colleagues about workflow
The HR operations team is reviewing ergonomics-oriented guidance and webinars to support increased work distribution across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of social assistance to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Edit Eaton, until the end of the pandemic is declared by the World Health Organization.
We inform them that we understand that your request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities and no one will be penalized for delaying or changing those objectives.
In the coming week, we will provide more tips on Wikimania and other local and thematic community conferences.
It appears that the world is somewhat upset about the shutdown, but they feel relieved that they can focus on their social activities, Wikimedia and other methods with transparency.
CRT is taking a step forward, working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and track our interactions with them.
Stay informed about COVID-19 issues
We will send out an invitation to a special staff meeting for Thursday at 14:00 UTC.
We will use this opportunity to share additional weather reports, answer your questions and keep in touch.
We are stuck in this situation together and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to access information via this email and visit the Office Wiki for all other essential information related to COVID-19.
CRT helps to update these pages and keep all the information together.
We are also making every effort to regularly communicate with workers in the countries most affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or coverage challenges, or any other issue that you need help with, please report to and cooperate with the CRT immediately.
We are available to help provide support and communicate, as needed.
If you are aware of a sensitive or confidential matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of Global Operations International HR.
Any of these changes should not be considered as a departure from work or obligations.
On the contrary, they already suggest that our work and commitments must be adapted in new ways that have not been experienced before.
These are steps we believe are essential to support each other in order to continue working, to inject the support the movement needs and to support the world it depends on.
Our planned work is waiting for us at the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for the important work we will have in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to do this, and so we want all of you to take care of yourselves and your family so that you are in the best possible position when needed.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other management team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2B (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung, blood vessel, heart, liver and spleen cells.
ACE2 counters the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by reducing the amount of angiotensin-2 and increasing the amount of angiotensin-1-7, making it an effective drug target for treating cardiovascular disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme contains a zinc-containing metaloenzym located on the surface of cells in the vein and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal M2 peptidease domain and the C-terminal polymerase chain amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein with an enzyme-activated domain that is localized on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane-bound domain by another enzyme called shadase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane of primarily porous lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, intravascular cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE antibody.
The hormone ACE divides angiotensin one into angiotensin two, which is a vascular blocker.
ACE2 instead isolates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin two (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin dilatant (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can cause the breakdown of a number of other peptides including /des-arg9-brededicin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the passage of neutral amino acid carriers SLC6A19 through the membrane and is also involved in heart failure.
ACE2 acts as a membrane-bound protein, acting as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the spike protein S1 in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 binds to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface, leading to endocytosis and the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes in the cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of protein S by host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is being investigated as a potential treatment.This led to the hypothesis that decreased ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several oral societies and surveillance organizations have recommended continuation of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A baseline review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 percent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls""".
"In addition, ""the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients who were at higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in deaths from lung disease, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of lung disease".
Human neutrophil ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute lipopolysaccharide-induced respiratory dysteresis syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus a 24-hour effect period.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are resistant to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with long-term angiotensin II. Injection of rhACE2 has been studied in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory dysteresis syndrome.
"Covid-19 B apps are mobile phone software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
Many applications were introduced or developed with official government support in some regions and territories.
Several frameworks have been developed to create contact tracing applications.
There have been concerns about privacy, especially about systems that work based on tracking the geographic location of mobile app users.
Options with less interference include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be rolling out the ability to support these Bluetooth-based apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a software called Tris Togder is used.
"The app was developed by the local IT association, published as open text and delivered to the government.North Macedonia launched a mobile app called ""StopKorona!"", based on Bluetooth to track contact with potentially infected people, allowing health authorities to respond quickly".
The software was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing program was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar programs are planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid"")."
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing software based on Singapore's WeTrustTogether software and the Bluetooth protocol.Russia plans to design its geofence software for COVID-19 positive patients living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems in application-based systems, including false positives and inefficiencies if the application is used only for a small fraction of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, restricting this to only ""official"" or authorized organizations".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the use of mass surveillance with coronavirus applications, especially in connection with the dismantling of surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic after the virus threat was eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
The organizations announced 8 conditions for government projects:
"Surveillance must be ""legal, necessary, and proportionate"";"
The expansion of surveillance and surveillance must have deadlines;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be maintained and this protection must be demonstrated on the basis of evidence.
Digital surveillance should not be used to increase discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be safeguards against abuse and civil rights to respond to abuse;
"Significant participation will be required by all ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published a checklist".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to eliminate the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their device's operating system when it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was confirmed.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data. A number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for two-way communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform call tracing.
Instead of using an assignment program, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combines these to generate alerts via text messages to people suspected of infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential audiences, the government has made location information publicly available, which was allowed due to extensive changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of apps and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered using centralized systems and privacy-preserving measures.
As of 6 April 2020, details had not yet been released.
Privacy-friendly contact tracing is a well-established idea that has been the subject of countless research since at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include adjacent privacy tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), TCN count of temporary calls, FKA, CEN count of call events, privacy sensitive protocols, and mobile phone call tracking (PACT) mechanisms, among others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the machine and all tracking takes place in the machine.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using situational or cross-traffic data to track COVID-19 transmission.
"It is based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Privacy in a Time of Epidemic"" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that were originally developed at the MIT Media Lab as well".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was formed by groups that were built around essentially the same approach and broadly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing multiplicity and building global collaboration in tracking and alerting programs - a key aspect to achieving broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used in official government software open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an innovation for contact tracking based on a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption, which they claim is privacy-saving.
They have also published specifications for the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be deployed in three phases:
Launch of new tools to empower governments to create official coronavirus tracking programs while maintaining privacy.
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to distribute the system first through system alerts and then remove it in the same way after the risk is passed.
Drug b reuse (also known as drug-conversion, re-profiling, re-use, or therapeutic conversion) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a different medical condition or condition than the one for which the drug was originally developed.
This is a front of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include developing a COVID-19 vaccine and injecting plasma from recovered individuals.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 proteins that are susceptible to drug development, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites will lead to a reasonable project to produce an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S-proteins and ADP ribophosphatases.
Hussain A.A. and colleagues studied several sample compounds and optimized and analyzed them for their structural similarity to similar drugs with the highest approval rates in order to accelerate the development of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study, which is recommended in a clinical study design.

"A study of lupinavir/ritonavir (KALTRA), a combination of lupinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
These drugs are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is working to modify the drug and find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community about the direction of resources towards the use of psychiatric drugs, especially those produced for AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lupinavir/ritonavir in a joint international trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in indoor conditions against multiple phyllo-, nemo-, paramexo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to disease and more severe transmission.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical studies are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with mild disease and one for patients with severe disease.
Three clinical trials for vitamin C injection in hospitalized and critically ill individuals with COVID-19 are underway; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).

The study, called COLCORONA, will benefit 6,000 adults 40 years and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but experience mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not use an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anti-convulsants have been tested in Italy.
Heparin is widely used to treat patients due to its low molecular weight, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines for its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of sodium anoxafarin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been devoted to converting approved antiviral medications that have been approved for previous outbreaks of viruses such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the seventh edition of the Chinese guidelines.

Further trials were conducted in Italy and China, and you can see tucislizumab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical studies, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were in Phase I immunity studies in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using released genomes to develop potential vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2.
As stated in April, CEPI's guidelines for vaccine development include: speed, production capacity, scale-up and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform, which has progressed in the first phase of immunization studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase one enhancer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer phase one and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 carrier)
According to scientists at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in April, a total of 115 vaccines are in the early stages of development, with 78 approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 vaccines announced but little information available to the public (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II trials test for early immunity and development of immunity and are generally randomized and placebo-controlled and performed in multiple sites, while determining a more effective and accurate dose.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, as well as monitoring for side effects at the optimal dose.
"Of the 79 proposed vaccines currently in active development (approved in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in the human trial phase (still in ""preclinical"" trials)".
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating a possible molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune system response.

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities partnered to provide resources for access to IBM's cloud computing, along with cloud computing resources from Hult Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have had non-homogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they can have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible that vaccines under development are not safe or effective.
Preliminary research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using specific animal models of COVID-19, including transgenic ACE2-based mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman mammals, indicates the need for Level-3 biosafety measures to control live viruses as well as international coordination to ensure standard immunity procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to articles published in 2005 or 2006, introducing and developing vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became public, it was believed that existing research on SARS could provide a useful model for developing a vaccine and treatment for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical studies and three others are underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S) case.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that claims the COVID-19 virus is known and a vaccine is already available.
Patents referenced by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of the coronavirus, such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some people develop viral sinusitis and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people recovered.The virus was initially transmitted by direct contact, usually through drops of fluid from coughing, sneezing or talking.
When these droplets are produced during the sapphire, they usually stick to the ground or surfaces rather than being moved over long distances.
People can become infected by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The disease is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although there may be spread before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reverse transcriptase-reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the subarachnoid tube.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for public use of masks vary, with some authorities opposing, some recommending, and some making it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue or shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, pain or constant pressure on the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluing of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Sometimes, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some patients in China had only chest stiffness and wheezing.
In some people, the disease may lead to chest and arm pain, multiple limb paralysis and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but the stage of evolution may vary between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people show symptoms up to 11.5 days after infection.Reports suggest that not all cases of infection necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors in transmission of the virus is not fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests they may play a role in the spread of the virus.
The proportion of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and under study, with 20% of all confirmed cases remaining asymptomatic during hospital admission, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily case count on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva contain a high amount of pathogenicity.
Talking out loud emits more microphones than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a cough without protection can cause respiratory droplets to be ejected from a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences said transmission is also possible and that samples from people's outdoor air have also shown positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be dispersed into the air, resulting in airborne emissions.
Although there are concerns that the disease may also be transmitted by the intake of drugs, it is very unlikely.The most contagious form of the disease is when a person has symptoms, although transmission before symptoms appear is possible but very unlikely.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while the ease of transmission of the disease is not entirely clear, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been shown to be 99% detectable for up to one day on cardboard, more than three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also useful if used correctly: soap products eliminate and inactivate the virus's protective mucus layer, as well as isolate the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxydine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken at intervals of two days after admission.
In 5 of the 6 patients, the first sample had the highest viral load and the 6th patient had the highest viral load on the second day.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first identified in three people with chest and abdomen disease in Wuhan who had low blood oxygen levels and respiratory problems.
All of the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed with ordinary soap, partly by its retaining bubble being removed from the produced soil.
The lungs are the most susceptible to COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor that has the highest number of alveolar cells of the two lungs.
"The virus uses a specific glycoprotein (peplomer) called a ""spike"" to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell".
In 12% of hospitalizations in Wuhan, China, acute heart failure was found, which is more common in severe cases.
The rate of cardiovascular disease is high due to inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but damage to the heart muscle may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and share the purpose of heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 show extensive alveolar destruction (DAD) and inflammatory lesions involving lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 tends to target mucous cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 show symptoms of hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was shown that GM-CM-secreting pathogenic T cells are associated with the activation of IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology among COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic artery disease was also reported in the autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the instant reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a swab from a nasal swab may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of low momentary value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence, so laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect virus-based infection.
As of 4 April 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) was under development, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experimentation has shown that the accuracy of the test is only 60 to 70 percent.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first point-of-care test in the United States on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.Diagnostic procedures published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical features and infectious diseases.
Bipolar matte vitreous colitis with an ambient, asymmetrical and backward distribution is common in early infection.
Pulmonary congestion, abnormal structures (thickening of the lobe blades and variable congestion of the air sacs) and pulmonary density are signs of disease progression.
Little information is available on the microscopic and pathophysiological effects of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from the autopsy include:
Macroscopy: purity, cardiac exocytosis, pulmonary stabilization and pulmonary embolism
Four types of severe viral pneumonia are observed:
Mild chest and hip: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic artery and large-cell formation
Severe pneumonia: widespread alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and decreased blood oxygen levels.
Treatment of chest and armpit: alignment of secretions in the air sacs and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: widespread intravascular coagulation (DIC); locurotroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with sitting hands.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends covering your mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing, and if no towel is available, coughing or sneezing in your own mouth.
Hand hygiene is recommended after sneezing or coughing.
To limit transmission by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC has recommended the use of face coverings in public places.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact between infected people and the public by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing procedures also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19 infection. Since the shortest possible time to achieve a vaccine will not be earlier than 2021, a key issue in COVID-19 control is the effort to slow the peak of the disease, or the so-called ""clearing of the curve""".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are obviously dirty, before eating or after wiping their nose, after sneezing and coughing.
In addition, it is recommended that consumers use alcohol with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.WHO recommends two formulas for local production for areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
In this formula, the antimicrobial activity is due to ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol. "" It is not an active hand sanitizer""".
Glycerol was added as a moisture absorber.
Individuals are monitored with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, auxiliary oxygen, and support of other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being infected use a simple face mask.
Exterior membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory distress, but its benefits are still being investigated.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve the immune system.
Supportive therapies may be effective for people with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese National Health Commission (CHNHC) issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Specialist and pulmonary care specialists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals prefer to prescribe paracetamol for symptom relief rather than ibuprofen for primary treatment.
Care must be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in treatment environments where suspended particles may be produced during procedures such as piping and the use of a manual respirator.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne infection control.The CDC describes procedures for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended supplies include: PPE, respiratory systems or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has only authorized the use of these masks for approved emergency use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent for uses not listed on the label is not guaranteed.
The CDC recommends the use of face protection, or as a last resort, home masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical respiration or similar, but a percentage of cases require this.
The type of respiratory support needed by patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is currently being studied in people in hospital, and evidence has shown that intubation or tubing into the respiratory system can be prevented by using a high pressure tube or a semi-positive air pressure tube.
Whether either of these results in the same benefit for people with severe illness is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to continue with an invasive mechanical ventilator during access, as this technique limits the dispersion of aerosol particles compared to long-stream nasal cannula oxygen therapy.Acute cases are most common in people with dementia (people over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds, which limits the capacity of a health system to handle the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases that require urgent hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were transferred to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) progresses in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators, including high pressure control modes and PEEP, are used to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of lung damage associated with the respiratory system and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are being studied in clinical trials.
RedSevere has been the most effective so far.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, many of the drugs under testing have already been proven for other uses or have already been approved in advanced trials.
Antiviral medications may be tested on people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials to determine the efficacy and immunity of potential drugs.The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a temporary authorization for the use of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical studies required to demonstrate its immunity and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China introduced a mobile software to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
"The application is able to detect ""close contact"" and consequently potential risk of infection using surveillance data".
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app will not only recommend self-quarantine, but also alert local health officials of the risk.Big data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and AI will be used to track infections and people who have been in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government activated security agencies to track the phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus infection.
This measure is to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared shared location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Giulio Galera, a member of the Italian Regional Health Board, said that mobile operators had informed him that ""40% of people are going back and forth in any case""".
The German government ran a recent week-long 48-hour hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for global creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People in quarantine may experience anxiety, travel restrictions, medical side effects, or fear of infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: ""More social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and the economic crisis are all a storm in the making to damage people's mental health and wellbeing""".
The disease may have a mild or no-symptomatic course and is similar to the disease with common upper respiratory problems such as a normal fall.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while in people with severe and serious illness, recovery may take three to six weeks.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of COVID-19, but COVID-19 data are not yet available.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 may progress rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome (ARD), which can lead to respiratory distress, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include pertussis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, or specifically an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal liver function was seen in 4% of this group.
In about 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19, their liver enzymes (transaminases) are elevated.
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five days were spent in hospital.
However, the median time between admission to the ICU and death was 7 days for patients who were admitted to the ICU.
In one study of early cases, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent, compared to 1.7 percent for women.
Tissue examinations of lung samples after death showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibroxide exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic transformation was observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lung was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, the extent of heart damage was due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data in the US, 89% of people hospitalized had co-morbidities.
Estimates of mortality from these conditions vary due to regional differences as well as methodological problems.
A lower count of mild cases leads to an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by previous infections could mean that the mortality rate is now estimated to be lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and are almost 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong hospital official identified a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who had recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This may also lead to post-exercise syndrome.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether previous infection caused effective and long-lasting immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
The life-saving immunity of individuals appears to be likely due to the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported of people who have been reinfected after being infected with COVID-19.
It is believed that these cases worsen long-term infection rather than reinfection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin transmitted by infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but the spread of the infection was complementary to human-to-human transmission until December 2019.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 announced the first date of onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
Official documentation from the World Health Organization reported that the first symptoms of the disease were on December 8, 2019.
Several criteria are usually used to quantify mortality rates.
These figures vary by region and over time, and vary by frequency of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed since outbreak onset, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for patients who died without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who were clinically or epidemiologically infected with COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (15,3822/22,40191).
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates the number of people who became ill and died, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected cases (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these antibodies in a person indicates how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, in the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, 80 (1.7%) of the 4,600 inhabitants died.
In Ganglet, the virus spread through carnival festivals and spread among young people, which reduced mortality rates. However, not all COVID-19 deaths may be of this type.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not discouraged from accepting and treating patients.
In the Netherlands, from the estimates made from blood donors, about 3% of people may have antibodies.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the associated mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate in men was higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is for men in their 50s, with the gap between men and women only at 90%.
In China, the mortality rate was 8.2% among men and 7.1% among women.
The primary cause of this gender difference is not known, but behavioral and genetic factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men's incidence of chronic diseases, such as hypertension at a younger age than women, may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were also men.
As of April 2020, the US government no longer tracks data on COVID-19 transmission through sexual contact.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, AIDS, influenza and SARS have different effects on women and men.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, who are more likely to be infected with the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is ""COVID-19"" (COVID-19)".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the initials of the word coronavirus, VI is the initials of the word virus and D is the initials of the word disease in English, and the number 19 represents the year of the first case of infection: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen based on global naming guidelines to prevent stigma, with the intention not to refer to a specific geographic area (e.g., China), or a specific species of animal or population group.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
"In addition, the World Health Organization uses the term ""COVID-19 virus"" or ""COVID-19 causative virus"" in public statements".
"Covid-19 usually refers to both the virus and the disease".
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly known as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization renamed the disease 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory syndrome 2019-nCoV, following guidelines issued in 2015 for temporary localization of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard service chains, some digital factories are producing medical products such as nasal swabs or ventilator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to supply it, a local reverse engineering startup produced 100 valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
It is known that humans are capable of spreading the virus to a number of other animals.
Research to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and mice failed.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, scientific groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""coherent trial"" (SOLIDARITY Trial) to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes of effect".
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine prototypes.
Because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells, previous research on SARS-CoV is useful.
Three vaccination strategies have been studied in this context.
Initially, the researchers' goal was to develop a complementary virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, sub-vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In relation to SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on high-spike S-proteins that help the virus bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (RNA or DNA vaccines, a new technique for advancing vaccination).
The experimental vaccines of each of these strategies should be tested for immunity and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent improvement has been proposed as a potential challenge for developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical studies were ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven trials for the treatment of malaria are currently being evaluated, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
New antiviral drugs with high performance are the focus of much of the Chinese research, with nine clinical trials of the third phase of Remdesivir in various countries conducted in late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic clinical process to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the drugs nominated for this purpose was underway. Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta, are under review.
As of March 2020, there is experimental evidence of the effectiveness of RedSevere.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients undergoing treatment with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China with initial results in February 2020.
However, there are calls for research review by other researchers.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that doubling this dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to doctors to treat people with COVID-19. Chinese procedures for the seventh edition include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use in COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions.
After demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, nitasoxanide was recommended for further study in the body. Studies have shown that the primary synthesis of spike protein with intermembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
High-level studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have many limitations that prevent the medical community from accepting and testing these therapeutic practices without further study.
Cytokine storms can be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytocin storm properties.Tucelisomab was included in treatment guidelines after completing a brief study by the National Health Commission of China.
After showing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing a nationwide Phase 2 non-randomized trial in Italy.
Blood tests, in combination with serum ferritin tests, are used to diagnose cases of cytokine storm, to counteract such symptomatic developments that are said to be the cause of death in many infected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, based on previous case studies.
To date, there is no randomized or controlled evidence that tuclizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified antibodies and collected antibodies from the immune system of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to infected cases is currently being investigated as a non-vaccination method.
This strategy was tested for SARS without definitive results.
Viral neutralization is a predicted mechanism by which treatment with passive antibodies can create a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity and/or cell-dependent phagocytosis are also possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum production from healthy individuals, which includes the blood fluid from recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster utilization.
COV-related diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died after being made aware of the spread of the virus.
