The FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will hold the third Expert session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency over the course of the year, reports in a press release, which came to the edition of "Lenty.ru".
The third meeting is planned to submit the results of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants of the event are planning to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for the conduct of evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a single approach for all three academies to the methodology of assessing the performance of the activities of scientific organizations.
In the past five months we have managed to do so, and the final version of the regulatory documents is on agreement.
According to the results of the upcoming session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and deadlines of the evaluation,” said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical management of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutions.
The results are expected to be adopted by a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have discovered a way to find royal stars.
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star accumulations.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars related, i.e. emerging from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in the journal Nature, and you can briefly read them on the University’s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixture in the gas clouds, prior to the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, it can be determined by its chemical composition the place of its birth and the region of the formation of the star-born.
Earlier, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of the relatives in the cluster.
The simulation results conducted by astrophysics show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer simulated two interstellar gas flows that formed a cloud together.
This object over a few million years under the influence of its own gravity turns into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint-marking to the original gas flows and found that due to rapid turbulent mixture in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
As astrophysics believe, their research proves that it is possible to search for star-genitors by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carata police arrested 20-year-old after high-speed motorcycle persecution

Lavrov: Russia will not "clop the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “clock the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking before the students and teachers of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, imagine, because everything must be specifically calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will look like this time, we will decide how to respond to it.
This will not be associated with the clumping of the doors, some of the insults, misunderstood, the minister stressed.
We, first of all, will withdraw from our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business and make conclusions from the actions of our partners on the subject of their adequacy, contractuality and reliability.
According to the steps that are taken in the area of sanctions, you can very well judge what the partners are achieving, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If they say in full voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do so to punish Russia,” it is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions is not.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU’s discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time applies anti-dumping measures against the sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to activate the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU’s third energy package standards retrospectively,” Lavrov said.
How to use cheese in garden design?
The question is answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since cheese after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other crops.
It is perfectly combined with many cultures.
And next to the cheese you can and need to plant both plants, decorative in other times, and flowing simultaneously with it.
Another plus sirene is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stumbling tree of different heights, improved cave, a cave with a wide foundation and even a resemblance of a garden bonsai - a tree with a strangely curved stumbling.
Just choose the shape that more fits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted of selling false money
According to the Republican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olanetsk and Seige districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Volodsk region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared in front of the Oloan District Court.
And for the end of the investigation for the crimes committed in our republic, he was staged in Segeju.
The investigation has proven guilt for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, the material of the criminal case with the accusation was sentenced to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court issued a decision to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with a celebration in the colony of the general regime.
The judgment has not entered legal force.
Remember, last week two other vendors of false money, which were paid by them in the stores of Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
Citizens of Azerbaijan arrived in Karelia also from St. Petersburg.
One was imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each has a fine of 500 thousand rubles.
The judgment has not yet entered into legal force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73th anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The meeting, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Derwish delivered military assistance from the US and the UK to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial event took place near the stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the coastline name of Sedov in Solombala.
At the event were gathered representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children from the Kadet class.
We gathered for the first time twenty-three years ago when a stone was placed.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those whom the sea has not returned,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Northern Sea Veterans Council.
Then the city's spiritual orchestra performed on the event, and the educators of the Cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flag of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the exposure of flowers to the stone.
The convoy consists of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped shoes, lead, hair and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, and fifteen Harikein fighters - were on board.
The convoy was accompanied by 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The carriage of the vessels was not found by the opponent and successfully reached the destination point - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in crucial karavan operations, 126 transport and about 50 military ships were killed.

The very American ideal is that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Kit Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a draft law to protect trade unions as a civil law.
“Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is the Co-Chairman of the Progressive Party Congress.
This is why I am proud to present the Act on the Rights of Workers along with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement by John Lewis.
This innovative draft law will give workers the same legal possibilities in the discrimination of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of the opponents of trade unions.
The amendment of the Law on the regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts – and to receive compensation for damages and penalties – is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is undoubtedly not a radical initiative – at least according to U.S. standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors proposed is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks faced by trade unions in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country – the Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the Hideaki Todjo’s militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Being fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included a text that directly acknowledged that “the workers’ right to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to disrupt this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered unlawful.
When the former First Lady of Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which prepared the World Declaration on Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the composers included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, the Americans accepted the basic rule that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries about how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and to participate as a equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions – should be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As the preacher Martin Luther King Jr said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the forces of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the living level of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History reminds us as we should.
The official recognition of labor rights as human rights – and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions – has long been mature.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis resurrect the ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the US, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say it is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed for execution by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginal in June and had to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who do abortions would be obliged to have authority to take patients to the hospital in a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
“The applicants will be allowed to work legally, continuing to take action to obtain powers,” Judge John DeGravels wrote in his judgment.
The hearing will be appointed within a month in which the judge will make a more permanent judgment under this law.
The abortion rights defenders have met this decision, the latter in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give the doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that Louisiana’s women will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit for the suspension of the law by three out of five clinics in the state.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics who did not appear as prosecutors in this case, and also submitted a claim on reception powers.
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that adopted similar laws, and the courts recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion together with the American College of Abortions and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws on admission powers impose on doctors restrictions that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Abortion opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one physician who makes an abortion in Louisiana has the authority to be hospitalized, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, afraid of his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they will not punish the doctors doing abortions until their claims on admission authority are waiting for a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
Not less than half of the products in every kind of goods in the range of trading networks should be of Russian production, the deputy of the State Duma from the "Justice Russia" group Oleg Nilov said.
The parliamentary has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper "Izvestia" writes.
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
According to the remaining groups of products that are produced in Russia, retailers will have to supply at least half of their plots to domestic producers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the Foundations of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" the bill provides for the introduction of amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trading networks is part of a package of stimulating measures for Russian manufacturers.
There will be several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalogovik", a member of the independent expert center "Social Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agriculture and food industry, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
Plus there will be farmers, farmers, small stores.
They will be able to sell more, and that means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will be entitled to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some faster to gain, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, really, not immediately,” the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian companies were often unable to break into local stores due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, it is now a moment of silence, when the former players have already gone, and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rise in prices for finished products," said the first Vice-President of the All-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", K.N. Tamara Kasyanova.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to fix the sector behind local manufacturers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that by means of the subsidies of another state are cheaper.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will develop between companies working according to the unified laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasianova notes that Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of co-patrioters far from all articles.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to "take" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
This increases the concerns that goods of poor quality will come to the catch.
Per, under the type of manufactured in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be delivered," the expert added.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this breakdown, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas on domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may decrease in quality to the import analogues, while stores will be able to boost prices to the second as the defective goods.
The idea of import replacement was forgotten in the early 2000s, and economists again spoke in February this year due to the constant devaluation of the ruble.
Now, in the background of difficult relations with the West, the question of refusal to import products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is intended to oblig retailers when making orders to suppliers to consider with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import replacement, and the system of production planning on the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quotation mechanism will be effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is high, for example, in the dairy sector where the import share was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the attractions of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impuls can also get meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports isined in beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still belongs to Russian products,” Kasyanova says.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will promote import replacement and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative itself will not lead to import replacement, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is confident.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, and therefore, complete import replacement will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is little to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide," the expert states.
Immediately diagnosed and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video of memory of their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who say goodbye in rural areas in Australia are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer than those who live in cities.
The researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
Leading researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Institute of Medical Research Berghofer that the chance of dying during the study was 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
New drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
The older women and those who had cancer in the later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the chance of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a timeless diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improved quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she assumed that increasing the number of department services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to the home, and support programs for people who are taking treatment far from their home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical location, the study found that the length of life among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nev, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the doors in the Kushner district.
The construction of a medical facility in the town of Toktaibelak was started in April of this year and was carried out by a typical project.
The cost of the work was somewhat more than 10 million rubles.
According to the Administration of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out by means of the Republican budget in accordance with the address investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is 230 square meters.
Here they will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelak and the villages of Dementiovo, Puncherumal, Tuna, Fomichi, Toraibelak, Shinur and Chashkal.
The new fields will replace the existing FAP, the building which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygiene requirements.
A new facility will be opened soon.
The murder of a four-month-old son in an unhealthy state will be presented before the court
The resident of Chuvashia will be on the scale of the accused for killing his own child.
The investigation of the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26, this year, the accused, together with a four-month son, came to celebrate the birthday of the child of her cousin in Cheboksara.
After a long stagnation, the newborn decided to stay in the guests and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up and was crying at night, the woman put it next to her on bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman fell on her son, which resulted in the death of the deceased.
Criminal case, according to the press service of the S.U.S.R.S.R. in Chuvashia, is sent to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Do Russians feel a sharp price rise?
As a result of the cross sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not be placed in the forecasts of the authorities, the analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, reports RBC Daily.
According to the latest Mineconomy forecast, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7,5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the "Kommersanth" newspaper, this week the Minister of Economic Affairs should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will allow to eliminate the expected decline in population income growth.
The forecast was that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in force one year - until August 2015.
How could we predict such high inflation?
The current situation implies a single shock, but the lower inflation trend will not change," a source told the newspaper in Minsk.
Economists from VTB Capital don’t share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic block regarding inflation and predict prices growth in 2014 at a level of 8%.
The main effect of the product prohibitions will come along with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation of sales tax (NSP) in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will take place in February, after which the annual rates of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat made the first inflation results after the Russian Federation introduced "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru surveyed experts and identified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
The price rise is already observed in the main segment of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be priced, the government was forced to launch measures of systematic price stability monitoring to prevent the risks of unjustified price rise in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulatory authorities so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates the price rise.
Key factors for the growth of the index of consumer prices continue to be the vast rates of capital flows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the escape of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food goods from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum product set would not jump by 12% in a quarter.
The ban on the import of food products caused the shock of supply on the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are unable to fully launch the mechanism of import replacement, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market by the expense of domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth of the inflation component.
If we add the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated prospects of economic growth, by the end of this year inflation can quite exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvayev, Director of the analysis department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another thing that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think, by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8,5%.
Plato Maguta, managing the assets of the UK "Maguta Fund"
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia is still successfully shut down, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in cash purchases to safeguard their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulations.
But prices rise starts traditionally after the summer silence and this autumn will become more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5%, most likely, will stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial accumulations.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decline in the number of household owners
This decline, due to the exclusive decrease in the number of household owners under the age of 35, may lead to the fact that garden centers will begin to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “basic age of gardening,” according to the HTA study, which was by Financial Times.
According to this report, people who waste housing spend an average of 55 percent of the amount the owners of their homes spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courts in front of the house for parking and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of household owners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in the UK rate of spending on goods for gardeners on households.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society that housing rental and lack of garden space do not mean that people can’t grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Culture plants in containers, for example, is popular among tenants who can carry plants with themselves when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of retail goods for gardening as a result of the increase in the number of household owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after bad conditions in March and April of last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass cleaning in the "Agriculture" fund

Turkey calls U.S. diplomat for spy message
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has called the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country for explanations in connection with the report on U.S. and British spy in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. affairs officer and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the Internet magazine "The Intercept" that the documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying each other.
The previously information that the main German intelligence agency has also made Ankara an intelligence site has caused a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's biggest companies united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete on the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
The Union of the Greatest
Companies are planning to invest in the joint venture of 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70% of it will belong to Wanda and 15% of each of the online companies, Wanda Group said in a statement.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
SP will combine the search services of Baidu with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with a number of users of about 438 million people), Tencent and the Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 fashionable hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema studio and theme entertainment park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring profits of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American cinema network AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the world’s largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dun Ce, who will head the new company, thanks to the Wanda unification will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site is expected to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers on the Internet by making them come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are kupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest “chicken” in online commerce,” Wanda’s chief executive, Van Jianglin, said.
“Now the real O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation the chances of everyone are approximately equal,” he says.
The Chinese online trading market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: it is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And according to the forecast, by 2015 this number could increase to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten until recently was the richest man in China, however, according to Bloomberg’s millionaire index, Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma has already overcome him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s status is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among the richest people in China, while Van Jianglin from Wanda is fourth in the ranking.
“After this battle it’s very interesting to observe: three of the richest people unite their efforts to challenge even more rich,” said Bloomberg’s director of the Chinese e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Cao Lee.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Roma cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only with new companies, but also with the deserved leaders of the world’s online trade, testifies the previously published report on Alibaba’s financial figures for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than its two American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit over the period is almost twice the equivalent summarized competitor figure – it has grown almost three times the annual estimate and reached $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has huge potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” Bloomberg report analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service commented.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, which significantly exceeds the March index (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions for the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is going to name the price of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The road show of the company, which preceded this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO output is expected to be a record in the NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
Until now, the record in the volume of the funds attracted on the U.S. stock exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 held the primary placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in trade networks should be of Russian production, the Deputies of the State Duma believe.
They have drafted a bill on this topic.
Amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Foundations of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
According to the draft law, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be on all kinds of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so for them will be made a "skick" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the implementation of all food goods whose country of origin is Russia.
On 27 August, the lower house of the parliament was submitted a draft law on amendments to the FZ "On Retail Markets", which proposes to rebuild the farm markets in Russia, on which small producers will be able to realize their products.
Magalouf police chief accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented the evidence of the harassment by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor's office in Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Calvia police on the resort island of Malorka was arrested as a result of accusations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalously famous centre of unbeaten drunken Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was arrested as a result of corruption accusations brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Balena, the street where the majority of the bars and night clubs are located.
According to the daily online edition Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of harassment by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption accusations and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC that dissatisfied nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot threaten our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalouf came into the headline of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British traveler who passed 24 men during a bar race.
The island’s authorities have since been trying to stop the humiliation among the Magalouf residents, minimizing the number of scandalously famous alcohol races on the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the coin incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar races together were sentenced to a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magalouf, mostly popular among young British tourists, was also the place of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic drunk associated with the mad entertainment known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
Spring prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing flood rain and strong winds that influenced flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at 9 in the evening, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short lights with a breathtaking wind, including a storm, which began shortly before 8 a.m. and flooded almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter issued the early portion of the spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
The bad conditions are supposed to be one of the reasons for the delay of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land as scheduled immediately after 7:30 p.m., but came into the wind shift zone - sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to get high.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to gain height during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed around 8:40 pm.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
The maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two leaves.
The calculation of the cost of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new manner.
The issues of pricing, the regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of networking the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service takes on special control.
The FAS has established an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the management of the control of residential, construction and natural resources of the FAS, Vadim Solovyev, said that "the current calculation of the amount of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory basis makes the pricing untransparent and can lead to unfounded cost of construction, according to the FAS.
The cost of the construction of the state-owned facilities in the design phase is to be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of today applied accounting standards and single estimates for technological operations.
These proposals have been submitted to the "road map" and are currently being discussed in the minstro.
“The replacement of the traditional accounting documentation in construction on the calculations of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadiem Solovyev explained.
After all, every bult and hike is now counted in the stock, and it’s not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unfaithful construction companies can burial “total tractors”.
I agree with the FAS.
“The first work on the transition to the calculation of cost by constructive elements is already there: methods for the calculation of prices for constructive solutions, the preparation of accounts by these indicators have been developed,” said the head of the department of urban construction activities and architecture of the city department, Elena Zhukova.
The road construction area has been chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe the problem is much more serious.
As said by RGB, the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demianko, accounting norms have long been outdated, but another mechanism of business has not yet been proposed.
"As for the proposed calculations on the constructive elements, it is difficult to realize in practice, as completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings," he says.
It is not a secret that the building market develops largely thanks to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of the NP "Expert Community of Public Procedure Professionals" Yekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Vice-Director of Engineering of the Industrial Capital Construction Centre of Rosatom, Vladimir Malakhov, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible provided that access to contracts will be as much protected from someone’s control influence.
The expert council proposed to form the system of the state order in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
Minstro believes that this approach should be assessed from the point of view of the impact on the business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to provide the customer with the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of the customer and budget expenses for its content.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will have the knowledge that allows to assess the quality of the work performed by the subordinate organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
Furthermore, this approach can lead to the flow of highly qualified participants in state purchases due to the lack of interest in receiving a state order for the incomplete amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The head of the expert-consulting center of the Institute of Purchasing Alexander Evstachenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
The applicant must indicate the "specific indicators" without indicating the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "minor", "analog", "or", "type", "analog type", "not below", "low", "high", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can", "can"
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by subordinate organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstachenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work through the participant’s “paper” offer at the stage of application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is actually possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even been performed, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed by receipt.
The expert council also proposed to transfer marginal income from the top to the bottom, so that intermediate contractors disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, the State Secretary, the FAS Deputy Chairman Andrei Tsarykovsky believes that this is not worth doing, as the general contractor must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will happen, as in the famous repris Arcadia Raikin "Atelier": "There are claims to the purgers?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children on the territories near the Gaza Strip went to school again on Monday after they spent the summer in bomb shelters, when missiles and mines dropped on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was restored after the fighting.
The start of school lessons brought a sense of joy and anxiety to the missile victims settlements in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the Pashosh Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, took traces of the walls and children's hills before the students arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're looking forward to the future," said Ronith Bart, a resident of Kibuz Saad and a teacher of English at his school.
Many of the children in our area really need to return to a dimensional life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she began to go to school again "a little strange."
“It was a hard time and we didn’t get out of our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a cubic near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, leaving to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to rescue themselves from missile and minomet fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, settlements near the border with Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a piece of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education that some families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was strongly struggling from the Palestinian fire.
He advised children to carefully learn and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited cessation on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas’ demands to remove the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seafood ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put the weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
The new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinian side and the UN estimates.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of the killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence confirming this claim.
From the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants launched 4591 missiles and mines across Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, at the time, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 25,000 people found asylum in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, officials responsible for education last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
“I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children around the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the schools in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the highest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a total increase in June, July and August by 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than twice the growth in 12 months before August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawles said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-level market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the last year, while in Melbourne - by 11.7 percent.
The next power markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose from five to six percent.
On the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditure decreases, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawles said that now, when the spring begins, there will be an increase in the number of real estate exposed to sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current conditions with low interest rates, the cost of housing is likely to continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold industries and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century since the time of construction has virtually not changed, unless it is old.
Foreign people go here as to a tour, and the residents suffer more than they are glad, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Uphim house, the walls of which are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building has no little 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, scratching stairs.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls shocked, and the street is visible in the light of the blurred castle.
Everyone seems to be on a sincere word.
And the locals say, “You don’t think it’s so.”
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the state guard, but the money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poor, but the foundation is overwhelmed.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and wash once a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be happy under such conditions?
The road passes right under the windows, even there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana lifts the curtain.
Now we see what before was only heard: the flow of cars is carried under the windows.
Look, the glass is constantly shaking, we can’t open the windows, and we’re used to the noise.
People are accustomed to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live three with a son.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, in the second floor the roofs are a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to go to a neighbor from the apartment No. 6 Ludmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitality woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a single-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: we and our husband and daughter and grandson.
I’m here since birth, there’s never been another living place, – Ludmila surrounds the room with his eyes: anthresols, two sofas with the letter “d”; on one of them was a grandson with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the roofs are beautiful, "historical."
But it runs from the roof regularly: the water system is not suitable anywhere.
Ludmila talks about her apartment ordinary and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it cuts into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we made a small kitchen in a cottage and a toilet from the former hall.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
The Property Center of Ufa says that privatization has no meaning.
We only get a single-room apartment, we can’t claim more.
Four months ago we were promised to displace, but the promises did not go further.
I’m not used to complain and I’m not going to.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment: my grandmother with grandmother, my mom with dad, I with my husband and my daughter with a granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats run through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flegel, they are meters of thickness!
They say the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks Demidov!
Probably just that’s why no one has been killed by a roof or a roof.
Only the building is still slowly dying at our eyes: the panels and bridges of the house are dirty, the fields have failed repeatedly, we have swallowed the cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a cement.
They say, there is, under our room a secret slope and a walk to the White River, which was specially made by the ancient believers who lived here so that it could be hiding from the danger, in any case.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starostin tells how some historian came to them, asking him to let him start the excavation in the apartment.
Then he persuaded to give them a housing in exchange for his single in the prospect of October.
Ludmila rejected the historian:
Where are we in one?
And there is a little hope that the housing will be more spacious.
If we agreed on exchange, we would not win any more.
However, the family of the elders did not win anything.
Ludmila's biggest dream was to displace them, and her daughter and her 16-year-old grandson gave them a separate room.
That is, two families have divided a two-room apartment instead of the non-major ruins in which two generations live today.
The cute, miniature girl Olesa Karsakova from the apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two narrow rooms of a total area of 23 m2, named by the apartments, lives her large family.
We are seven people, two children.
You can see what conditions are.
The shell is wrapped with pieces, like the windows frame, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms cross holes.
The water is only cold throughout the year.
Going through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the most lucky of the spouses Lavrentyev from the apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You are right, there is a lot of place.
Room of 75 squares, prescribed for three people.
We live precisely in the rooms where Suvorov, according to the legend, stopped during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitriyevich Lavrentyev.
The roofs are high, wide.
One bad thing - everything around throws on the shots, breaks down, breaks down.
The neighbors probably have told me.
The most of the torture we have with the floors: the wooden plates shrinked, the earth literally went out of the foot.
I put the supports, the clay; in the hall nothing else, and in the other room we walk, as on the roofs we climb, so everything is shake.
About the house of the buyer Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitriyevich can tell the best of any tour guide.
The gold industry is treated as a parent, speaks about it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was untouched: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, flushed weapons and clocks, held Ural mines.
The inheritors of shopping real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they do not want to live under one roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, says Alexander Dmitriyevich.
Then around there were wooden rooms for carriages, cabinets and carousels, which were subsequently removed.
In 1968, we wanted to remove our house, but something stopped...
The story was repeated in 2014: a new housing was repeated again.
We, according to the team, collected all the documents, escaped the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the transfer to the apartment was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don’t believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Basharakhstan to find out about the fate of the house.
The residents did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a laughter, they issued a paper without signature and print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the displacement of residents."
I even had the feeling that our house has long been not in the city plan, since first it was under the number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had been removed in the 1970s.
The "Russian Planet" addressed the leading sector of information and analytics work of the management of land resources of the Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of displacement of old housing.
I can’t be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to destroy all the old houses, despite historical importance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully carried out.
The houses are planned to be displaced in new apartments soon.
According to Barabasha, the restoration of the House of Demidova will be the Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy is the architectural binary, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, the official says.
The house will acquire a proper appearance that corresponds to what was before, three centuries ago.
The House of Demidova is likely to be a museum open to everyone who wants.
In addition, on the government level, the decision was made to make the street on weekends walking.
In the wake, unfortunately, it will not succeed, too much load of roads in the city.
To displace people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current.
Only from another era.
A forest fire began due to the storm.
The dry storm was the cause of a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting area forestry in the Fire District of the Primorsk Region.
At the place of the fire there is an increase in the grouping of forces and resources.
According to information of the KGSBU "Primorskaya airbase", the conditions created at the fire site require the attraction of the forces of aviation.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in a difficultly accessible area, was discovered by a pilot-observator from the board of the patrol aircraft An-2 on an area of 3 hectares.
The remains of wood are burned on the old burner.
A strong landslide of the territory and a curvature of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable landing landing fireplaces create significant difficulties in the dust.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The supply of the airbase's available forces with the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four firefighters were quickly deployed.
The main task of the specialists is to throw the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and firearms.
In the area of lunch in the village of the Hunter by helicopter additional 3 firefighters were delivered.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area will be ready, specialists will be thrown to the landing site, the site of the administration of the Primorsky Region is.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I’ve never said “I love you.”
Henry was one of the seven children born in a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationships were limited.
Henry is training a comedy, "Rare Reds of Rudi", which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grown up from a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are vivid.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother’s death there was “a lot” of treatment, in addition, Henry often thinks about his relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve just heard his voice, “Stop the noise.
Distance from the sister.
They shaken!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, walked with him to a pub and talked about things like the shape of a glass of beer, the beauty of a cricket hit.
I have never talked to him so.
He was such an unhappy guy in the corner that read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithium workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what his life should have been.
Now there’s a little better, but it’s dark, smoke, the depths of the labyrinths of the upper side with flames of fire and smoke and a lot of cage.
My father slept into the bathroom and just lie there, and you heard he slowly begins to sing about himself because he wanted to wash out of the lithium workshop.
When I came there, I realized that he did this years and years to earn us for food, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry went out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, “I love you.”
Only when my mom got bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
I am 22!
with Don Frank.
Why should I not be friends with her?
She is a great mom.
They are still great friends with Frank, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why should I not be friends with Don?
She is a great mom.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well, and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness exercises, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very hard.
And that is boring.
No one is eating carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is reflected,, in his noble, short-cutting border.
Since he received the recognition of critics for his Hotel, he was completely immersed in the theatre.
She followed "Comedy of Errors" and then "The Commands" of August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an inseparable attribute to his saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
Digi noticed how he parodied on the scene, and wrote about him in "New Faces".
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s: "For a long time I was the only black parodi/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
I didn’t just have to grow in the eyes of the audience, I had to learn to be an efficient joking machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in 'New Faces' in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Show of Managers, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face," Henry discovered that he was performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it much.
I seem to want it to never be with me, but I don’t regret that I did it.
Although it was a strange, judgment-worthy position, I worked on large fields and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "winning the awards of light entertainment classics on British television years and years" was also "a grotesque parody on black people."
Representing the characters who were trapped over the black culture in the UK, and singing it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of "Lenny Henry Show" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, Chef-Chef Gret Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
Advertising videos, documentary films, television series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series “LennyHenry.tv”, he thought, “What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit that you’re pulling the time or slowly turning down.”
Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 titled “What’s good in...?”
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I can’t say that I’ve been hardly taught this at school, and I thought it was, in a lot, the prerogative of middle-class white people with cracks and cracks down in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, “You have to try it.
Do not blame it until you know what you are talking about.
Speak some of these words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Monologue of Otello for documentary transmission, and he caught it.
I felt that I could do that.
Soon my head was fixed.
“What this is, it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the process of repetitions was hard, and I read this plot months and months before we put it.
And she had success.
They seemed to have been waiting for a catastrophe, but it did not happen.
Soon we started a comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn’t believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
A technical failure emerged, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
A quiet voice inside me said, “You’ll have to work for 10 minutes as long as they make the computer.”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation will be renewed as soon as the problem is solved.
I left the scene and something in me said, “Oh, thanks to God.”
This is not my duty.
I can let someone else understand this.
“You play in the play, stay in the role.”
Henry in The Forgotten in the Theatre of Daeches
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Combs".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was also well-accepted, so it was like a sign above, indicating, "What you have to do."
Of course, he says it with a big voice.
So I keep that.
I really like this.
I like to be in the training room.
By the way, Henry still has the thought of the comic - all the way our conversation is interrupted by the blows of his humor, when he begins, he ends parodiating.
I just decided not to work in the standard because this thing with receiving instant remuneration from a full room of strangers, I think is quite dangerous.
If you are trying to do this all the time, it can lead to foolishness.
Sometimes I work at "Direct Broadcasting in Apollo" when I want, but mostly I don't get the same pleasure as before.
I’m asking if he’ll give the stendap tour again.
The pleasure of sitting in a room with a director who helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the way – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up.
Is this his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It is a pleasant fun.
You’re always telling a story, and here’s a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registrates Public Officials to Identify ‘Invisible Workers’
Kenya has launched a biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “unseen workers” from the government’s payments.
Employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in state structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month is missing at the expense of payments to "unseen workers" and other financial breaches.
The government suspects that wages continue to come to bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, reports.
All public officials must appear within the next two weeks in the identification centers to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure.
Anyone who does not do this without a respectful reason will be excluded from the payment notice, it is in it.
“This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of government officials, and will also be used to purify payment knowledge at both levels of the government – thus, put an end to the problem of ‘unseen workers’,” said Anne Weiguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structuration of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with a "convention" against the government
Only 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for suspicion of "confusion against the government," the local news agencies.
Police have not immediately commented on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurrieth Daley Newz.
Some of them took part in corruption detection measures last December, which was aimed at inspecting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for suspicion of creating a organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power, the Islamic Clerk Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools opened again, but that he will do everything he can to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony did not take place in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole Ukraine, the enormous united Ukrainian folk front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastuchov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which the daughter of Yatsenyuk went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally establish here and that the children will get the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of the school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear high shorts, hold air balls in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In Ron's face, the BBC may have found such an impressive manager she needs.
She follows a slay of glory from the world of banking, the administration of the media and the internal circles of the Party of Tori.
In fact, she has her own experience in the leadership positions.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years after resigning when a senior post in Pearson's headquarters was occupied by a lower man's colleague.
They say that their earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also different.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became a counselor of the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband was former counselor Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman’s work a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public anxiety and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is a unavailable duopoly, which requires a complete radical reform.
However, what new president will risk to come, destroying and destroying the institute as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself loses his work in this process.
This is a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult, many people will be happy to see how the BBC will decrease in size - after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors shrink the circle and new technologies challenge pleasant old habits, inevitable negotiations on the cost of the license pose a special danger for the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquires a share in the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is obvious that the popularity of Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today against 31 percent 10 years ago.
The patterns of viewing and using the BBC have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman – I hope he has found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone stranger
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Governor Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of a district prosecutor from Democrats who is at the center of criminal prosecution for alleged abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, and followed by another one from the Perry account, in which the record was disguised.
Just from my account was posted a tweet that was written by someone stranger.
"I don't approve this tweet, and I removed it," the post later said.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the messages with a request to comment.
Although the records were uploaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was unclear who was actually posting on that tape.
The earlier tweet contained an unpleasant cartoon on the district prosecutor Trevis Rosmery Lemberg, who was accused of driving in a drunk state in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding from her office when she refused to resign, which led to a major jury in Austin's trial this month against Perry, who is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
“I don’t always drive a car in a state of drunkeness, three times higher than the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do it, I am accusing Governor Perry of saying it to me.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Board did not conduct an investigation with the participation of a large jury against Perry.
They were taken by Michael McKrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not acknowledge himself guilty and called the accusations a political fraud.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in the case to reject the charges, saying that the law used to persecute a governor who performs his duties for the longest time throughout Texas' history, will displays that is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding of $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in the district of Trevis and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto has raised an official complaint from a public control group with leftist views.
The Perry confirmed account tape is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Being fifth at the party congress in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to rumors that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here are we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal" state
One of London’s most famous builders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England “returned” to normal activity levels.
Houses in the capital were the subject of vibrant demand and rapidly rising prices, while concerns were widespread that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidjli, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to its normal transaction level since the peak of 2013,” adding that it provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market succeeded during a decline as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent in one last year, according to the Land Cadastro, significantly exceeding the average rate of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes rose about one-fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London’s real estate less attractive for foreign buyers, some of which also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “home tax” before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agency Foxtons last week warned that the April mortgage market reform, which has been introduced to stricter terms of loan, will also lead to a decline in market growth both in real estate sales transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its London real estate price growth for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis of the fact that the real estate price setting has already begun to weaken.
The volume of transactions at the same time dropped by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales for more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pygli added: “The demand for the good product with a good design and the best location remained the previous and, reflecting this, sales for time remained.”
In June, the company that it sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April – almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual earnings before tax payments rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income - by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking in front of the company’s annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pijli said that Berkeley’s expected revenue for this year will meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, profit is expected for the whole year before the payment of taxes in £450 million.
The Berkeley stock price stood at £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence posted on the internet by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The photographs of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar, have been posted on the internet by a hacker who claims that she has the "catalogue" of the photographs of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine, and condemned the hacker for "nude invasion of the personal space."
The law enforcement authorities have appealed and they will pursue anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally displayed on the 4chan photo sharing site were supposedly obtained due to the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the hack includes the names of the jungle of women celebrity, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. All” Winston on Twitter also condemned the kidnapping.
“Those who look at the photos we made with my husband a few years ago when we got home alone, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winston wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Jastis from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-Winner" denied that on the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos naked me FALSE, people.
Let me stop it in the grass. *Calambur intentionally*
Buzzfeed last Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos on which it is supposed to be authentic.
Exclusive breakdown from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which caused the critic's praise
They dissolved, best to say, they gradually broke down, like a carton box they left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, hard in communication, stressed, closed, and a little irritating.
Then she pressed his hand.
He saw an irritation in himself.
He was like a puppy, yes.
The last victim was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and even some satisfaction.
Eyline Solomon was a tremendously fragile beauty with shrinked hair and a tremendous heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a satellite older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter was in her inheritance a house in a raw, but similar to the paradise valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The tubes flooded, the spiders still sitted in the baths, the mucus left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew up with shrubs, similar to the giant cappuccino.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the 2014 Booker Prize long list.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Keverne and Eyline sat, holding their hands, in the broken shellings among the high grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both split up to the cheap console, which supplied the country with peaceful music and calming news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black artist, which his father loved to listen, leaving the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
Due to their own aggressiveness, the songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They were not prohibited - nothing was actually prohibited - they were simply not lost anymore.
They helped to become archaic, as the word “archaic” itself.
The public taste did what would never be achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich, the poor, the culinary books and the love novels, from all the music they chose the ballads.
Relaxed on that day, Kevern began to play on the imaginary piano and a brutal comic voice to sing the big legs of Eylin.
Eilin did not understand.
"This was a popular song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically applied two fingers to her lips.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it slides from his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was small.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forgetting to attach two fingers to your mouth, and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was waiting for him, and that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eilin has never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although it was not openly prohibited.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one place in life if.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It is exactly the same with sharpness.
His unpredictability affected people on the nerves.
And jazz was sharp, expressed by music.
Although he reached the age of 10 and never heard of Sammy Davis Younger, Kevern knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret compact disc collection.
But at least he didn’t have to say to Eilin that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and that meant that each segment agreed with gratitude – thanksgiving to those saved by the fate – with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the field of entertainment and sports - and they sing and run.
The outgoers from India, as if they were naturally talented in everything about electronics, took the effort to ensure that none of the families remain without a working e-phone.
What remains from the Polish diaspora was the sanitary work; what remains from the Greek was the plate.
The outgoers of the Gulf and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country when THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE
Everyone by abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eylin was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern just lied to her could be placed on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
“They aren’t really offensive,” Kevern said.
Per for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the planned garden gave him an illusion of safety.
None of the words could penetrate through the sound isolation of giant leaves similar to the cappuccino.
Allan did not understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press two fingers to her lips again.
She already considered him strange.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
She confidently climbed her head, closing Kevin's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the coins of her black hair.
Nothing he would like to look at.
“Well, if you say that,” she said, staying with her opinion.
But it doesn’t explain why you’re singing it.
She seemed really annoyed.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can’t say no.
The boats, maybe a bit.
And you say you hate me because my boats are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don’t hate you.
This is just that stupid song.
He could say, “I love you,” but it was too early to do it.
“I like you just because you have thick boats,” he tried to say instead.
I have such distortion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempts to joke often led him to an unpleasant situation, because, like his father, he lacked the calming charm that could relieve the cruelty of the joke.
Per his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, also wanted it.
Despite good eyes.
Eylin Solomon was red and stood up from the shell, throwing the console and flowing the wine they drank.
Wine from the buzz, so drunken could not serve him as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be drunk like palm leaves in the hurricane.
“And I like you just because you have a foolish head,” she said.
Even though you don’t like it.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive cruelty of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her sight when she gave him resistance.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that in the main features she was similar to her.
The same huge ice ocean collapsed on them both.
The same disinterpreted men, even more sensitive and caprice after THAT HAS HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE
A foolish head?
They would show her a fool if she wasn’t cautious!
First to kiss - kiss now has become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the anti-food from the fresh ballads that the console issued - first kiss her, and then hit her.
Overdetermination, according to Kevin, because kissing itself has already been a humiliation.
Eilin Solomon's body showed that he had to leave.
He rose out of the shell as an old man.
She herself felt the swing weight, but the weight of her anger surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched how he went away, and from the top window she watched how he went away, her satellite was a man who took the burden on himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion to him and men at all, although some of them raised her hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a swallowed back, held, struggled, all the ability to fight left him — why did she seem that she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would see that?
Again one Eilin Solomon looked at her legs.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around that, Esma Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, an informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence in the most parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop completely, taking into account the means and forces that were allocated to eradicate it.
“Many things have been done, and many things are done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the inherent aggression of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won the majority of them, especially among these narrow branches and the narrow settlements of the area, where, despite the buriing over the towns of the churches, the gentle breath of human goodness was rarely felt throughout history.
However, some qualities seem to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire would seem, the lower the passion it generates.
The population is throwing tears over the sentimental ballads, throwing stories of the overcome obstacles and declaring its dull faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old cruelty keeps its strong capture in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there are also evidence that new and evil harshness is born in homes, workplaces, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” said her head of science, reading the whole report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esma Nusbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I think I don’t have to answer,” Esma Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esma again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
a feminist?
Silence again.
“I’m asking,” Luther Rabinovic said, “not because I’m against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
There are no prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praiseful by themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you are predicted against the church, and what you call “bad” and “gravity” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural life love and energy.
Continuing to get bored of what has happened, if it has happened in general, as if it has happened, if it has happened in general, yesterday, means depriving the country of the vital power it needs.
Esma Nusbaum looked by the sides while Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingo, LED letters repeated the advice that Offnaeus gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk by phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you want to say,” Esma Nussbaum quietly replied when she confirmed that her scientific director had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything but that we didn’t get healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the errors that originally led to THAT HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS
Only this time we will throw out our anger and uncertainty on others.
Luther Rabinovich joined the ends of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture had to mean endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “calling the errors of the actions that our grandparents did or did not do.
You’re going too far and when you’re talking about they’ve thrown out their “great” and “disconfidence” on “the others.”
On your place, a person should not need to remind that, understanding the past, i.e. defending the present, we don’t talk about “we” or “they”.
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of trouble - that's all we know.
“For which, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esma dared to insist, “no part of society can well justify itself.
I do not accuse anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done is done.
It was then.
There is nothing to say, we agree here.
And as you don’t have to blame anyone, you don’t have to be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn,
The past exists so that we forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
The Pyramid of Luther Rabinovitz collapsed.
“I’m going to review your report,” he said, leaving her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went out on the trail, as the passengers described, "in evil anger."
Accidents are happening.
The Lesotho Army says the coup was not planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the fact of preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying they acted against the police they suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabané has left the country, saying the country’s army has surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in the capital Maserou.
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he was threatened with a life attempt.
The army representative Major Nthelle Ntoi said that there was not a coup, but that the army was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whom the police tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took measures after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to arrang chaos,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monella said the military’s actions looked like a coup.
"Al no one has claimed the capture of power by force, according to all the information, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at this moment have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the Lessoto Army that the soldiers returned to the castles on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Taban.
Tabané said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tensioned since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government despite the accusations of the opposite.
Chelsea semi-defense Marco van Ginkel will hold the upcoming season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch man will arrive in Italy in the near future for a medical examination.
In the last season, he has only been on the field in the London club three times.
Recall that earlier Milan had rented from Liverpool the attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the Eurozone at the lowest in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the Eurozone’s production sector by Markit fell to a score of 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and enterprises suffered among the growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
It was announced before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will expect the bank a clear plan on how to deal with the stop of the recovery of the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
There is an assumption that ECB chief Mario Draghi may later this week give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the euro area, similar to those used by the UK and the U.S. during the financial crisis.
“While some growth is better than any growth, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more obvious,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s production sector, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months with a score of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to raise real concern as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth impulse has dropped mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also don’t add confidence,” Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to overcome the oil in the fire for analysts expecting the introduction of additional monetary or budgetary tax incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight’s chief economist, said: “The best thing we can say about the August study of the Eurozone’s production sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension obviously hit the business – and the consumer’s confidence – and likely leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said, “It is more and more like that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some kind of quantitative mitigation, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Inhabitants of Mariupol will set a live chain against the rebels
In Mariupol until last week, everything was quiet - no one was worried to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of the “populations”.
According to the version of political scientists, separatists break through to Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea - recently the city of Novozovsk was taken, which before it was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolans decided that the Ukrainian army, though, would defend them, but the forces had a little against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LNR, and gathered to help the military.
They rise shells, build blocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand inhabitants came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and take equipment and products, collect medications, publish newspapers.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are ceased to work.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Besslan: Ten years from the horrible occupation of the school, as the children who were in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken as hostages by Chechnya militants at a school in Besslan, south of Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We returned to Besslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during school brutality.
Just ten years later, after the terrible capture of the Bezlan school, during which 334 people, including 186 children, died, heroically survived the catastrophe warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed something like the extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in hostility, which surprisingly then turned into action and hope for the future in the conditions of severe fears.
Ten years later, we returned to Besslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who deceived the death during the cruelty at school.
We have found amazing young people who have faced trouble, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now suffering Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now end.
The girl on the photo tries to get back to the shooting sports hall
She was captured on a photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Beljakov, when in one clothes she tried to get back to the shooting sports hall after the explosion of a mine.
In disappointment, Aida desperately sought her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
“The woman told me to flee, but I couldn’t,” said Aida.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and looked back in to find my mother.
The soldier took it and took it to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I may need another operation.
A few pieces remained in my knees.
Her goal is now to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it, of course, didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“This has happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to this sports hall to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my school and start working.
I will think about the family later.
She says that capture remains with her, although memories are slightly tightening every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the internet where I’m leaving in the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and do so that it doesn’t happen anymore.
The boy who fled through the city bullet believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (Russia starts school at 7 years old) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to go, if there is a explosion, and keep her in the hand."
After one explosion, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, “Go.”
Fearing that she was dead, he fled and on the way saw a crying baby, took the child for his hand and fled through the city of the bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught his son from the outside, said, “Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with wounds on her legs, in turn thinking her son was dead.
After their reunification, she said, “I was crying from joy.
I couldn’t believe it.
He escaped and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now unexisting News of the World), where he was awarded as the Child Defender from the Barnardo's Foundation Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror returns to you every day, but I’d like to be able to stop remembering it,” he said.
I can say that in my memory, he is shaking.
I remember how immediately after that I threw out all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and it’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the children with whom I played in the yard, who never went out.
We never say they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and a trip in a car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror returns to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was volunteer last week in the women's monastery.
So I want to help.
I want to serve in the police one day and I hope I will be enrolled in the academic next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence immediately after the capture, just there were no children who would cry and run around, and that silence lasted many months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damire to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I would like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Damire and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to eat a borsta, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the officers in the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water pistol, and they fled and played with him.
It was a month after our nightmare.
I was surprised by the fact that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I all think this world has not been better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children as ours.
I think, for many people, war is a news report they hear when they’re tired or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of this.
I can’t stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or evil at all.
He doesn’t look for revenge, for example, he’s not in the nightmare of the past.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this – I remember how he was lying on the sofa, turning away from us, for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he thrown out all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I’m hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I’ll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stood up on my feet, I looked, I saw the hell around me, when parts of the bodies were all over.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember I cried to him, ‘Damir, run, flee,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
He heard and fled.
So life for us continues, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyn, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after capture became decisive for the tragedy in Besslan
Peace: the surviving Besslan Georgy Illin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and the case of Georgy today
On his bloody face was a footprint of fear when he was saved from death, when Chechnya terrorists shoot his classmates.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Bessalon.
His mother Fatima, 54 years old, head doctor, took him to school on the first day of his study before taking Vladimir's older son to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists fled into the courtyard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not all alone, there was the family of our relatives, but all of them were killed.
Only Georgy survived.
The closer this date, the more difficult to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we don’t remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it’s happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time have me in front of the eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgy so wanted to go to school that day he said he wanted to embrace the teacher.
I only learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the crying George in San Marino.
Georgy doesn’t like to look at this photo, and it’s hidden in the library of our home.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It is important that this never happens again.
I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never find out the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was caused by?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to pass to forget it a little.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I dreamed of nightmares because of capture, but now it’s getting better.
I came back to school later in 2004 and I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I continue to go to this sports hall before every 1st of September.
I want to give a gift of memory to my old friends of childhood.
It’s hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget it, but I do not regret myself.
My life continues.
I graduated this year and entered the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.
I will learn to become a cardiovascular surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the legs of a terrorist murderer
Incredible: Georgy Farniev was at the legs of the terrorist-killer during the capture, but he still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the legs of a terrorist murderer.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study for an FSB intelligence officer but failed because of the damage that was caused to his health during his capture.
It’s still with me, it’s not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children can easily deal with bad events, I have to say that it's not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the next year - was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show where I sat on this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with a photo open on a laptop of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
As for physical condition, I am healthy.
I have to be cautious with a knee that was damaged, but now I’m walking normal.
But yet my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical findings, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals “from cats to cows”.
He said, “I know I’ll never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said, “This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and be present at the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know that George will not go.
For him she should be even stronger because he was there and I don’t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned to me. Here in Bessalon the footprint lies on everyone.
He remains with us.
George is now an adult, but that nightmare is still with him.
It’s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He’s a boy, he loves sports, but he can’t do them because of his knees.
He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50 percent, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift that God could have made to me, but my heart hurt for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know the widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life continues, even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world – wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it was possible to catch all the rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Alena Zkaeva, 10 years old
A boy who was taken to a safe place by special forces.
Rescue: Alain Tskaev is carried to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces (left) fighter.
She is now ten (right), and she doesn’t remember the monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian police officer pulled the little Allen out of the school in Besslan.
The terrorists released her, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahara in the school’s gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Allony's mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they and his new wife Svetlana have a little daughter he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Allena, who is now ten, doesn’t remember anything about capturing and flourished into a smart and lively girl, the neighbors say.
"They are a big happy family now, and Allena and Mahar are both beautiful children," a close friend says.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the 10th anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
The semi-defense Syndhi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, said he was looking forward to coming out again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a pleasant event in his career.
Of course, I’m very happy to be playing for Borussia again,” Kagawa said.
I feel very well.
Full of positive emotions and I am looking forward to being able to come out on the field again in the form of Borussia.
Kagawa passed to the MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he has never been able to fix himself in the English club, performing in two seasons only 38 matches in the championship of England, scored 6 goals and delivered 8 resulting transfers.
A man accused of getting on a girl on the pedestrian passage "Pelican" in Fifa
A 78-year-old man will appear before the court for the accusation of attacking a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian pass in Fifa.
Gordon Stuart allegedly killed a girl on a passage in Pittenville in East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stuart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and shot the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his fault in the Sheriff Court of Dandy.
Sheriff Charles McNear, the royal lawyer, has appointed the date of the trial to January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be charged in Vladivostok
The duty free trade store at Vladivostok airport has lifted a table that prohibits a number of world political leaders from making purchases in this store.
Do not load them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japan's Prime Minister and several other famous comrades will not be able to load themselves with vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And he hanged the corresponding table on the door.
Earlier, Obama was forbidden to appear in the even less available for him in the kind of service facility - Dietary Dinner MGU, which was by the site of the food facilities.
Whether the American president had a dream of ever eating in a dietary dining in Russia, it is not known, but the authors of the ban clearly seem to themselves terribly intelligent.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the conditions of the embargo Russian farmers should acquire new technologies in order to regulate the production of demanded from buyers varieties of cheese.
The advice was given during the visit to the enterprise "Yugpticeprom" of the firm "Agrocomplex".
The head of the government also advised restaurants to reorient on Russian meat, whose quality is at the right level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted training for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - says "Every sport" the words of Maslakov.
The third place is the confirmation of our fairly high team level.
It is a pleasure that the advantages of the French and even the Americans over us are minimal.
We have to keep in mind that we were not prepared for this competition.
The season is over and we don’t commit our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the team.
The French, on the contrary, showed a combatable team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly announced publicly.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition was unable to confront the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some types were in order lower than in the same "Diamond League".
The season is finished.
Of course, the results are no longer so important for the athletes, especially in team level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it was absurd when at 1500 m men were so interested in the tactical tricks of running that they showed the result below the average level of women’s races.
4 tips to get the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or take a video under the water, you have a wide range of equipment options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "mile", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these photos on a family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of around $350.
No matter what equipment you use, you need to follow a few rules to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera’s battery and other sections are closed.
Also, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you’re going to take.
Some photo and video cameras have capture modes or object type that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, find out how deep your equipment can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, while others are 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our customer guide and digital cameras ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few pictures because many of them fail.
The "mile" has a reservoir that will help you make pictures, while the action camera usually does not have them.
Even if you have a fluid, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the composition of the picture will be a random process.
Do some staff.
Also, if your camera has a series capture mode that captures several images with a slightly different exposure settings, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly decreased, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you’re shooting in the pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more colors on photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Get closer to the objects of filming.
This is a great advice for landing, but it is even more important underwater due to dark light conditions.
It’s especially important if you’re taking on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to get closer to the recording objects if you want to fill the picture.
The bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics on free struggle Billy Machov can turn into the Greco-Roman struggle.
This was by the head coach of the Dagestan team for free struggle Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Mahov is on the collection of the team of "classics", - said "R-Sport" the words of Sajida Sajidova.
In general, by the junior, Billy performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the volcano tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on the free struggle.
It has long been talks that the new stage of our career will be our hardness in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I’ll say more: Mahov can play at the World Cup in Tashkent – if he wins a break.
But the decisive word is always behind the coach's headquarters headed by Goga Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a person whose personality power could swallow everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
Consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to releasing patients from both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife remembers, was a MI-6 officer who had to live with the destructive consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are interested in diagnoses and diseases, those who are treated mostly worry about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he found himself the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel as usual,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting symptoms like flu, he found that he irritatedly blamed his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left the affairs for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and uncomprehensible why he was annoyed.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a X-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier he climbed on skies in the French Alps.
The X-ray results have come.
It was a mesothelioma, an unhealing cancer that affects the pleure, or the lungs membrane.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from lung cancer, for example, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But with the mesothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fiber building material, which was once called a "wonder", but which is now known to be fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can not pay attention to.
Asbest, in the end, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe-isolers, builders, strawers and doc workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is unlikely to be a cause of anxiety today.
This calmness is wrong.
The UK is now at the peak of the epidemic of the mesothelioma.
Here more people die from mesotelioma than any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of approximately 2500 people, more than twice the number of people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesotelioma since 1980 and forecast number of deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly consequences now is that although the use of asbestos is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately banned by law in 1999), the development of mesotelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of the mesoteliums is not limited to the veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go for shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of availability, profession or age.
The Bastions of Selection, from fashionable London uniforms to private schools, seemed not a rescue.
The building is covered by asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have been the tanks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a tuberculator.
In fact, he had to think where he could get into contact with asbestos.
Then he understood.
“It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Hague hospital where I spent six years in the stage,” he wrote.
All – students, nurses, doctors and carriers – used these tunnels.
How many of my colleagues are suffering from the same disease?
This was a question to which he, unfortunately, could give a partial answer.
“Four of the doctors who have been trained in the Hague hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he said in a 2010 letter, “I am one who has remained alive.”
How many of us are suffering from this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesotelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us are suffering from the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on the Mesotelium in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people do not think they will die in this way.

A quick view of reports from the court halls, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotelioma attack spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Janis Ellen had been exposed to asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments on two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I never heard of mesotelioma, I hardly knew about asbestos.
I could not even think that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos are not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestforms", which means a fiber structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotyl, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor plaque, thermo-isolation pipes, coal swaps, even in brake wheels of cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as "a serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocidolitis).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are weak, although indirect reasons to believe that this is the main cause of the extremely high number of patients with mesotelioma [in the UK]".

Jenny Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of a mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pito makes it possible to assume that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study, which allows to assume that "a significant percentage of mesotelium, when there is no known impact at work or at home, was most likely caused by the exposure of asbestos from the environment."
The majority of this impact, he says, is due to the "common use and weather impact" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the center of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, the fiber of which could be brought into movement something as harmless as "strong air flows".
Parliamentarians are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Department of Parliament's maintenance insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "clean sanitary certificate", it has now recognized that it is necessary to do £1 billion work on the reconstruction of the parliament, improving the electricity and removable asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, parliamentary members may be sitting in the QE2 conference center nearby, not on the green rocks of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that “the situation with asbestos was not managed according to different rules.”
It is not possible to find out if this error of management will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practice doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that was successfully submitted with asbestos,” he says, “but I can’t prove this in my case.
It is so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is that it was the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that was like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late evening.
Suddenly I began to get hot.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn’t walk the whole way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the membranes around the lungs.
However, like Jenny Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesotelium.
He could not go to work for a month.
Confused doctors made X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he did sports and hard breathed.
In 2011, one of Ebott’s patients came to him in a reception room with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with a mesotelioma.
But even then, Abbott didn’t link this with his own case.
After all, his patient was dozens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Ebott’s condition worsened again, and his consulting doctor showed his CT results and X-ray images to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced into the cavity between his chest and his lungs.
I am optimist.
I’m usually just going further,” he says.
I did not experience it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, survived.
The result of the biopsy came on a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was a mesotelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott drowned in a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which offered him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It seems asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermoisolation was quite frequent on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in untypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-isolated tubes in hospitals were in the floors, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many employees who walked through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or eaten in the underwater dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) almost were really exposed to a toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that was a life threat for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Students installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos
This is not just a hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and municipalities because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools as well.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Thro the country, on countless chemistry lessons, students installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos.
There have been websites that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things, such as the floor plate or the roof of the sandwiches, normally contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison that is deposited in a huge number of our buildings,” says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against the Hague hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the drowning of garden saray in the 1970s.
Therefore be careful to wear the garden shells.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is unhealable, is enormous.
“It takes a lot of time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and deal with myself.
I will not meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor’s position to the patient’s position.
As the countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he was broken with the amount of information that was to be taken.
“It was difficult to realize everything,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, “Well, I’m not going to meet Christmas anymore.
Here is everything.”
Mesotelioma is dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we maintain life - the act of breathing itself - causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbest is made up of small fiber.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fiber is inhaled, they can lock into the plumber, the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleure and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises because of the inhalation of asbestal fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiovascular surgeon who arrived in 2001 at the Hague hospital.
It is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, by the irony of fate, the leading center for the treatment of mesotelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while staying in the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "the breath takes them out to the periphery where the membrane is located.
This is an invasive process from the beginning.
The usual options for the treatment of other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of the surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some think it is worth trying.
The treader disagrees.
“It’s impossible to cut the plow,” he says.
It is impossible to get around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is “not very well suitable for chemotherapy” which “acts” but does not cure.
“There are sick people who live long from time to time,” Treger says.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen J. Guld died 20 years after the diagnosis was made.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was sick with mesothelioma, Abbott was met with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after diagnosis, unilaterally turned into a support and consultation office for the same patients.
“Allo, Cancer Central,” he lively spoke when they called.
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six chemotherapy cycles that would take four months and extend his life for just a month.
“I was desperate,” he said.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson, “willed to give everything a slightly more positive color.”
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunsky, Professor of Toral Surgery at the Hague Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me,” Graham said.
The average patient would have to get guidance and approval for financing.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is inevitably ineffective, many patients face another financial reason to worry - about the future of the families they will leave.
And then they appeal to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was what became clear that even very small amounts could be at risk for health.
It was then that they talked about the unfairness of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and the Hague Hospital, in the end, resolved the case, but it wasn’t a “full-cost regulation,” according to Morgan, since Lawson couldn’t clearly prove that his mesotelioma was the result of contact with asbestos in the Hague Hospital.
After the investigation of his death, a spokesman at the Hague Hospital still confirmed, however, that “asbest in the flooding premises that was discussed was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking a fatal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - was a big problem for patients with mesotelioma, requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers changed the owner or closed.
The insurance archives could be lost.
And those who are defended against claims know that on their side the time that the applicants, of course, do not have.
In response this year, serious new legislation came out, which facilitates the process of collecting compensation for patients with mesotelioma, even if their former employers are impossible to track.
According to this law, a £350 million fund was created, funded by the insurance industry, for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who is not with whom to be judged.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could allocate in the ordinary case of compensation - about £12,000.
Approximately 300 successful requests for this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many people who work with mesotelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by the insurers for the insurers," he says, suggesting that the amount is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the temporary interval did not interfere and the patients with mesotelioma would be able to track the company and file a claim in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “uncomplete”.
However, both Penning and Morgan acknowledge that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
“People suffer so heavily and they need help today,” Penning said during Bill’s second reading of the mesothelioma in December last year.
Until then, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loyka Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended a surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radio therapy and chemotherapy - triatherapy, in which Lanzhou-Lazdunsky can pride with a total of 40 percent of the surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt a flow of strength.
“This is, of course, one of the most important things,” says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott was operated in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
The subsequent scans did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I was scaned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I just had to be 50.
It is not a life threat.
This is the end of life.
And again Abbott passed six chemotherapy cycles.
There is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finance when I die, for example, or what to show the wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
You have to look forward.
Like his father, Ellie, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for my parents,” he says.
It’s hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I won’t live until age.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn’t say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancers have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma such discussions are not balanced with hope, even the problem of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen J. Guld) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mezotelioma is not a life threat.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite the growing demands of a democratic reform.
This move is likely to set a start to long-loved protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began planning and mobilization within hours of the statement.
The decision of the All-Chinese Assembly of People’s Representatives, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“This did not deceive our expectations, but it still leads to anger,” said Emily Lao, the Democratic Party chairman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They cheated the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the All-Chinese People’s Assembly, said that allowing an all-national appearance to the Hong Kong leader’s election would be too “caotic.”
Since 1997, when the UK has transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the residents of the region to vote for the head of government, starting in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongs the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process strongly in their hands with the help of a candidate nomination commission, strictly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when some of the most extensive and widespread protests in Hong Kong took place in many years.
The Occupy Central with Love and Peace has threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee a genuine universal voting right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain before the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, obviously seeking to avoid problems with government bodies.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "thought on the possibility of capturing the central area only as an exclusive measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very pleased to report that today all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and the occupation of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement for a few days, and on Sunday, security measures were strengthened in the government's headquarters with police and barricades attracting.
The foundation of the disturbances is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control over their own city.
The flow of residents from the continent increases competition in the field of goods and services.
It also increases the fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to weaken under the increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are at risk for the business – a source of Hong Kong’s vital power.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said Legislative Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want the concern to spread that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investments.
The Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days in which the Hong Kong Democratic movement activists were shown by diversists directed by Western powers.
This summer, the activists organized an informal referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780000 participants – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
American culture of graduate balls comes to university life: primary students were offered to arrive on a private plane
We are delighted to respond to such demand by launching the first UK travel service category "Luxury" for current students.
To leave a bright impression from arriving at the university, the company also offers such transport options as a private plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service thought about safety.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In combination with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company’s representative said that since the service was just launched, the orders have not yet been made, but added that “students will begin to order this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite the fact that students need to pay £9000 per year for their studies, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what you need for that.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as distracted from reality.
Megan Dun, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly distracted from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month are faced with a life-value crisis when available financial support in the form of credits and grants fails to follow rapidly growing costs on basic needs, before they can begin to think about spending thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival in the hostel.
The feminists raise the question of raciality and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, saying, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while they wait in a row before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noticed a shift in the internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists, leaving comments, put gender above raciality when it was about promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw the answers of white women, who were 100 percent focused on raciality.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of August 9, personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts about Ferguson from the face of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there’s a lot of people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we’ve faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to racism, they felt that it was to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the Ohio State University of Coryta, Mitchell Ferguson narrated the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s happening to me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colourful people are attacked in their own country, silence is silent.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public security?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality issues in the history of the United States, there is no dicotomy between racial and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were linked, and the basis for this almost always served as the rape of a white woman," Hatther said.
It needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lining.
Heather’s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white supergirlists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 18th century and saw that the struggle for the voting right would be effective only for one of the groups: women or black.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should have appeared later,” Hatther said.
A look back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colorful women don’t trust white women.
We did nothing good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained their voting rights in 1920, it took ten years to unite white women against lining in the Southern Women’s Association for the prevention of lining.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects the time when white feminists had to “go” the problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
“Truly, would it be great if activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they treat the right to contraception?” she asked.
The second wave feminists, who have made their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what it means.
The famous white activist of the feminist movement Gloria Stein, two weeks after Michael Brown’s murder, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in the protests on racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger that lies in the body – and the views on racial problems that differ substantially in public surveys – will be the leader of change,” she wrote.
Though Stajnem is mourning for more cross-border feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments about the race in America still surprise some.
The researcher of the American Entrepreneurial Institute, Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the Ferguson's Secret Rings are contrary to the criticism she expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, “Friend to my brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young people, a angry reaction from many feminists, including from Gloria Stein, followed.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem promoting the advance line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwestern border this year, the immigration reform has again emerged – this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present this problem as important for women, she just needed to share the stories of women immigrants.
“They speak for themselves,” Merkel said.
When the overwhelming majority of work visas are issued, women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a response from women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipsvitch house "with a pig" is sold
The photo of the house for sale in Saffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it was painted a big pig resting in the living room.
Exhibited for sale for £12,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living house - on which a pig with a head resting on the sofa was shown.
The real estate agency Connells that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
“But the photo was posted by error and has already been removed,” the company’s representative said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of meetings as "a unique separate house with one bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig is sold with the house.
The Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open withdrawal Karolin Voznyatsky, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to dignifiedly complete the year and try to get out to a new level, reports Vasily Osipov from New York.
How do you generally evaluate your results at the Grand Helmets tournament this year?
I’m glad I’ve won Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I didn’t have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now I am, of course, annoyed.
He couldn’t even reach the quarterfinals.
What tasks are you facing by the end of the season?
After the offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to do and I am going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a few weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed for compliance with the standards of the WTO to give bonuses when entering the university.
According to him, in general the norms will be the same as in the Soviet time, people will give the norms on pulling, running and other exercises.
12 subjects of Russia will begin implementing the GTO norm on their territory from 1 September.
I also proposed to the students who gave GTO to give bonuses when entering the university, Valouev noted.
For example, you can add a bit of points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to give additional output to the workers of the enterprises who have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will get home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday evening.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, the previous winning amounted to $1 million in November 2009.
However, the successful winner still has to declare himself.
The store owner Steve Forward said the win caused an agitation in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a victory could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winning of the main prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a Kenning Wale player became one of the five millioners in August, following a $7.5 million win by a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before that.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire has raised the number of winners of the Western Australia Grand Prix to 59 this year, with a total winning amount of $85 million.
Economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally clean transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Ministry Oleg Plujnikov on the round table, which was held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan is drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - early October, Plujnikov says, the proposed measures are related to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-motor fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is available at "Vedomosti") is scheduled for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transportation and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally clean vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the preferred loan and preferred leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to lower the prices of cars, to stimulate localization and to create service infrastructure will be prepared by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (on parking stations, car charging stations, etc.).
Furthermore, federal officials intend to formulate for the regional authorities during 2015 proposals to also encourage the use of environmentally clean transport – in the form of providing it with advantages in movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 – and proposals to extend the state purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will enter the list of indicators for the evaluation of the activities of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of ecologically clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia is only forming - in 2013 around 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duties on electric cars were annulated, so the sales will make about 500 pieces, predicts Mitsubishi Motors CEO in Russia Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars somewhat noticeable: in 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
For now, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports – the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Renault’s director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia, Nikolai Remiz.
Most other electric transport manufacturers have taken a predictive position towards Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also available to Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, ", but the production is poor.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the expensive electric vehicles, recognizes the director of "AutoVAZ" engineering Sergey Amanov, without the domination of the breakthrough in this segment will not be.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to expensive cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average two times more expensive than the analogues with internal combustion engines) prevents the undevelopment of the charging infrastructure (charge - units), breathes the general director of "Autostata" Sergey Celikov.
Due to the expensive and low rates of decrease in the cost of electric vehicles in the coming 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, the head editor of "Autorevy" Mikhail Podorjansky predicts, Celikov agrees with him.
Automotive manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of the usual.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to integrate the confidence in the consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the appearance of all new charging stations, emphasizes the chairman of the BMW group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rosnetti": several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of the supply network are also being conducted with other regions.
According to the director of "Rosnetes" department Vladimir Sophina, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build supplies throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, "Rosneti" as a network company has no right to deal with the sale of electricity, the possibility is being developed to do so with respect to the charging of electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of domination of the formation in Russia of the electric vehicle market the upgrading of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in force until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension and extension of the preference list is being developed.
The replacement of transport tax on ecological (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov says.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the reduction of the tax has led to a sharp growth in the sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, stimulating measures are needed for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Bankov confident, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on the specified tracks, which in Russia is not yet available.
Private plane crashed in Colorado
The Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors are taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the departure line of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In the Donetsk region are negotiated with prisoners of the Donbass Battalion.
The caratters were surrounded by Illinois.
They were entrusted by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were killed under the shooting.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was in the southeastern part of Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
The caratels of the Donbass battalion remained alive after the “missrube” they hit under Ilowaisk.
In the surroundings of the Army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters that from the "ring" it was possible to go out through the allegedly provided corridor, the column was moving.
But literally in a couple of minutes, missiles and bullets came from all sides.
“Judge according to the information I’ve been given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out,” said I.O. Deputy Commander of the Battalion, who had the call of Lermontov.
And when we descended to the bottom between Multipol and Chernobyl, a cross-fire began with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with "touchs", 30-mm granatometers, automatic BMD rifles, shooting weapons.
There were four cars in front of me and three behind me, and there were only two cars left.
The officer called "Lermontov" tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, many died later.
The survivors are now provided medical care by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them badly, give food, medications.
At the time that their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to faithful death.
We’ve been betrayed, they say.
The column, the entire battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei was a volunteer, because in Ukrainian news they talked about the brutality, which was allegedly caught in the south-eastern "separatists".
Alexis has seen a different picture.
His mother in Luhansk was killed - and not anyone, but Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend called me, told me that there was a minomet shot, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexey.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Illinois, they said we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about the departure.
With the fees from Zurakhovo, we were fortunate to Ilowaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were arrested in the "cottage" under Ylovaysk.
Now some survivors admit that if it was possible to turn the time back, they would not enter the punitive batalion for anything.
All the prisoners were transferred to the forces of the DNR.
Everyone is checked for involvement in war crimes.

Economy News – Will Kiev “Rosnefty” replace $140 million of losses?
Rosneft’s chief Igor Sechin said the company estimates the damage from the Lisichan NPZ attack in Ukraine to $140 million.
This was in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage to $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the introduction to operation of the modernized company Lisichansky NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no battles, there were no “covered rebels”, but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial object.
In addition, the technological oil attached to the pipes has disappeared,” he said.
On July 18th, in connection with the attack on the Lisichan NPZ, a tank for oil storage was burned and the two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansky NPZ - the main oil processing plant in Ukraine, the first round of the enterprise was introduced into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan NPZ is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The factory is capable of producing fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as the Euro-5 standard diesel parts.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to Lisichansky NPZ was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to begin repairs.
A year later, "Rosneft" received Lisichansky NPZ along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
North Korea launched a short-range missile toward the Japanese Sea.
According to the South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to the United Committee of South Korean Staff Chiefs, the missile is believed to have crashed into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls on the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew at the opening of 3 cop. to 37.15 rubles, the ruble dropped to the currency basket on the background of geopolitical tensions.
Trading on ETS by dollar began with transactions within the boundaries of 37.11-37.2 rubles/$1, in an average of two minutes the rate was recorded at the level of 37.16 rubles/$1, which is 4 copies above the level of the previous closure.

The price of the currency basket added 3.5 cop. and was 42,395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading 23 copies above the official rate, the euro 16 copies above the official rate.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
It continued to cheaper and the ruble and even updated the historic maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, for now it is more like artificial hysterics, swallowed through the media, especially the western.
The possibilities of introducing new sanctions to the Russian Federation are not so many.
On the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the bilateral basket.
Geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we don’t see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian index and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
“Orenburg Airlines” will be judged with “Ideal Tour”
"Orenburg Airlines" presented "Ideal-Tour" claims for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
It is about two matters, the meetings will be held in October.
The cases will be discussed by different judges.

The second application was submitted on 18 August.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 2.
As to journalists in the Russian Union of Touring Industry, judges in cases are appointed differently.

Director-General of the airline Victor Zyukin says the amount is 1.6 billion rubles.
The Director-General of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, calls an even greater amount – two billion rubles.
Twitter is trying to become more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the user registration process to engage new participants in an active interaction with the platform faster.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microbiologists.
Now new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to make their reading cycle immediately.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated at the registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets the subscription headline for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the bullets so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only the avatars of the recommended users, then now Twitter takes a sample of one of the popular bloggers' tweets to help make an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily associated with the continuing efforts of the service to unprofitability.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in the readers activity.
The company at the moment desperately needs more loyal consumer resources, which, once, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be bright and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainforest throughout the day, the meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in Sub-Moscow - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy with clarified weather places will pass rain, the wind in the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The vehicle recycling program has been renewed since September 1st.
From September 1 in Russia, the program for the recycling of cars is renewed.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated to these goals.
As the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through re-distribution from other directions of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo.
Previously, a similar vehicle recycling program was already in force in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is proposed not only the recycling of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility in case the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new with discount when the old is delivered to the "trade-in" from the dealer.
For the previous federal recycling program, which was in force from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, more than 16 billion rubles were spent.
Thanks to it, the level of production of motor vehicles in 2010 was approximately 1.2 million units (this plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, famous for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game about modern journalism.
He told about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began to work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only become widely known now.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teen.
The focus of the project, which has not yet a name, will be how the information enlightenment of stories affects their consequences.
The game’s hero, the civil journalist, will have to photograph what’s happening in the areas where clashes occur between the police and the population.
The hero can photograph differently what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he takes the scene so that the policemen look like heroes and the protesters are bandits, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where a normal person can’t go.
If he will illuminate the events differently, his photos may turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
Glasses in the game will need to be picked up with the help of the Twitter character, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos placed there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of release and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event can change depending on how the photo was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he was thinking about the concept of such a game quite a long time ago, but initially he wanted to dedicate it not to the U.S. protests, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media lighting the events in Ferguson, he decided to make the game based on the motives of the event.
Nikki Case is an independent developer that produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his relationships to the homophobic parents.
Heletey pushes Ukraine to continue bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next "thousands of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey draws the people into the continuation of a bloody opposition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“In Moscow, of course, the attention was paid to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Heletey, who declared that the operation for the liberation of the East of Ukraine from the terrorists was completed and the beginning of the ‘Great Patriotic War’, in which losses will be counted by ‘tens of thousands’.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his page on Facebook the mentioned post, is a subject for the research of specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On informal channels, the Russian side has already repeatedly threatened that in the event of continued resistance they are ready to apply tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the "Operation for the Liberation of Eastern Ukraine" was completed.

During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to return the former working conditions that were recently changed.
The increase in wages is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the temporary minister of justice Christos Ivanov.

The military controls the new government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defense of the Government of Wongsuwan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chang-Ocha, has announced the formation of a new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than a third of the positions are held by generals or resigned generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chang-Ocha was officially approved as Prime Minister after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the temporary military government for this post.
The 60-year-old soldier, who took power in the country as a result of the immaculate coup on 22 May, was the only candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at the meeting of the Parliament.
The army has previously appointed members of the parliament.
According to Pryuta Chang-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six-year demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinatown’s government.
Officially, Praut Chang-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen their power in the country.
Military arrived on May 22
A total paralysis of civil authority.
The leaders of major political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military arrived in power, they were temporarily arrested by the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyuk Chinavat.
Some journalists and public actors were also arrested.
The current political crisis leaves its roots in 2006, when the army withdrew from the post of Prime Minister brother Yinglyck Chinavat Taksina.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly provided them success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite entered the anti-government movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the salad will be better, I didn’t promise that, a servant from the new Palm bracelet is found.
It is formally to acknowledge that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain continuous.
After all, everyone has long known: we say "Belgium" - we mean media, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium".
The restaurants like to deeply say that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: it is location, location and again location.
There are such places located not so good, and even great, but some unknown.
Shortly, sitting behind the Palm headquarters, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Horodok" (in honor of the same television broadcast), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Božole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Over the ground was placed only the top of the iceberg: a bar stand and a pair of chairs, the rest of the space is deprived of even an indication of sunlight.
But it’s fun here, as in the children’s room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows – TVs, where girls swim.
The Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long been not new, so compare food with what.
There are eight types of brewing beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and countless bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer pleasantly presents the menu, telling that "midias are saturated big seeds", and it should be noted: the service, despite individual shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but often very unexpected by execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that the meat roulette with valon black (280 rubles) is actually a carpacho, cut to the same so thin that the pergament paper compared to it will appear to be a matter unfathomely thick.
You can feel some taste only if you mix the potatoes together.
The salad is worse.
The classic Lezh (260) would be the most correct to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some dried iceberg, once long-cooked potato, cracked Kenyan beans, clothed beacon chips plus somewhat marinated cabbage.
With such a salad you will not wish to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close the eyes on the unrealised quarters of tomatoes or overwhelmed champignons, then why the midians look like they have been able to freeze and dried them several times in their lives!
After all, I already know, there are quite normal white sea media here!
They are submitted in cushions "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Souls of half a day, the one that made of white wine, sandwich and carrots, openly did not give up.
There are vegetables, and the smell is missing, and whether there was wine there, it remains a mystery.
But good reliable on myths with domestic mayonnaise.
Chicken wheat here is not a snack, thick to such a degree that depending on the mood you can decide the first or second dish before you, and just a pleasant salmon soup.
It was said that the rabbit local cooked in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
At the end, the situation was diametrally opposite: the rosemary hidden everything.
It was impressed that this rabbit during life was fed exclusively with rosemary backs, why meat gained such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit's foot was attached to a wonderful - no, just an abolished grape in a caramelized crocodile.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also saturated - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clay sauce was overwhelming, and the vaffles were dried.
But the manager, who came to the table, was very informally concerned with the meal impressions.
So it is worth coming again.
The price of the dollar has risen to the MMVB above 37 rubles in the news of the West’s preparing new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar by calculations " tomorrow" at 10:29 Moscow rose by 26.9 copies and was 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 copies - to 48.73 rubles, the data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events the dollar reached its maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36,43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
In the night of August 29, the White House that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble has a long-term character, both in the pair with the euro and in the pair with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this note, says Alpary senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Everything that has to do with Ukraine will be reflected on the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today the rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talks that he was resistant to such news were overwhelmed yesterday.
The week, according to the specialist's forecasts, will close around these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of the transit of gas through Ukraine - all these are the lines of one chain.
Inflation is also predicted: the current prices for autumn will increase from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and some vacuum will come as long as the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
“The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there is no powerful hysterics,” said the head of the market analysis department of the “Opening Broker” Konstantin Bushuev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then news went over Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week stated that until the end of the year it is completely moving to the floating rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was nothing different from the previous during this month, everyone was scared by the mark of 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
In turn, nothing strong has happened.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I remind, when in the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as the third of March, when the Central Bank dropped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is an increase in the income part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers through the increase in imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexey Kozlov.
Negative points can be the travel of import goods and services.
The sharp volatility of the Russian currency significantly decreases the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provokes an increase in inflation pressure and, as a consequence, becomes a cause of loans of money, which, in turn, inhibits the development of the country’s economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the devaluation of the ruble slightly slows down the price of the shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index during the Thursday trade dropped by 1.67%, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative amount of index decrease is explained by the weakening of the ruble over the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions fall to no, and ruble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We assume that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," said Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
She said she spent many years thinking she would die after a wrong diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage age thinking that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had the disease of Sharko-Mari-Tuta (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and the spine.
The charitable organization CMT UK that the incorrect diagnosis is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are supposed to have SMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walking and pressed leg fingers.
Patients may feel discomfort or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's ataxia (AF), a state for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be attached to a disabled chair when she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I was falling every day, and I had more time for everything.
I could never ride on rolls or skateboards with other children, and I had to be a lot deceived at school because of how I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the Achillus joint and straight the legs, she looked at the medical card when her doctor came out of the room, and there was written that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I swallowed my nose where I didn’t go, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I returned home, found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I got the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most horrible panic as possible.
I thought I’d be in a disabled chair at 18 and die before I’m 25, and that I’m gradually losing all my abilities in that interval.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that at the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this illness because you’d already be in a disabled chair.”
I think you have something that poses a much less threat to life.
After several genetic trials, she found a MST.
“When he explained what the SMT was, I thought she took a happy ticket out,” she said.
The Charitable Organization of the UK has announced a month of information about the UK to try to attract attention to the disease.
Tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington Zone is growing as the economy is recovering
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country have increased moderately last year, when the recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are not an exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in state and local treasures in the financial year 2013, 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burden on state and local business last year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the next year when accounts decreased, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, the tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 percent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of the tax revenue in Maryland is taxed on firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
A great increase in tax revenues is caused by the return to the previous level of company real estate value, researchers say it raised real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of these revenue comes to major states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same happens in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, a $9.6 billion more than in 2012 – a 4.2 percent increase compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of value on real estate has no similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by state and local level in Maryland, where real estate taxes hardly exceed one-fifth of the company’s tax accounts.
Companies in Virginia and District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs either to the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also appears to go on amendments, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared corporate income tax at state level of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.
Although the trends are targeted in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three regions.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the country average, 4.3 percent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Only in Virginia, tax revenues were seen to rise below the average, equal to 4.1 percent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (every one has the same corporate rate) was 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs by state and local level and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The area was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to the tax revenues targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small in the Washington Zone seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes by state and local level, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurs' taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure on which the majority of small are built - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much greater growth rate than the taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and growth in business tax revenues throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with tax revenues in state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be delayed as the decrease in federal expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The domestic judo world championship brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the Russian team.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favourite of the competitions - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Besslan Mudranov, who played in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final struggle with Boldaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one commented by the Russians.
But the second day of the tournament became the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg of silver came to Mikhail Puliayev, and bronze to Kamalu Han-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russians defeated the 2011 and 2013 world champion, the Japanese Masasi Ibinume.
Han-Magomedov, in the quarter-final stage losing the co-powerman, won the comforting tournament and became the winner of the bronze prize.
In the female tournament category up to 52 kg also to the third stage of the pedestal honour reached Natalya Kuzyutin.
In the semi-finals she lost the current world champion Milinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship played under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze Kuzjutina won with Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended she still admitted that the third place is not what she was expecting.
And again the obstacle on the way of the Russians to gold became Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze was placed in the copper of the Russian team by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was the former representative of Moldova Viktor Skvortsov, who now stands for the UAE team.
However, the Russians then won two matches and became the winner of the prize.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with a trauma of the neck, which he plans to cure in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for the former Moldovan Skvorcov, he and he at this tournament reached the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his peoples who accepted the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with a bronze, completed his performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won by Ivan Nifontov.
In the hard battle of the small final, he by commenting at the rival defeated the French Alan Schmidt.
On Friday at the tournament were played at once three sets of awards, but the Russians traditionally limited one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Voprosov, with the team of Russia this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the comforting final was the co-powered Kirill Denisov.
However, the struggle itself did not take place: the opponent was unable to get out on the tats due to the injury.
The male bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of the competitions - it was placed in the cup of the team by Renat Saidov, who played in the category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting final he gained a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moore.
This ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both male and female - were one of the main candidates for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were not lucky - they didn't get to the medal.
But the Russian Judoists conquered the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation they in an enduring struggle with the count of 2-3 passed the main favourites of the competitions - the Japanese team.
At the same time, the team of Russia led 2-0 after the pure victory of Han-Magomedov and the volunteer - Denis Yarcev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals were unable to cope with Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
According to the same scenario, a bronze match was developed in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, gave up to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was present Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament greeted the male team with silver.
“The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,” Putin said, whose words are quoted by RIA News.
To lose the Japanese, the Jews of Judo - there's nothing shy here.
But I am sure you can win with them.
The team of Russia at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at the competitions of the same level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all great maximists.
I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, he is the potential winner of the Olympics.
Moreover, in such a form of sport as judo," the results of the tournament were submitted by the Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will be held in the summer of the year in Astana.

Family Joan Rivers hopes for the best
Joanne Rivers is unconscious since she arrived at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
“Thank you for your constant love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart attack in a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources report.
Doctors will deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict surveillance until they will satisfy her condition, which remains “hard.”
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can be king.
In sale the debut album of the group Royal Blood - a new hope of the British rock, which brought the rock duets from the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duet is on stage for a year, but has already been nominated for the BBC Music Award, an Arctic Monkeys tour and a visit to the New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut same-name album in a few months before release received 100 thousand pre-order, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the Major-Leble Warner Music.
Given the current unpleasant situation on the music market, the situation is out of a series, since it’s not about the new Lane Del Rey or the next sweetheart representative of the “new R’n’B”, but about the duet of bullshit Brits playing with the level of noise and intensity that last was in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the bets on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were high and were already quite justified.
The duet took the name, which before it could be applauded, unless the very desperate hair metalists, and the blood of the kings flowing, as they think, they have in the houses, is also clear.
It’s, of course, first and foremost about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quarter, Royal Blood puts its goal to throw the standing blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make forecasts about the success of this company is probably early yet, but something can already be affirmed.
A dozen songs set in thirty to a little minute are not as a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let’s say, the pilot single “Out Of The Black” is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a bubble party.
The musicians in a joke say that this song is easier to sound than to sing.
It is also worth distinguishing the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing album composition "Better Strangers" with Shakespeare's quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound perfectly at the hard rock lovers party, but when lost in a row they merge into a more or less homogeneous plate.
And it is not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The power of Royal Blood is that they don’t claim the labyrinths of the new Lennon and McCartney (referably put into the successors of Motörhead), but have taken out numerous rock duets from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for the stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously close to it.
The secret is partly in the smart use of the bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the zero retrocity were hardly selected beyond the post-modern paradigm, with a huge disappointment they went to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and sharp that this effort successfully draps some secondary and solidity of the musical material.
Who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.4 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what Information on Friday morning: the online store – and the video producer, and a hundred other things – is buying the streaming video playback service Twitch for $1,04 billion ($970 million).
This news was a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of the Twitch video service to Google for a good billion seemed completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set its goal to be a streaming service of a general nature – a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their inside-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "Let's Play", the genre of videos in which all-known give (mainly old) games processing, as in the "Mysterious Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when described Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was found without a particular interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to the available information, it was ready to pay not less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shira: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snowboards like me who say they’ll be better doing sport than watching it, it’s hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick into their hands.
One thing is to look through the shoulder of a friend at 3 a.m., when she goes through Resident Evil, and another thing is to see how a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are aimed at one person, so watching their shot, without controlling the angle of sight by itself, can be a recipe for headache, worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passes in which the Roger Bannister of our electronic age finish the whole game in record times are entertaining.
But if it’s not about game virtuose or humor, it’s unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How does Amazon work on this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will fall into Amazon Instant Video as elegant as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would like to get: a crowd of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Broad said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of games,” and this channel does not give signs of deception, even – oh – as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 terror attack, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Bessalon.
Talked with the survivors - almost all now students, with the parents of the dead, with the cemetery observer - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Besslan" Susanna Dudijeva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the MCS, - says the correspondent of the "Community" department Elizabeth Antonova, who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, they met with Islambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the president's adviser for the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "B" FSB of Russia, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What shocked me especially during the time of working on this topic is that in Bessalon it was as if it didn’t have been these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has any attitude to it, people hardly agree to talk about what has happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But forgetting Besslan cannot be done, and I hope we have managed our task,” Antonova said.
The special project is prepared by the infographic studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s presence in power.
North Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, Ranchap reports.
The launch was carried out around 10.30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, located on the border between North Korea and China.
It is believed that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea, flying about 220 km, the United Committee of Headquarters of the South Korean Staff said.
Members proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The State Duma submitted a draft law that provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of the Russians - from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed on the basis of the legislative activity of the lower Chamber.
Its authors were Deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Justice Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more efficient and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and the observance of the secret of the correspondence in the information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which comes into force by parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation the personal data of the Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes mandatory recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extract of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in the databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called "black lists" of sites-criminals - an automated information system "Register of infringers of the rights of the subjects of personal data".
The law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrey Lugoy and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Daygin and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay for the rental.
Commenting on the draft law presented today to the State Duma, the first deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said that he does not see any problems for transferring the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by 1 January 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of the Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "to the "Rostelecom", who has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rental and already provides their servers, to the Mail Group, to the Western companies that today already provide their servers."
"There are also several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies make a decision to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I don't see any problems - they will get technological possibilities for placement," Levin said.
controversial draft law
Immediately after the draft law was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that in the event of the draft law, the Russians will no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, it is concerned with the online booking services of air tickets and hotels.
According to the Association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their registration, systematization, etc. should be provided only in the databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The statement emphasizes that the more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism of informing the user about where the recording is carried out, systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to decide on which territory these actions will be performed.
The adoption of such laws on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to global services and significant economic losses.

Ukrainian soldiers transfer more than 400 prisoners
The Army of Novorussia claims that the Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down and accuses the enemy of violating the agreement on ceasefire.
On the 10th of September, the rebels delivered 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were injured, and the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorussia.
He added that "forces of air defense in the area of the settlement of Mereshki crashed the aircraft Su-27, which violated the ceasefire agreement."
According to the spokesman of the agency, the Ukrainian side during the artillery strike of the Lugan airport applied cassette ammunition prohibited by international conventions.

Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take responsive measures in case the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take responsive measures aimed at defending its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
In a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry it is said that the "conclusions" of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the failure of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of the invisible support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, relying on "absolutely proofless statements about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry said on the website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry expresses regret that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the counterparts," the ministry said.
There is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a massive humanitarian disaster has occurred, and the number of victims among the civilian population is increasing.
In the coming seven days, the European Union is planning to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with U.S. officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the introduced measures with each other in terms of the period of action and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Fast ways to save on university books
While the cost of university tutorials for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schröder, who will soon go to the second course, has invented a smart way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them a nominal compensation so that they can postpone their sale.
“My mathematical analysis curriculum, which is usually worth $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a “Chick-fil-A” cookie,” says Schröder, 19 years old, who studies at the Covent College in Georgia.
The required literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on books and educational accessories, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schröder system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often costs significantly cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book sales has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Mayer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University shops".
Here is the introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable transaction.
Purchasing in the online store
Sometimes, if you go out on the internet, the price of a new book may be one-third of what you will see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of the Mathematical Analysis of Ron Larson, Bruce Edward and Robert Hostler costs about $290 per pre-student, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of books.
Purchase of the subject
If you’re not against the disturbances or injury of others, the bookmakers are a good option.
The "Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 on Chegg.com.
Matt Cessadey, 25 years old, a fourth-class student from the University of Brigham Young, says he paid on Amazon.com 42 cents for receiving a copy of the "Media Strategic Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Braysi, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, suggests students to clarify from their professors whether they cannot use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are irrelevant for lessons.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small portion of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to purchasing purchased books.
Rental
About taking books to rent, it is worth thinking if you’re good enough to deal with them, don’t forget to return them and don’t want to leave them for yourself after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student could rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may be charged for notes, highlights and damages.
If you rent a book, remember: if you don’t return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic Books
Electronic books instead of traditional books are another option.
Sometimes these books are rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" rental on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Breissy says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
Despite anything, check out.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to figure out the price of the book as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an order on the internet, says Golt, make sure to check if the book is actually in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says the Far East Development Fund is completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the domination of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective.
“15 billion rubles are still on the deposits,” the president said.
During the meeting, the head of state ordered to accelerate the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, until 1 July so has never approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport availability of the region, removal of infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for the development of exports.
In addition, it is necessary to create forecasts to attract additional investments in the region, as well as to form areas of advance development that should become competitive with regard to key business centers of the ATR, the president stressed.
It was previously that the territory of advanced development could replace the OECD.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save cash fees
Sylvester Stallone has returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget to the U.S., while The City of Sins: The Woman Who Worth Killing has returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's movies such as "How to Draw the Dragon 2" also disappoint the earnings.
The article of the film critic of Telegraph Robbie Collin points to the fact that when it comes to children's films, it may be a matter of poor quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 the worst year in history in terms of children's movies, and called "How to Draw the Dragon 2" a hardly "functioning" continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to movies aimed at the audience a little older, it seems that the problem is not necessarily as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average rating of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each movie released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the Day of Remembrance in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, make it possible to assume that the harvest of this year’s films is similar in calibre to the past year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be about changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Fawro, who is currently working on the newly renting Disney film "The Book of the Jungle", told Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times are changing."
We must acknowledge this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current drop in cash fees in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for too much relying on comic franchises, and predicted the Hollywood crash.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that in his dark predictions there was a portion of truth.
Due to the fact that several potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including The Avengers: Age of Altron, Minyonov and Jursky Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
"People X" producer Simon Kingberg recently called the fall of cash fees simply "cyclic," said Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will be worried about it."
Products sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for European and Japanese cuisine restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general government still prefers to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a low-salt garlic than a bad mozzarella,” the chef of the Italian Barlotti restaurant, Mariano Valerio, discourages about the quality of the cheese offered by suppliers in exchange for the Italian cheese.
Mozarrella and Burrat cheese ended in the restaurant first, they have a short storage period.
The reserves of parmesan should be enough for a couple of months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005 I was on the Drogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories don’t let him go yet.
The meat was on the vessels just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
The rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything on the Russian markets.
I don’t know, maybe now everything has changed.
But a few days I was brought to the test of a fish from the Far East.
So she was thin!
I said I don’t even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is hanged in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It should be swallowed to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then I was asked, where did you get that sweet meat?
I said, that’s your own, Russian!
Why does no one do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stoplist that indicates the missing foods: French snacks, seafood.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strailer" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the bricks from France have already replaced the bricks from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, “Why, on what basis is it so expensive?”
They say, “We have to make money too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern eyelids we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, do you imagine how much their pancreas weighs?
The price is that it is super delicate.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scratches for foreign cuisine.
The standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality dropped sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can’t endure stable calibre and quality.
Many European cuisine restaurants don’t know what will happen when the cheese stock is over.

The sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia’s security, which are mainly referred to as food sanctions.
In the country it is forbidden to import beef, pig, meat and sub-products from domestic birds, meat delicates, fish, milk, yogurt, grapefruit, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, potatoes and sugar syrups.
The restaurants have started the deal with suppliers: the prices of the products have risen, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
This will most impact on expensive restaurants with monochines in France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
It had to be reconstructed earlier.
For example, when in early 2014 Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers ordered the supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer 2014 were much more serious.
On 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the prohibition of the Atlantic salmon and forel, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, cabbage and cabbage for seed.
The Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions may be further mitigated.
Some of the restaurants are still in uncertainty.
According to the East-West company, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu under what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergey Mironov, restaurant owner, owner of the agency “Restconsalt”.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
We only have very few such cookings, and the development of a new menu can take two to three months.
The trigger from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu - to process.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine already begin to replace dishes, such as a steak of marble beef - to befrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“Sires from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” said Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
Milk and milk products from Europe have similar in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the U.S. can be replaced with a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a losos and a semga from Norway - a losos, a semga, a forel from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: hardly there were gourmets able to distinguish the Italian mozzarella from the Russian.
Although it’s hard to get to Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its own menu.
It will take a lot of time to replace,” says Mironov.
In Ginza the comments were refused, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Coffee owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that foods from former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European foods.
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions will almost not be touched.
These include restaurants from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive foods in the Georgian cuisine,” says Hatuna Kolbaja, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the “Way Me!” cafe.
All cheese for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes is chicken filet, exotic green we do not use.
In the restaurants of Kolbai, no meal has been removed from the menu yet.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chaikhona N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not disturbing: he will only have to change an apple to a New Zealand.
If Russia makes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cut, eggs, tomatoes, garlics, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than “plastics” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
After the introduction of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artykov, said he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the "Money" request, are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
The McDonald's press service said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia suppliers department, about 80% of the products the network purchases in Russia, although temporarily difficulties may arise with the supplies of vegetables and the rise in prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanction products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
They didn’t affect the sanctions and the “Vocker”.
KFC, Burger King, and The Short Cards did not respond to the request, but other market participants claim that the Burger King’s localization is significantly lower than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East fish.
on his gorgeous
At the same time, restaurants complain that due to increased demand, prices will rise even for local products.
"The prices for "Grables" have risen by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," says restaurant director Roman Rožnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants the cost of meals will increase by 5-10%, Colbaya acknowledges.
"Eastern-West" does not deny this: "For example, the Belarusian dairy production has traveled by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have raised the prices of pork almost twice,” said Sergey Rak, Deputy Director of the Stardogs.
The shortened chicken traveled by 35%.
We expect prices from China, maybe they’ll cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, there will be a planned price increase of 8%.
It is very unwanted to raise prices now, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of the revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was just 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to rise, he acknowledges, but it is unclear how quickly: as long as most restaurants have booked their products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the breakdown of the purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the mayor of Moscow there are dozens of shelves decorated with green and wood.
In the center of the scene, the musicians play vals.
This is a festival of regional products with the fun title "There is time to eat."
"We have long been going to make a holiday of local food, and here just the sanctions, we got to the ground, organized the festival," said one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with musicians the cook-greek Anastas prepares a salad of macarons and domestic desserts, in the days there was a master class in cooking a borst with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
Exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Basque, olenine from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-Moscow "Sovchosa of the name of Lenin", cheese from the broken Italian Jay Clouse.
“Restaurant loose can be safely replaced by another loose fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish store “Your People.”
We are hunting the nerve, the keto, the cushion, the gorbush, the cushion - the "King's loose".
Yes, they’re not as fat as the Norwegian salmon because it’s wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hands, he doesn’t even walk.
And our far-eastern losses will not be held in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian Motherella with the Italian Motherella.
In the window of his chamber lies beds with the "Magadan" burk, fever, omul, muxun, midia from Crimea, grapes from the Far East.
Galkin is confident that it is long time to move to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant portion of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The "Swey People" shop has been operating since 2012, it sells fish through the internet store, before sanctions it served another half a dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
Currently, 15 more restaurants have received applications to Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, it is hot.
We got frozen and tried different recipes.
We are currently selling sushi through the online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
For confirmation in Galkin's shadow I'm preparing a portion of Philadelphia with a keto.
Unlike the rolls with the seam these have to dig longer, but the consciousness that this fish is our, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "Your people" there are even roles of palts and sea shell.
In the sushi bars, instead of the Norwegian lossy, they prefer the Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cookers are willing to invent new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us,” Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev explains.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the released niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owners of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily the major producers of other countries,” says Akimov.
However, in the last month the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
According to the results of the massive out-of-the-plan inspections, three McDonald’s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the measures necessary for the immediate opening of restaurants for visitors,” Dengham told McDonald’s.
Indeed, no one knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous employee of the restaurant consulting company.
If they start closing McDonald’s throughout the country, the scenario will be quite different.
"Europrotokol" instead of the GIBD certificate
Cash payments can be obtained without the GIBDD certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the implementation of the "euro-protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft instructions, according to which from September 1 of this year for receiving cash payments the insurance car driver will be able to do without the GIBDD certificate.
It is true that it is only about those cases when the accident was carried out under the "Europrotokoll" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached an agreement on the question who is the guilty of the accident.
From 2 August the limit of payments under the "Europrotokol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be raised to 400 thousand rubles.
The essence is that often even with small injuries, in a situation where the accident can be formed according to the "europrotokoll", the drivers who have fallen into an accident cause the DPS.
After all, in the presence of a police casco to get a refund on it without a GIBD certificate was impossible.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directions are intended to eliminate this obstacle on the way of the implementation of the "euro-protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for the casco in connection with the accident registered without the employees of the GIBDD should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time it cannot be above the limit specified in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is useful and theoretically capable of discharge both the staff of the DPS and the road.
But it is likely that neither the drivers nor the insurers will be excited about it.
The latter already talks about a serious threat of increasing fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will be done to overcome the original Russian conservationism.
The driver in most cases will wait hours for the inspector to form a small accident because it’s so more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat the scammers or convince drivers in the reliability of the "Europrotokoll".
The savings certificate will be named and unreasonable.
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban the savings certificates on the applicant, but will allow the banks to make them an analogous of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates on the subjects.
Recently, this tool is getting popular because the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the savings certificates on the subjector do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and the bank they are cheaper, as you do not have to make deductions to the deposit insurance agency (ASV) fund.
The picantity of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium banks distributing such certificates, and they are affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the assessments of the ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
And the Bank of Moscow’s share, according to the agency’s estimates, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that the customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license, try to get money in the ASV.
Some investors, not having sufficient financial literacy and purchasing savings certificates on the subjector, may assume that their investments are insured.
The reasoned absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there were cases when the holders of the pre-representation certificates tried to collect insurance compensation through the court," the agency said.
The problem, of course, is imagined.
After all, no one will pay to the buyers of certificates anyway, since they have no right to compensation from the state according to the law.
If the matter was that the instrument was not insured in the ASV, it would also prohibit the metal accounts on which the funds of citizens are taken into account in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts are also not included in the deposit insurance system, but no one will try to exist until now.
The fact is most likely that the certificates on the subjector are a very convenient securities that can actually play the role of a quasideneg.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before the release such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not an accident in the bill that the savings certificate must necessarily be a nominal securities that must be stored in the depositary.
And to make the pill sweet to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to premature refund.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable contribution is introduced, which banks have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff council for what was described as an anti-top.
Stephen Fearclow watched the events for us during the weekend and talked to the protesters who came everywhere: from Bridget to Belgium.
Germany sends 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter terrorists from the Islamic State group, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31 with reference to the decision taken after the meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will send to Iraq 30 carrier anti-tank missile complexes "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 strikes.
Delivery will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate an additional €50 million to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will speak in a Bundestag with a government statement on this topic.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to “heat points”.
The opinions of the Germans about the shipping of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others are afraid that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of the terrorists.
Ukrainian police killed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
Donetsk rebels hit the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezimenno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shooting of two boats of coastal guard.
The incident occurred today around 16:20 in Moscow.
Teenagers taken on helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two boyshockers were delivered on a helicopter to a safe place after they spent a night staying in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went on a march shortly after noon on Sunday to Goethe's Lip in Blackhit.
The worried relatives called the police around eight in the evening when they didn’t return home.
A search group was sent, which included local police and rescue units, and the couple were found around 11 in the evening near the Bridal Wayle Falls.
The girl wounded her knees, and the young man fell and scratched her head.
Officers stayed with a couple for a night and raised them on the leaf on Monday morning.
They were taken on a car of emergency in a stable state to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions meet.
Negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were called, but gave birth to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
For the worrying reason (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "heat problems".
Is such a structure able to work effectively, it’s unclear; but it’s clear who removed the slices from this summit.
Questions on this account fell in the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed by them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw in television news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader revealed an example of distorted kindness, it was the behavior of a man who just broke the jackpot - and plans a decent old age in the higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival to Minsk at once of three major European Commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just a legitimation of the president with a 20-year experience.
This is a request for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research Denis Melyantsov is confident: from now on Brussels will not be able to talk with Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met the tete-a-tet with Lukashenko gives reasons to believe that the relations with the EU will be frozen further,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough began by the Belarusian authorities long before the November Majdan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - it is successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and re-admission, dialogues on modernization, - the spokesman "Fire", - and with the U.S. negotiations on international security have been held.
The United States has even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership on them only undermined this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de-yure did not recognize Crimea’s accession to Russia and called for punishing the pro-Russian rebels in the Donbass with all the strictness, did not dispute with Moscow.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or the OECD, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and evaluated it, Belarusian experts are confident.
As successful the movement to political diversification will be, it will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to take meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU's High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels is expecting from relations in a new format.
The press spokesman Ashton Maya Kosyanchic just said to Fire that in the background of the resolution of the matters of war and peace this topic is not a priority.
There were reports that the next place of meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could be Kazakhstan.
A drop of digth for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he, it seems, was personally requested by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all sides are not against that Minsk remains a central place for meetings both in the form of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine, as well as at the level of the heads of states and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" gets the status of a fully handheld European leader who helps to solve a global problem.
The Best Friend of the European Farmers
The composition of the EU delegation, which included European Commissioners on Trade and Energy, has already made the conclusion: the main subset of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the scheduled on the meeting for future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the EU countries on the association agreement of Ukraine with the EU seems to be a achievement more scale than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Hucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives “have come to Minsk to look for a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa.”
It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine is "working" on Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, who is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, former candidate for the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in the way of sanctions.
At the same time, the supply schemes are drawn up, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit pushed Minsk.
“The initiators of these schemes are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked on goods supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not going to manage production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian manufacturers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very demanded.”
According to Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the EU and the EU negotiation platform is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He reminds that the losses of the EU’s agricultural sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated to be 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered agricultors only 125 million euros of compensation.
The President of Belarus may propose Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for euro farmers.
This could raise Lukaschenko’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TSI+EU format is dismissed, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague emphasized that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
“This was your proposal to gather, without any need to discuss, not from the Bay of Barahta to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to deal with the situation that at that moment was in Ukraine,” he addressed Petro Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department carefully emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing the cooperation between the EU and the US on its land, does not pursue useful goals, but the final goal of such a format is to create in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the security sphere, raises and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally – the Russian Federation,” – said Fire at the Foreign Ministry of Belarus, a department where the words are scrupulously selected.
Moscow may have paid entrance zones
The government of Moscow considers the option of the introduction of paid entrance zones as a method of fighting the overload of central roads in analogue with other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru with reference to Moscow's deputy transport minister Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that successfully proved itself is a paid entrance.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the disadvantages and plus.
To talk about the fact that some decisions on this matter have been made, it’s too early,” Liksutov said.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which in structure and load is similar to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Lixuotov added.
The construction of the Central Ring Highway, which has recently begun, is an example of the fact that it is not necessarily all traffic to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructures, there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the deputy said.
Maxim Lyxutov also said that the introduction of paid parking has substantially dischargeed the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop on the achievement.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Fatigue is sinful
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film "The City of Sins 2: A Woman Who Wants to Kill" did not make the revolution that he could expect.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with a minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, made a revolution in the relations between cinema, comics and literary noar.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if under the thesis we understand the universe of nura, and under the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should be read: “thesis – antithesis – chaos.”
The City of Sins 2 is chaotic both at the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, here, grimla Marv (Mikki Rurk), remember, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only succeeds to catch - in the role of the etched people's girlfriend - from the air of the knife and other topors with the boots.
But the old people are literally scattered by the locks of the newbie, as if they broke into the city from another film, about the meaning and story of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, its story, unhappyly overwhelmed by the authors in the most interesting place, has the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His own is with the desirable and frightening Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something that revenge her Dwayne (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwayne, let’s say, does not distinguish from Johnny in the face – especially that the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are treated with unmotionable regularity – is not a trouble or even a halfway.
It’s not people, we understand that it’s the archaeotypes of the nura: a rocker, a too confident player, a sex detective, a corrupt pen-senator.
Well, and when the archetype valves with the archetype and the archetype pursues, it’s no longer a cinema, but observe that abstract painting.
And asking an abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is just funny.
Even in this world there is something constant.
The first "City" fighters are still holding a circular defense against the forces of darkness that occupy their hometown.
Yes and the ghost of Detective Hartigan is not, and he will look at the fireplace, and Bruce Willis is always pleasant to see.
The main problem of the “City of Sins 2” is in another.
Frank Miller was good that as a painter he talentedly combined comics and noar, and as a director he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and Noar are two aggressively opposite “realities”.
The phenomenon of the comic in modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Deshil Hammett "The Blood Sweat" (1929), "The Maltese Sweat" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a noar canon, which was then called hard-boiled school - "the crude school".
The pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozen heroes: from the seafarer Poppy, the spinner who gives him the richer power, the Superman, Batman, and the seafarer Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Tora, Spider-Man, and other “vengeants.”
But in any movie on the motives of the comics there was something harmful: the drawn characters persistently did not want to make the screenshots, they remained traits in the "real" world surrounding their will-travels.
Similarly, they were largely deprived of “existence”.
Noar, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel – with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical backgrounds – lost all confidence.
What Forsaits, what Tibo and Rugon-Macar, what even the Bolconians and Rostovans are thought after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully muted into the form of a soap opera, and the criminal novel - that is, by definition marginal - rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet on his skin learned what it was to work as a sanitary on the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, they were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such columns of the genre as the writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors Jules Dasssen, Joseph Lousey, Edward Dmitryck.
Therefore, the noar, whose archetype they set out, first is rough and cynical, and second is strictly social.
This is almost an American variant of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely by the fact that it unnaturally but organically connected the comic with the noar.
For the first time on the screen, the comics survived, not shameful of its graphic nature, and did not appear to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the world of sale, where the cardinal ordered murder and the senator covered the monstrous son of the Sadist, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details such as cut heads by which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - that is, declaratively disgraceful - representative of the neon.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a rejection, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical stylistism before the comic tradition.
Probably much of this is due to 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel stuck in a glass ball, inside which the snow is sleeping a toy clown.
However, most often it’s not snow, but blood shots, but what’s the difference?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the edge of a dirty bull, but there is a normal world where you can get back the girl who has gone on a curved road or, let’s say, tell the miserable parents that her loser is punished.
And when there is no place in the city of sin for anything except for sin, then the sin is no longer a sin but a norm.
It’s tired like any norm.
The chaos of the City of Sins 2 is just tired.
For the sake of righteousness the domestic rental gave this fresh sin a little but a pencil.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person is broken with the fingers, it gives hell humor.
Hamilton would like it.
France’s socialists must “take up and bring France in order,” says key ally François Hollande.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "to demonstrate a warm attitude" towards the attacked president-socialist, whose suspension has not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay next to him,” he said, calling applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government will not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the burning conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economics, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his Socialist Party colleagues to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of justice, put the palms in the wheels, coming to the assembly of dissent members from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "loss faith in the future."
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the extreme right National Front, expressed negligence to the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she does not imagine that the new government of Vall will last for more than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to gather a new government when the previous was not lasting and summer.
“And the new will not last in autumn or winter either,” Mrs. Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of the parliament, saying she is sure that the party can easily win in early elections and is ready to rule.
The ruling party of France was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche survey found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing into several competing factions until Mr. Hollande’s presidential term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perino, a political scientist from the University of Sians Poe, warned that the French will quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to repair the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but the public needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
“The City Without Drugs” Is Without Request
The arbitration court of Sverdlovsk left no consideration of the lawsuit of the ordering direction of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the foundation "City Without Drugs".
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles as a fee for the rental of a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the suspect did not appear to court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the lawsuit of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the Foundation "City Without Drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roysman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for the rental of the building.
Today it became known that the defendant has not appeared twice in court, which is why the decision was made to refuse the consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO directory could not explain, the chief of the legal department Maxim Titus did not respond to the phone calls.
The representatives of the fund were not contacted either.
Remember, it is a house that occupies the foundation in the center of the city on the street of Belinsky, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the ordering directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit to the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the displacement of the fund from the building.
According to the case, the department demanded through the court to recognize the unfinished contract of free use as the premises of the monument.
According to the Directorate of the MUGISO, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for the rental of the object of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov arbitration court rejected the claim, then appeal was filed to the 17th arbitration court of Permi, which was satisfied.
Then at the same court the foundation submitted a cassation complaint on this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation at the Higher Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new rental agreement was signed, according to which the fund again began to pay the rental fee, the city's head Yevgeny Roysman told.
The rental fee was assigned 300 thousand rubles per month.
The previous administration of the area gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.

Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was proposed to leave voluntarily
On July 24, a deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosincev, proposed to the mayor of the city, the speaker of pride, Yevgeny Roysman, to resign.
The cause served as a criminal case against the arrested suspect of murder of a pensioner deputy of pride Oleg Kinev, who is considered a co-author of the mayor.
How Eugene Roismann was found criminal case
On 1 July it became known about the initiation of a criminal proceedings on the fact of "clavets" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roismann.
This was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova addressed with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roismann accused her in her blog posts of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to revenge for the truth."
The iPhone becomes a wallet.
In the eve of September 9, when Apple is scheduled to present its new developments, new leaks about what can be expected from the presentation appear in the press.
U.S. media reports that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized internet resource Re/code, on the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may among other things announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available with the mobile wallet feature.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this.
This feature allows you to make a payment on the store’s cash with a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID feature.
It is that the iPhone will first be integrated with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which allows you to make non-contact payments using a smartphone and the corresponding reader on the cash.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC feature was introduced in 2004 in collaboration with Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum – the association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC feature, Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about the innovation and don’t too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, the observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their stores.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on the supply of Mistral to Russia does not change
French Foreign Affairs spokesman Roman Nadal has stated that Paris is unchanged with regard to the supply of the Mistral-type helicopter carriers to Russia.
“I can remind the statement of the President of the Republic (François Hollande), made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not of France," said Mr. Nadal at RIA Novosti.
So a representative of the French Foreign Policy Department replied to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change of the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.
More details about the delivery of helicopter carriers to Russia read in the material of the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" almost ours.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations on the acquisition of the similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to reports of people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise vessels and Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with bigger competitors Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement may be announced this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations may still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise’s shares.
The sources asked to remain unknown as negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request to comment, while Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue amounted to $2,57 billion in 2013, 13 percent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She said her income was $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
It is expected that the $29 billion cruise industry will be beneficial in the following years for middle-class growth in developing economies such as China and India.
Crossing companies are looking to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the U.S. regulatory authorities for the primary public distribution of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company’s main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in the way it exists now, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment and casino conglomerate that was under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Cock Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 percent, Apollo owned a share of 20 percent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 percent in the company, according to the end of June, according to the report.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists break the Chinese representative's speech the next day after the election decision
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood nearby, scattering Chinese flags.
The Permanent Committee of the All-Chinese People's Assembly on Sunday determined the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the Hong Kong leader elections in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the committee members, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the Democratic opposition to get into the electoral bill and forced the Democratic movement activists to again promise to stop the Hong Kong financial center by the Occupy Central protests.
The political reform is the main source of tensions in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong, in June, the Democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went out to the city's business center and organized a sitting strike.
The briefing is organized by the government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Relations Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the All-Chinese Assembly of People's Representatives, Zhang Rongshun, and Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau State Council, Feng Wei, were also to speak on a series of briefings during the day.
Students activists said they will gather at the head of government building in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
The UK has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to join 400 hectares of land on the western shore of the Jordan River, which belongs to the Palestinian autonomy.
According to the BBC, the decision to join the land by Southern Bethlehem is linked with the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced on Sunday that the territory was occupied and ordered the military to establish an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to a spokesman for the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, the world’s public should call on Israel to respond for “continuing settlement activity on the west coast of Jordan and in Eastern Jerusalem.”
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the “state” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battles with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state" of the separated region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not intend to suggest that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needs to be revised in order to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal was in line with the obvious strategy he followed since the beginning of the bloody five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorussia the actual independence to get closer to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the state First Channel of television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories by Novorussia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in detained by separatists regions, is "the prisoner of illusions," it said.
“We must immediately begin content negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed over months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin’s press spokesman to correct the “fake interpretation” of Putin’s words emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in a different way than the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys before the conflict began showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy by itself, in essence, by transferring to the Kremlin the actual control of the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with the Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, joined five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine facilities and historic marine resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea there are also mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7, that Ukrainian legislatives after the new elections to lift amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view on autonomy seems to be very different from the view of the Kremlin and separatist rebels whose weapons and incitement accuse Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as with equals, followed the new attacks of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russia-backed separatists took over the city of Novozovsk in an attack, which Ukrainian security officials say they are afraid it is the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the same Crimea.
This led to large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a stainless port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novozovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the EU leaders’ meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of unreturn,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the draft of stricter sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilowaisk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the troubled separatists, Colonel Andri Lysenko, the press spokesman of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which, according to the existing information, are held in Ilowaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian aircraft passengers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his hatred to the hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride Gabi Greco and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is disappointed after a series of genuine photos on which naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for it has about 60 honest photos of the Star of the Hunger Games Lawrence and the superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevine, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michelle and actress Kirsten Dust.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivan Strakhovsky and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of a flight from iCloud.
101 names of celebrities.
Edelstein, who made Greco's offer last month, said Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private letters and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information may be stolen and dispatched to others.
The Greco, who is in New York, said to the news site that the hacking attack was “pastorious” and that those to whom it was targeted “seem they had invaded them.”
The hacker is supposed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his former boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two pictures where she lies next to a swimming pool with a naked breast.
The works of Palmer in the movie include "Love and Honor" together with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chack" Strakhovsky and the actress from "The Forbidden Reception" Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence said TMZ: "This is a sharp invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his anger to the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Plating photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually nothing different from selling stolen goods."
Simply from a legal point of view, you cannot tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
A mass hack of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario of developing events was described by the source The Next Web.
On the Github source was published a script in Python, which allowed you to select passwords to Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same login and password link is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities have been stolen.
The script enabled the search method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all kinds of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that the number of passwords that can be entered in the Find My Phone service is unlimited.
When the security system is properly organized after several failure attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and notified to the user of the attempt to hack.
Due to vulnerability, users have not received any messages about trying to pick up a password to their account.
Hackers discovered the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a message by Hackapp on Twitter, the vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written a script program to select passwords.
At the moment the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the Star account.
It’s not me, plz RT
The Prime Minister’s Twitter record has again appeared.
Although there is no solid evidence that the vulnerability in Find My Phone has been used to steal photos, there has already been a wave of malicious actions using this service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case, Apple told the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the tweet of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also previously broken.
If the criminals gained access to iCloud in the way described above, then there could also be a password to the head of government’s account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to get an Apple comment on the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

Anger is the most universal and functional emotion of man.
Heartful expression of the face is biologically universal for mankind, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not random, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, Australian and U.S. scientists have discovered.
Their discoveries have been revealed in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face is the moving and down-to-down frogs, stretched to a thin line of lips, swallowed nodes - the same in all cultures, and it is made even blind since birth by children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a large research project dedicated to the nature of anger, the scientists found that this emotion arose for effective dispute management during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the possibility to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers have found confirmations and another of their hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and move to handhappiness, consider themselves entitled to impose others unsuitable conditions for them, and also prefer force methods to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Depending on the fact that anger is first and foremost the “emotion of the tour”, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus force him to agree with his conditions as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on the computer the person where each of the seven elements of the angry person was or was absent, and showed them to the informant.
Though the leaked bridges or advanced submarines separately did not make the face evil, the physically stronger person depicted with such traits was recognized by the study participants unanimously.
The anger of man, like in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own strength, forcing him to agree and obey.
A man swallowes the nails and presses his lips for the same purpose as the swallowing butter or the grandmother who shows his clusters.
The anger begins with the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, most effectively demonstrating the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most surprising thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said Anthropologist John Tubi.
