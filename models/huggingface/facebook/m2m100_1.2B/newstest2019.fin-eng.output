Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane home victory at the opening - second victory for Savo Volley
Hurricane-Loimaa, who has won medals in the Champions League for men’s volleyball seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, when Raision Loimu crashed on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective player in the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some stimuli for abroad, but they did not come true, and then there was a call from Loima.
It was done very quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kook, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimussa, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective among the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, who played on a match-specific contract with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the opposite side, which added extra to the game.
Our game is not yet finished, but the goal of the medal tube is, of course, to continue, Kouki said.
The Most Effective Volley
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective with 18 points, when the team defeated the Vanda Ducks 3-0.
The game was very difficult, especially in the offensive, but fortunately we managed to win.
At least I didn’t have any consciously different loads when I played against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Lentopallo 3 in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
The head coach was pleased with many things.
The room was small and the atmosphere was on the roof.
A good man left home.
Miro was a kink, Sillin also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielaveden Sammossa while Tuovinen was the head coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mickey is the star again.
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, who won the point exchange in the league, has also started this season strongly.
Hakuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the opening victory of the season after hitting Kokkolan Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
Today we were close to defeat because we were in the fourth half with a loss of 17-21.
There was a batch win, and the fifth batch came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tiger’s most effective player in the final was Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Alexander Kudrjashov supported with 17 points.
I didn’t get a bit of a touch on the guy’s hack, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranked number one in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is the world’s leader in human capital comparison, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan appeared on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked worst.
When measuring human capital, the population’s level of education, access to education, skills and health are considered.
According to the World Bank, human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid’s Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in control, the local match ended without a goal
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into the glorious leagues, and the local Madrid team match ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atlético Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian keeper Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played three games at Atletico while he was a Chelsea player.
The International Football Federation (FIFA) has named him the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real Madrid, Gareth Bale scored the best place, but his shot went past the goal at the end of the opening half.
Bale left after the break for a change.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real Madrid supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus during the match.
In the United States, abortion law is now under attack - a powerful document shows why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote can overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States in 1973.
The documentary by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights, shows how the current situation has come about over the years.
As unbelievable as it may seem, the topic is also relevant in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has made public work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of our country’s parliamentarians.
In the beginning of the powerful documentary, we encounter gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor in Missouri to perform abortions due to law enforcement.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending religious freedom in the United States.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
It was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Congregation of Churchmen guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died for an abortion made by herself is enough.
There were deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
Abortion was legalized by the Republican Party.
In 1967, California’s abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, who began to confuse religion with politics in a turning-down manner in order to slander voters.
His successor, George Bush the Elder.
Donald Trump did the same.
The documentary reaches the core of the matter in the search for the underlying cause for the politization of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations advocating racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes into politics.
In writing this, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who boasted of sexual harassment but captured the voices of the religious right with his abortion support, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused by many women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh will be given the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli Army Shoots Seven Palestinians, Among Them Two Children
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in the past six months as Israel fires at protesters in the border zone.
Israeli troops shot seven Palestinians at the Gaza border on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, among the dead are two children, 12 and 14 years old.
The ministry said 505 people were injured.
Of those, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike at the border zone as protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it has begun to use force to prevent protesters from breaking the border fence or seeking the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations on the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 people injured.
Demonstrators are demanding access for Palestinian families to the areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped from the Palestinian side with leaves and helium balls have set fire to forests and farmland in Israel.
He received a penalty shot and could not shoot himself.
Wigan's topman Chey Dunkley seemed to have struck him down in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to her interpretation, it was clean.
The boy couldn’t believe his eyes.
The situation seemed to be bothered by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty stroke, and Mario Vrancic shaken the 1-0 win.
Norwich scored five goals in the championship.
Last Saturday, he was born against QPR with a stylish chest muscle.
The food tasted good again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended tirelessly.
It was the fifth match for Norwich in two weeks.
The team continues in the league.
There is a five winning line.
Pedophile assistance service filled immediately with reservations - about 40,000 are interested in children in Finland
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in the preschool age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Children or young people who are sexually interested have so far had difficulty getting help.
A joint SeriE project between the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals in meeting pedophiles as clients, as well as helping people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood began at Sexpo, which offers counseling and therapy, and meetings were booked very quickly, Yle says.
They are promised to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame to many.
Most of those who are self-aware of pedophile feelings have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus have not committed anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of those thoughts that harass and depress them.
They also make it difficult to live a normal life, says Patricia Thesleff, a sex therapist who works as a special expert on the project.
I think work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the Nobel Peace Prize winner – the idea may sound suddenly strange, but according to the betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favorites to be the winner of the award.
The backdrop is Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the speech level.
The biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are, according to the odds, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace deal between their countries.
The warming between the Koreas is remarkable, since even last year, the warming between the Koreas was yellow.
Nevertheless, the reward for Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and led by a iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prize will be announced on Monday, and the Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday.
If the prize is not awarded to those who participated in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congo physician Denis Mukwege.
The renowned gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has grown into a leading expert in his field in the world.
In his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a karmic by-product of many conflicts.
The United Nations Refugee Organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
According to the Nobel Committee, there are 331 nominations for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump would not be surprised if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved the Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are facts that make Trump’s Nobel probability unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multi-faceted world order – just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent to.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians who have all been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s reward would require a full ideological transition from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alert in tunnel: Drivers behaved like trolls and drove in the wrong direction
The accident occurred on the first road on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the notification both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to normalize traffic.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it could not be opened because there are drivers on the road in a shock and they drive how it hurts, journalist firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told the STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway went in the wrong direction even after waiting for a moment.
When the first one begins to act against the traffic rules, a few others are often followed by, Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety’s contact manager, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, stops on highways and tunnels are not permitted except for compelling reasons.
Traffic Safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances it is not possible to put traffic at risk with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to pass as unobstructed as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the highway is especially prohibited, as is making a u-turn and reversing.
The same prohibition also applies in tunnels, where the lights must always be turned on.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen says in a press release.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue to celebrate even though the ship was stuck at the bottom of the lake
The fans of Ilves, which were transported to Tampere by the M/S inland water ship, would have wanted to stay on board the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught in the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who served as the ship’s captain at the time of the incident.
The M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinn to Tampere, drove off the route late on Saturday night and was caught by its bow at the bottom of the Vanajavoda in Aka.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland.
No one was injured in the hunt.
The fans of Ilves would have liked to continue to celebrate on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them to the fire department to the harbour and the bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna watching the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with Ilves’ 4-3 victory.
According to the police, the accident occurred on Saturday because the surface of the water at Vanajavoda was about half a meter lower than normal.
The navigation was also complicated by the fact that the nearest lane sign was covered with logging wreckage, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark bridge.
No more accusations
The accident occurred on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after a shipyard had crossed the highway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
No greater dramatism was associated with the incident, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the ground did not cause a more notable collision.
According to the district, trapping to the bottom has not caused the ship to leak or pressure, and on these views, the ship's cruises will continue normally.
The submarine went on Saturday morning to check the condition of the vessel before the vessel began to be removed from the low boat.
For the sake of security, we will continue to check at the shipyard to ensure that no damage has been caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, scheduled for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alert on Saturday night, just after half a.m.
In the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and a rather strong wind.
The Pirkanmaan rescue agency informed at half three in the night against Sunday that all those on board have been evacuated and the passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser was renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump Judge Candidate Accused of Drinking and Bullying May Be Missing Top Position
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as Supreme Court judge, may well be missing the position he sought, said program director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior while studying.
Aaltola said the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up nominating someone else for office.
In the United States, the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has occasionally caused a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate is usually himself withdrawn, says Aaltola.
That way, the president has been able to preserve his face.
Nomination to the Democratic Party
The U.S. Supreme Court tends to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh’s case, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely fall to the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional midterm elections.
It would increase voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
In the United States, the Supreme Court judges are appointed on a lifetime basis.
In practice, some of them have given up on their own request for retirement at around 70-80 years of age.
Republicans are in doubt.
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally undertaken background investigation, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only given the FBI a week’s time limit for further investigation, it can still bring something important to light, according to Aaltola.
It may bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for the post will still be debated lively before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 in the Senate, but at least two Republican senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman told the BBC that she identified the Russian suspect in the Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman said it was Anatoli Tshepiga, a military intelligence officer at the GRU.
Bellingcat and Insider Russia have revealed that one of the men suspected of poisoning is Chepiga.
Previously, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities are hidden identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified the young Tshepigan from pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from pictures of British police in which he appeared as Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded the Honorary Mark of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia has denied any suspected GRU links.
In an interview with Russian television in September, the two men said they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly in the Reformation
Now we have a vivid example of what the reform restrictor defined by the Sipilän government means in practice.
Vaala health services are provided by the county of Oulunkaare, whose health service director is the former regional director of Attendo, who was elected in 2016.
The board of directors warned the board of directors of the change.
If sote spending increases now, state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the elderly care system, which would end the institutional care of the bed department of the health center and the small unit for memory sick.
Home care would be increased, which means that the elderly living in remote villages in Vaala for long distances will be removed from their roots to the health center to be treated "at home".
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay the customers for it.
The Vaala Left did not absorb the poor preparation, but organized a good public event, to which many relatives, close caregivers and also other parties’ delegates attended.
I presented in the dios of the provincial preparation for health and welfare, how the municipality of Vaala currently cares for the elderly at home most in the entire Northern Region.
There was also the representative of the neighborhood, Carina Wäntinen.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the occasion, and it again brought the preparers of Oulunkaare to their backs.
Sote preparers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which now awaits empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The preparers only talk about the service ticket, but do not say what level of care it receives or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will take care of the elderly up to parental care.
Without a nurse?
The health care facilities are closed because there is no doctor’s daycare.
Attendo will also resort to the doctors of Vaala Health Center.
Vaala’s example shows how central officials roam authorized officers with incomplete information and authorized officers are injected with their back against the wall with a change restrictor.
In this way, the central party will empty Vaala’s inhabitants, because who will stay there unsecured to live voluntarily if there is a possibility to move away.
Was it one electoral clause in the centre that the whole country was considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Hundreds of people have gathered on the shore since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the banners of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit, which began on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been strict.
Around 10,000 people were expected to go to the streets in Cologne to protest the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan’s supporters also gathered near the mosque.
Police isolated a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his successful visit to Germany and said it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are profound differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet canceled their attendance at the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came from Switzerland to a protest against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They were arrested, killed and subdued.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the last phase of Erdogan’s trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant portion of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three accused in Slovakia for murder of journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in his home in Bratislava in February.
He had investigated the ties between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect the murders are related to Kuciak’s investigations.
The case and Kuciak’s article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with livestock distribution on Sunday in scattered areas
Due to the error of the printing, the Sunday Carriers will also have to be postponed as unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in scattered settlements, where distribution to common boxes must be carried out from the outer memory.
The situation was the same for the newspaper on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra bullets in the countryside.
Newspapers from other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is delayed considerably.
A Finnish astronaut.
Journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heila today in a live discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price of the loan amounted to 151,000 euros, which was paid by a bank loan.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been delayed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate flight, which occurred in 2014 and claimed deaths, things are going well.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or later next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that the flight takes place about a year from the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and in weightless mode you will be 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same time, he also wants to go into space.
As a child, I read the Star Trek series and watched the Star Trek series on television.
Star Wars has been seen, and that’s what I thought.
Why not ?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City is a great host.
Manchester City continued unbeaten in the Premier League when it defeated Brighton 2–0 on their home field on Saturday.
The sixth victory of the dominant championship season will be guaranteed by goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season from close to empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at the 30th minute at the back of Brighton’s goal.
Agüero raised his own margin to five when he and Sterling cut the Brighton defense into pieces at the 65th minute.
The Argentine man managed to finish 2-0 in the penalty line.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with 19 points.
Liverpool, with one game less, is only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth chooses new leaders in Rio de Janeiro
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Club selected the new decision-makers for its next three-year term 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Hämey was elected deputy chairman.
A total of 40 full members and 40 deputy members were elected, the Finnish Youth Club on Sunday.
The youth conference was held in Riverside.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational objectives, the Youth Conference held in Joensuu gives three promises: We will keep the doors open to all, and we will organize equal hobby activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Association says in its statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrari: "Lossing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue with the team next season and at the same time, Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn’t believe that Räikkönen hit the gloves in the dish.
"I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It makes no sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 games on PlayStation all day.
“I’ve always been Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will take place on Sunday in Russia.
The race starts at 4 p.m. with Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.

The championship of the A-Youth SM Series became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players.
The top level of football for boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season will be played.
Before the round, which began at 13 a.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy will be able to score one point in practice against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship, must defeat PK-35 and wish the Gulfers a defeat.
However, the Lahti championship was practically assured before the start bet, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one fewer, the game could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the end of the match, the Lakers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vasa is that the team has played in parts with the same players in the A-young SM-series, i.e. P20-series and the Men's Kakkosen C-block.
Vasa IFK has played in 2nd place practically against the fall of the whole season.
In the final round of the two on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to beat JBK in a guest match and at the same time hopes that Tampere United will lose their own guest match against KuFua in Toila in Siilinjärvi.

There was good luck, the report said.
Rescuers said the road was wet after the rain.
Police officers came to the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means for intelligence: equipment procurement and recruitment have already been completed, the activities planned for abroad are not slashed
According to Supo chief Antti Pelttari, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
With the Intelligence Laws coming into force, the budget would be permanently increased by about ten million euros.
The premises of the Protection Police (SUP) located on the Helsinki Railroad are already fully preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Laws.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo’s assembly background, tells Lännen Media that equipment procurements have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams shocks with video where she sings in the upper chest - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
Tennis star Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness about breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account where she sings with her hands just in front of her breasts.
The song is the 1991 hit of the Australian band The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
With this video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I sounded the worldwide hit of The Divinyls to remind women to do regular self-checks,” Williams wrote in his Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in the zone of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women regardless of their skin color anywhere in the world.
Early detection is all a and o – it scares many lives.
The Divinyls song's second author is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, created in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams was removed from the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
It was held at the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams shot the main judge of the match, arguing, among other things, that the behavior of men is accepted to be much more violent than that of female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for high-speed people
In addition to traditional Chinese dishes, the restaurant also serves beautiful landscapes.
China's Zhejiang province has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally located on a rock tongue.
If you want, you can see the forest.
The cool landscapes at the heights make restaurant visitors sneak their breath in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant requires a hike in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to tourists on 19 September 2018.
You can see on YouTube where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
Going to the restaurant requires a good ground condition, it is said from the place.
This is the end of the day: this is how it all ends.
Every good thing ends at some time.
Today, it is a local country drama that has been quite celebrated.
The third season has gone like hot stones: last week 722 000 Finns watched the episode on television as a premiere.
The top numbers have no practical significance anymore, as the series of Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkinen has no continuation.
In the final, the relationship between Jaskan and Mirkun is taking a sharp leap forward again, and Jaskan’s mother is probably the first to guess what will come.
The relationship between Anss and Miisa is also warm, in the light of recent events, quite romantic, but then Laiho once again appears in the patterns.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one can predict the fate in advance.
Anita gets incredible news.
A long-distance will is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
Within a week, Sunday evening will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjon.
The show is on TV1 today at 21:55.
Are you going to work tomorrow with a cold?
Facts for and against
The cold season is hot.
Lots of people stay home or not.
However, it is worthwhile to think about whether it is worthwhile to go to others to infect, because the disease can be contagious even if its own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the cold hit suddenly, sometimes they appear as a slide.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying at home?
Influenza is contagious even when the person does not have any symptoms.
The virus is infected a day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children can get the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or work.
You can go back to work when the cough is gone and the fever is no longer there, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too quickly slows the recovery.
Remember to wash your hands, soak your toenails and throw the paper into the rubbish.
A painful move?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
In this case, the fingers should not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also, itching is limited to a mask.
How can infections be avoided?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats mischief tradition: “My husband is a hockey player”
Ice hockey and misses are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkovan, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland Crown has been awarded to Alina Voronkova.
She now lives in Lahore, where she moved when she was 15 years old.
Alina’s mother is Finnish and her father is Russian.
For his father's Russianship, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mom and dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was harassed because of my Russian identity.
I didn’t have any friends in Pertunmaa,” Alina said at the announcement ceremony of the Miss Finland semi-finalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon after, she found new friends and went out hopefully.
When I was 15 years old, I thought I was an adult, but then I didn’t think about it.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is known from the ranks of the Pelicans.
After the SM league career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
At the beginning of the relationship, the couple lived almost a year apart, but later Alina traveled to the world with her husband.
If I could get into the winning triangle and thus boost my career, I don’t want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we were to live separately, our confidence works well and the good side of a distance relationship is that the initial pain will stay on all the time, Alina cried out in May.
With continuous growth in joy, death on our knees
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
But almost nothing wants to be given up.
Sustainable alternatives to sustainable growth are being sought, but even the fair economy theory is facing major problems.
For several generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-lasting overcapacity of the planet and climate change are threatening to shake this stonefoot of the market economy.
Two men were killed on Sunday night at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in a knife stroke and another, born in 1968, was slightly injured.
The elderly have already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible involvement is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted murder and serious abuse.
IFK Mariehamn: Inter coach regrets mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's defeat against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match with a score of 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right side and luckyly lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the guest-to-guest match, the Maarianhaminans tightened the difference to two points in the Turun Palloseura, which is at the seat of the series.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Maarianhama’s head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted, however, that the team did not engage in the battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening season, but fortunately the goal of the Turks brought us stronger into the game.
Home team Inter coach John Allen said the game was in control, but the goal again caused pain.
One defensive mistake took us a full point, Allen regretted.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland ranks first in 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the population.
Finland is the best country in the world if it is measured by human capital.
Finland was ranked number one in a survey that measured citizens’ health and education and learning.
The survey measured capital change from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
In summary, human capital has a significant influence on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The worst situation is in Africa.
The countries of the continent took the seven worst places in the comparison.
It is Niger.
This was first stated by STT.
The player showed his underpower, the playground is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä’s strong underpower appeared when his NHL team Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1 and Lehter pushed Michael Raffl twice into the scoring.
In recent years, he has been arrested due to drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug deals, some of which are suspected of drug use and some of which are suspected of selling drugs.
The newspaper has denied committing a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Sam Carchidi, who closely follows the flyers, estimated after the match that Lehter belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a place in the NHL team.
During the training, Carpenter was excellent.
In the second half, Lehterä fought the disk for himself with underpower, pulled the defender into his attack and drove Raffli, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open spot.
For the second time, the two team made a draw at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a visiting match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen awaits the decision of the team’s training management whether he will join the NHL group.
I think the training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of it.
The coach will decide if I can play.
I think I’m ready for the NHL,” he said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.
He played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
He surrendered four times and rejected twenty times.
Vili Saarijärvi, a flies-backed defender, scored Detroit a 1-0 overpower when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In the ranks of Calgary, Ilves grew, defender Juuso Välimäki got an input point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers beat Jesse Puljujärve and goalkeeper Mikko Kosk.
Florida’s Alexander Barkov played 20 minutes and scored a goal in the local match against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won by 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara gave his team a comforting goal in the middle of the final, when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the losing goals, Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 records.
Approximately 180,000 respondents
Citizens have actively responded to the survey concerning the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time has already gathered more than 180,000 answers.
The answer to the questionnaire opened on Otakantaa.fi will be answered in less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be at the same time as other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
The most powerful man in the world lost tens of kilos.
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world’s strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British man Eddie Hall has long and determinedly pursued the title of the world’s strongest man.
Hall could have eaten up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed 200 kilograms at his height, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirt is 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he had done damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British chased for the world’s strongest man race with every means and the family man promised to end his career if he won the title.
Hall did not want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen in the April 2018 World’s Strongest Man competition.
Recently Hall posted a photo on Instagram where he poses in a much slimmer shape in his active career.
Hall says his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he now trains five times a week aerobically.
The program includes, among other things, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the world’s strongest man was named by the Icelandic Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson from Game of Thrones.
The final winner was Janne Virtanen, who finished first in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed in Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly caught in a stone"
The inland water ship M/S Tampere crashed late on Friday night on the Akaha in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue service was alerted for a water accident on Friday after midnight.
The 30-meter ship M/S Tampere has rushed to a cradle, and is firmly attached to its arch with a stone, described journalist firefighter Matti Willman.
On board were 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue agency, injuries were avoided.
The passengers and almost all crew members were evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, the journalist Jari Nieminen told STT after 1 a.m. at night.
In the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, a ship travelling from Hämeenlinn to Tampere had dropped off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalme.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather strong wind.
The rescue agency said the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship does not float.
After the evacuation operation, the submarines will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant vessel with a maximum allowable passenger capacity of 180 people.
There is also a conference room for private use on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser was renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid remuneration from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teper is shaded by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today about an appeal filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkilan, in which unpaid manager fees for a total of over 80,000 euros are collected from Helenius with delay interest.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other option.
This has been a clear mandate, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehd, telling about the events the boxer's view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the requested amount.
According to Vastinen, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsorship revenues for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay premiums only as a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on wage work and it would have been absurd in the case of Helenius, Sundman explains in a message.
There was never a written agreement.
According to Vastine, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman were not able to get the draft done until the end of 2014.
He declared that the proposal was unfair for himself and broke the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not ever have a relationship with Kokkilu and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was assigned a “unidentified but substantial” deduction from the manager’s job.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkilu’s subsequent activities to be petty, it is stated in return.
Helenius today meets Erkan Teper, who is seventh in the IBF heavy series challenge list in Stuttgart.
A good man and a good journalist.
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio conductor and journalist Erkki Pällin for decades.
Long-line radio conductor and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The death notice was published on Sunday in Helsinki Sanom.
It is that Pellin died on 3 September.
Pälli his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, Ile Vainio also saw the publication, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He said goodbye on Facebook, as he said.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers Pällin was a respected man who had quick hooks and funny things.
I got to know Erk as a young boy when I first visited Finnley at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouser.
We met with Erik.
He was then Finnley's informant and in various duties, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the standard editor at all the parties making stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how great a focus he had on entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he went straight into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a good man and a good journalist.
He was known to many as a prestigious radio speaker, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.
Erik interviewed me several times.
He was good at speaking and praised.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to journalism at Fazer with Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, Pälly’s biggest passion was radio work, in which he had a distinctive style.
He has been working on radio since the 1960s, and became familiar to numerous listeners in the Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association said on Saturday that the accounting period ended in May showed a profit of approximately 450,000 euros.
The Federation describes its economic situation as experiencing a "complete transition", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict economic discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn by taking adaptation measures as quickly as possible.
The careful planning of the activities and the management of the finances has been embedded throughout our organization, Kulmala says in the statement.
We have also achieved great success in the acquisition of partners, and in addition, the earnings of the World Cups were maximum in the previous competition season.
However, in the future, the management of costs must also be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where wounded survivors have been gathered to assess injury and need for care.
Patients are also treated outside due to post-trauma.
One of them was a 52-year-old refugee, Baharuddin, who was searching for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
I last spoke with him when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the Army Hospital in Palua, Dwi Haris was injured in his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I was probably stuck under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
“I hope they are safe,” Haris told the AP news agency, according to British media.
Small shops are robbed.
At the return evacuation center, the 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her baby from the fever.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many inhabitants of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was somehow standing, any after-tremors could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants alone.
According to the AP news agency, more than half of the prisoners fled after the prison walls collapsed.
There were approximately 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were furious and set fire to the prison after the guards forbade them from leaving to search for their relatives who were affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for rescue flights.
Among the first, the Army's C-130 transport aircraft landed on the ground, bringing aid supplies.
Commercial flights to the airport are only permitted in a limited amount.
The pilots were forced to land on the airfield without the help of a controller because the control tower was severely damaged by an earthquake.
Rain flows over Finland at night
A long rainfall will spread across the country on Sunday night from the west, the meteorological department said.
The rain will mostly come in the middle, but in the central and northern Lapland it is expected to rain or snow.
The last night’s frost will not be repeated, as the temperatures will remain higher under cloud cover.
A cloudy night keeps lower temperatures under control quite effectively.
Just in the west, you can visit the frosty side for a moment, said Ville Ilkka, a meteorologist.
On Sunday, the rainfall will retreat to the east in the morning.
In the south and west is cloudy or half cloudy.
In the afternoon, the temperatures will always move up to the altitude of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more volatile.
Wind and wave warnings are in place.
Autumn storms are not expected in the coming days, but otherwise, typical autumn weather variation is expected.
I think the summer is going to start getting serious, he said.
The final will not be seen on TV.
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and glamour of the red carpet of the Miss Finland contest.
Iltalehti entertainment reporters are drawing on IL-TV a live broadcast from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs pot.
The broadcast starts around 18.50.
The finalist will be crowned on Saturday among the 10 finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held in the Billnäs pot in Raasepor.
Before the final, you will be able to follow the atmosphere on-site on IL-TV’s live broadcast.
The live broadcast will start at around 6:30 p.m. and will continue for about an hour.
This year, a lot of winners of the previous years have been invited to the final.
In the jury they were represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other members of the jury include entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jounin Kaupan CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped he would go to college before he left for Mississippi.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter’s first moments on the crown.
They drove to the public from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
A wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result it started to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Anchor and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks Russian fluently, even though she has lived in Finland throughout her childhood.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss’s career.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty she should start to be a miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
Later, she became interested in beauty competitions.
Their parents wanted Alina to go to college before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
So it happened, and eventually Alina wanted to do a master’s degree before the Mississippi Games.
We asked him last year why he didn’t participate, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people as well as adults.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it’s seen.
Alina’s boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is working in hockey in Japan and has not been able to go to Finland to encourage his lover in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the younger couple’s relationship will last a mission year.
That is intended!
My parents wanted my daughter to come soon.
There has been a long break in the visit because of the missions.
I miss it, even though there are messages.
A young man died in an overrun in Lahti - police arrested three people
Police say three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
On Saturday, the police did not comment on the course of the events or the possible intention of the excess, citing the unfinished investigation.

More information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a cartoon came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic puppy started from my husband’s statement, in which he proposed it as a story that I developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, an Esbo comic book blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator in Brussels who worked on economic and legal affairs until after having a fourth child, the family became a return migrant ten years ago.
I enjoy being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I came to think of what I would do when the little one was already growing up.
In 2014 there was a picture.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Anka, Tintin and Asterix as a child.
I was last drawing as a child, but when these Biomuhompa manuscripts began to appear, the situation changed.
In the beginning, I made a few dozen manuscripts on the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn’t get her attracted until in the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with a drawing plate.
His enthusiasm took about a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says the drawing plate was a great incentive for him.
A drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practices at night.
I’m constantly thinking about the script, but I don’t usually finish it all at once.
One of the three stripes takes up to several hours.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest genre.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the current series of newspapers, including Dilbert by Scott Adams.
As individuals of the organic hump, a mother with a carrot body with a salad hair pot has been thrilled by the L theme.
The other characters are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
Ideas for the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a compulsory bowl even though the Organic Bowl sometimes intrudes.
Piippo says she reads her series to her husband and children.
It’s such a wonderful feeling when you look at the cartoon you have drawn and say that this is what I’ve done today.
There are challenges for the mother.
The series can be read online at the address organic mouthpiece.com

Earthquake in Indonesia: Flight manager sacrificed himself – did not leave a cracking tower until he saved hundreds of passengers
Indonesian aviation chief Anthonius Gunawan Agung was named the hero of the earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the flight control tower until a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people was safely taken off the earthquake-shaken island.
The young man was in flight control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck Friday.
As others escaped from the flight control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being guided from the runway of the Batik Air passenger plane.
This could have saved hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration said.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the quake.
The control tower trembled and broke.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was taken to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake intensified after the flight, and was eventually measured at magnitude 7.5.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has honored Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn thinks of the end of Europe in a trade war: "We have to look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been lowered across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
CEO Olli Rehn said that although the tightening of tensions has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in corporate investment decisions.
This also applies to Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is well-suited so far.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
The European Union does not seem to have a trade war on its feet.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unexpected partner in Washington, he said in an interview.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Markets yesterday reacted sharply on Thursday evening by the Italian government to present a clearly deficit budget.
Next year, the deficit will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
5% of the country’s borrowing stock is problem loans and over 10% are unsecured loans.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country seems to once again exceed its commitments to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another problem is the UK’s departure from the European Union.
Rehn hoped it would go well.
A divorce would have far more negative consequences.
Rehn was appointed President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in a year.
The discussion with his followers has begun.
Both the name of Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen has been flattered in speeches.
It does not matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he will not comment further on the matter.
HS's super-popular Black Box shows continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are in sale
The popular Black Box shows organized by the Helsinki Sanoma will continue again this week.
The other performances will be seen in the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still a few tickets for the National Theatre.
The Tokyo show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Ticket.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long-prepared true story that has not been published in any HS media before.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
“There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe, and a narrating story on a very current health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of The Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsinki Sanomat has been organizing live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited.
The Black Box was awarded the Bonnier Award for Journalism of the Year.
The award winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the journalist’s desire to get close to their readers.
The Black Box of the Spring 2019 season will be shown at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also be visited in Tampere and Turku.
The show at that time has a different content than this autumn evening.
Missing Fungalor Found Thanks to 'Unprecedented Experiment'
Finnish police’s drone expertise is top in the world: “We are being asked about training”
According to the rector of the police university, the police can use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in the investigation of the crime scene and in intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find the missing fungus in Raah with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the rector of the police university, tweeted about the case, citing, among other things, that “through unprecedented experimentation and effective education, we are the world’s leader here too.”
Drone is a relatively new capture and even more recent in police tasks.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police are the masters in the use of drones.
According to himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been cleared, for example, when Finnish police’s experiences have been in international events.
There is a great deal of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to see the Finnish police’s drone activity.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly exalted
He added that it is very important to find the disappeared in the winter conditions of Finland as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahen, the missing man was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
He said he wants to get more training.
Drones are already widely used in police tasks, and their use will be widespread and increased in the future.
That’s what I’d say, says Himberg.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in the investigation of accidents or crimes and in certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, you have to check out some area a little further away, where there may be a fear that there will be violence.
Drones can be used for preliminary surveillance.
Karjalan Rugby Rises to 1st Division
Karjalan Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopi on Saturday.
Joensuans were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and knocked the southern guests 26-12.
The 2nd Division championship also marked the historic rise of Karjalan Rugby to the 1st Division.
In the past, the club has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is planning to take over the series, but it knows a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players has to be increased to 25.
Division 1 is also aware of the increase in the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with it.
Liverpool starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien confirmed on Twitter that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super-promising Aries, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer booking.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training force from the end of the summer and has shown strong touches in September’s training matches.
The Eagle managed to make a painting right in its first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps in development after arriving in the camp.
The NHL starts next week on Thursday night.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk this week about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nokia, told HS in an interview about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he highlights his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia investigations have also talked about the leaders’ inability to act as a team; the fear and non-talk that partly caused the mobile phone business to collapse.
The company’s risk-taking and agility disappeared.
This week in Helsinki was also held a giant business event Nordic Business Forum, which drew the cream of the Finnish business community to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, there are 12 stars in the world of business.
Talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel once said that a good leader should dare to lead a company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a global organic food chain, said that managers need to be able to communicate the purpose of the company to the entire staff.
This cannot be merely a profit for the owner.
Susan Cain, author of the book, said that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
They are often introverted.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, recalled that the qualities of a good leader must match the lifecycle phase of a company.
At the beginning of a company, the manager must be able to tell a story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows numbers.
These lessons were heard at the Nordic Business Forum by 7,500 visitors – mostly Finnish executives.
They were in danger of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
This is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Silasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other on the sidelines.
However, it is unlikely that they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easily judged by the outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on a stunning red carpet right from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the final in a beautiful black dress.
In the 2012 Miss Finland dress, there was also a pissy lawn.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, says Chafak.
Chafak says he is going to the castle for testing.
He has, among other things, made advertisements.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and similar to that of Finland.
However, he has to work harder, as there is always a replacement for the model.
We need to be stronger and more aggressive, says Chafak.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives €30,000 live art prize
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth €30,000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to her surroundings.
His work enables others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments that they have previously lacked, the board described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police find volvo in search: “We can’t tell where”
The search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of Juutinrauma and the Big Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själland was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police are searching for a black Volvo V90 in Sweden.
He is the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The car was found.
We can not yet tell where the car was found, Henrik Storm told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo is not directly linked to the threat.
He said the greatest danger is over.
Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet told the police at a news conference on Saturday.
Investigation Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was from the course of the clandestine operation.
He did not say what type of crime is being investigated.
Skov said it was a “serious crime.”
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people were sought in the operation.
Police do not say if they have been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the ferry traffic restrictions have been lifted.
The police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has reason to worry, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disagreement - now the people vote on it in disputed elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a new name.
According to the agreement between the Greek and Macedonian governments, the country will be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia’s efforts to join NATO and the EU.
The name Macedonia belongs to the northern province of Greece.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but it is asked whether the voter supports Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The ballot began at least at a school in the center of Skopje.
Oliveira Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped to support the agreement.
The referendum means change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, Macedonia was officially called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned in favour of the agreement.
Nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the outcome, it is exciting enough to see whether the voting volume will rise above the required 50 percent.
The referendum is not binding, but a “yes” vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The deal must also be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations will close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
A great victory!
Robert Helenius stumbled onto Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took the measure of his 36-year-old German opponent at the Waldenbuch in the Stuttgart square.
The main match of the evening was the IBF Intercontinental title match.
The winner may have the opportunity to compete in tougher positions than they have seen on Saturday, which are of considerable financial significance.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth half, when he struck Teper with a hard left-hand blow.
He could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third half, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the circle.
They had to go back in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed for injury and withdrew from the match.
It was then revealed that the German had failed twice in a doping test.
Helenius has played 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went to the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
Hamilton wins with 50 points to Vettel
The Formula One championship title was once again close to confirmation, with Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton winning the GP of Russia and stretching his world championship lead to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five games left.
Valtteri Bottas drove second in the race.
Bottas, who won his opening victory last year in Sochi, held the top spot in the mid-race, but Mercedes ordered Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel was third, Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
Two men murdered a man in the river and were caught at the end of the neighborhood.
Two men abused by beating and kicking a 31-year-old Juukalaisman in Joensu in Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 18:00.

The victim suffered wounds that did not require a doctor’s visit.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is leaving as chairman of the company’s board of directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
Musk has been fined $20 million for allegations that he secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the authorities and Musk's agreement is confirmed by the court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach a deal on NAFTA with the US
Time threatens to end in the midst of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The U.S. has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, has postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade talks in full.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
In late August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The U.S. and Mexico want to put the agreement into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday, so that there is enough time for the U.S. Congress to review it.
Neighbors thought the candle was a fire in Kaakkur - firefighters were alerted
Candles burned in an apartment in Kaakkur in Oulu caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
Dozens of rescue units were alerted to the scene due to a possible fire.

There was no fire at the point.
Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - bullying at the airport and metro station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo, West Nyland Police Department Criminal Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the detention was protection from crime and disturbance.
The detainees were released after the situation was calmed down, Värtinen said.
The news was earlier in the evening.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final show, a large group of spectators rushed to the field from the viewing room reserved for HJK supporters.
This resulted in clashes and clashes between the supporters.
In order to stop the situation, police officers were needed.
In addition to the field, the rafting took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where part of the capture also took place.
I was not there, but what I saw from the pictures, the situation was uncomfortable, Värtinen pointed out to the radicalization on the field.
As a result of the incident, no criminal complaints have been filed.
Tablestone stunned butterfly swimming in its SE-time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 competitions of the Swimming World Cup in the Netherlands.
The tournament will take place in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS’s Pöytäkivi broke his Finnish record in the 50 meters butterfly shower, where he was second in the initial sets in a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swam in Helsinki for the SE-time 22,77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, who represents the Espoon Cetus, was 24.68 in the 24 hours of the butterfly hunt.

Students play a rare delight: Ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia influences its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare taste on Finnish stages.
For the last time the National Theatre has seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre College brought to the National Theatre tour the only preserved theatrical trilogy of antiquity, Aiskhylos Oresteia.
In the Lavat open! projects, which began in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre College work internationally together with a professional director.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Its international premiere was held in Berlin in April.
Roha's Atonement for Orestia summarizes the story of the end of the bloodshed of the Atreus family, condemned to destruction, and the birth of the rule of law in a meritorious twenty-one-hour period, especially by compacting the choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine Finnish version (2003).
The dramatic lights and showcasing pages of the theater space emphasize a streamlined and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the performers who alternately break out of the choir, acting in nominal roles and the choir.
There are both double and triple interpretation roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and his captive Kassandra, are also shown on stage, contrary to what was customary in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the show does not emphasize its faithfulness to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, before the eyes of the viewer, a modern interpretation is created, faithful to the text, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of acting students at the master’s stage as a tight group, just as one organism.
Particularly in choir sections, actors inclined to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights on the stage bare, only decorated with a white curtain.
is impressive.
The performance tour of Oresteia continues at the Kouvolan and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer launches first hydrogen loader
The innovation is beginning to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement announced at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a new one-thousand-car batch for the Swiss company and its partners.
With the introduction of a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue to be a reference for Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are pushing fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refueling network,” Hyundai Motor’s Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the deal.
They have repeatedly stumbled in Cairo.
A 30-year-old man assaulted three men in and outside a restaurant in central Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside a restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he would push another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man in the situation, the perpetrator also hit him.
Police arrested the perpetrator.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the foot.
He also threatened the police with murder and murder.
He was taken to a prison to calm down.
The case is being investigated in three cases of abuse and violent opposition to a civil servant.
In the center of Kajaani on the Middle Street, a second abuse incident occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was abused by two men.
A 20-year-old man hit the victim.
A little later, another man dropped him to the ground and the man who struck him earlier even kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the perpetrators further away from the victim and called the police.
The perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
Police are asking eyewitnesses to contact Kajaan police by telephone at 0295 416 520 or by email at investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio conductor Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle’s longtime journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio conductor Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of untreatable liver cancer, which he on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is now going.
The doctor has said it, I live day by day, he commented on his condition to Iltalehd a month ago.
The safety of trade units and seats must be guaranteed
I first received a salary in 1984.
When a story gets you surprised, it’s usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and sometimes even a little angry.
I also talked to Erika Kähärää, a work environment expert at the Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, say otherwise.
Police are only aware of cases that are clearly serious and many real violence situations remain unreported.
“Unfortunately, companies have an obligation to statisticise their situation on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end in the statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always result in physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more severe than bleeding and wounds.
It is difficult to draw a distinction between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence when even a certain level of aggressive threat has to be counted as violence – even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even if the actual action does not happen.
Some residential areas are troubled.
The company has secured guards.
With the release of shops' opening hours, there was also a noticeable speculation in the media about its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, many employers arranged guard services at least for night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, you make a wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this creates a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well-held due to the surveillance, the idea arose that the surveillance would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
A mild abuse is a criminal offence, and it is understandable that the abused seller does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same paragraph of the 2011 law, mild abuse becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
We need precedents.
The next time a business aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be charged.
If the court put a few offenders in jail, and sentence from there on the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society in which food shops must be open almost night and day in small towns must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg tweeted to Miss before the live broadcast: "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss’s coronation will not be seen on TV this year, but will be broadcast on Viafree.
The show is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and Red Carpet run by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives about the progress of the broadcast.
Sohlberg initially asked the public to applaud Harjul.
All the women now!
Now look at this our male leader, Sohlberg cheered his colleagues as the audience cheered.
There are a number of competitions of the previous Miss India years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg turned his eyes toward Saroe.
More likely, Sohlberg referred to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
She spoke about her divorce for the first time in the week-end newspaper Eventa-Sanoma.
Missikaunotar said she did not want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public, as it is an affair between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he is not in a hurry with a new relationship, but he is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stories and especially I begin to live my own life alone,” said Sara Sieppi.
Harjula’s marriage status came to light at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio laughed.
Did I get married or how did it go?
Janni Hussey was injured.
A northern man tortured his bound mate by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The Pohjanmaan district court has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkol for numerous crimes against his spouse to three years in prison.
The crime was carried out with, among other things, a belt, cable and bandwidth.
The court sentenced those objects to loss to the state.
Ranki was charged with a suspicion of rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the District Court.
He was charged with four acts of abuse, gross abuse, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two injuries.
The crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the last acts, the man was arrested and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday, the Pohjanmaan district court issued a verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in the Vasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two gross imprisonments and a gross rape on May 22.
However, these allegations were rejected by the court as unproven.
The case was debated in court behind closed doors.
The judge gave a public account of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
By judgment, the court ordered the state to confiscate the instruments of the crime: a belt and cable, bandages, a bath belt, a knife and a watering machine.
Four witnesses
According to the court, the parties continued to co-exist.
According to the judgment, most of the most serious crimes occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses were heard, two women and two men.
A 34-year-old victim must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary injury of a total of 5,800 euros.
It is not possible for him to have that money, as he is already in debt recovery.
The prison sentence is not the first.
The police did not disclose the convict's name to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent judgment is not valid when writing this.
Europe Leads Four Points in Ryder Cup
European golfers captured their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10 to 6, while there are still twelve duels to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four quarterball matches that began on Saturday, and in the afternoon's quarterball matches the winnings were matched 2-2.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won all four matches on Friday and Saturday.
None of the European countries had ever done this before.
On Sunday, the two are looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a Ryder Cup, and no American has only won three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns harassment of supporters in Honka: “Violence is not part of football”
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behavior of its supporters during the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some appeared to be trying to challenge a dispute with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The officers did not calm the situation, but police and cavalry officers were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old club.
“We strongly reject any activity that endangers the security of the match events,” the statement said.
The HJK promises to assist the authorities and the event organizers in the investigation of security threats and in the elimination of mild effects.
Supportive culture is a part of football and an important thing for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyful and encouraging activities on football fields.
“Violence does not belong to it,” the statement said.
Philippine inventor uses drone to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to the growing crowd in the world who swear to have invented a flying car — or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such players as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports, he has spent much of his wealth building his dreams.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he flown with his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will arouse positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Work struggle actions starting tomorrow will be visible in children's daycare and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the ban on overtime and shift shifts, which will begin tomorrow, will be visible especially in social and health services and in daycare for children, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, chairman of JHL.
The effects will be extensive, and they will appear in the way that there is not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone has to think about how to find their children.
It is now the job of the employer to ensure that the services are at play and that no one’s life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when members of JHL were banned from overtime and shift work due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff has not been paid, but that the employees have been left in overtime or have changed shifts.
This is not a work struggle.
It is a norm for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government’s intention to lessen the protection of small against dismissals.
Markku Jalonen, the job market director for municipal employers, will not begin to assess the effects of the ban on overtime and shift shifts.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services can deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so unimaginably extensive, with social and health care and technical sectors that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already gained experience of the corresponding three-day operations of, among other things, the Association of Neighbors and Basic Caregivers Super and the trade organization of the social and health sector Tehy.
Their impact was relatively small.
JHL’s overtime and shift ban applies, among other things, to employees in the municipalities, the church, the state and the private social and health sector.
For example, family daycare is limited to the outside.
At this stage, the work struggle concerns almost 100,000 members of JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, the action of JHL may take a long time.
The union has also prepared for other work struggle actions, if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that this is running into the wall and hard.
He believes that both the AA movement and the government must stand up.
It is special here that the hards are already in the pitch, although the show has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is born with the strength of children and adults - in the fitness districts of the show, the gestures of a raven and a sea horse are studied
The Great Coral Reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltal.
Like the group’s previous works, The Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made during the initial exercises.
There is magic in the theatre for children too.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is not a children’s show, but a performance that adults and children work together.
It provides adults with insights and observations about how children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practical and joint play also diminishes the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat like a fairy tale ballet, a fitness circuit and a nature-themed awareness shock, but ultimately it settles in a different, non-human environment around the visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with an acquaintance with the pathways of corals, organisms living on coral reefs and fish.
In six different fitness districts, among other things, the gestures of a raven and a sea horse are taught.
Finally, there will be a less than an hour-long show where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both diving people watching the life of the coral reef and the corals being looked at.
There are also coral observers.
The eyes and observations directed in many directions make the show dense and life-shaking.
Whether it’s a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, or another organism or landscape looking at the organism – and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult.
With their exercises, the In Other Spaces group seeks to reach the boundary of thought and action, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
The involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held in Sitrator in support of endangered corals.
Destruction beyond human understanding should not be hardened, though it may be difficult to understand the meaning of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of destruction.
In other spaces, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, there are other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it makes room.
Children are growing up too quickly - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up with their lives because of drugs and sex, as others say they do.
I was shocked when my boyfriend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister’s “boyfriend” for the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told her about her sexual experiences that night.
I could not imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult matter.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by the boys.
I constantly see more and more young girls on Instagram, who are in pictures with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos at night.
It is difficult for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and even older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and playing board games.
In my childhood there were no smart phones.
I had been a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the state leadership that the case of Airiston Helmi was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, whom Yle interviewed, the protection police and the defence forces went to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that the investigation of Airisto Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organized crime.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by the Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the defence police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that this would be something else, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to YLE, no evidence of connection to national security has been found in the seized material so far, but an investigation is only underway.
We do not yet know what we can find out about it, one of the interviewees said.
The extensive home searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely an economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the case was discussed with both pro and against arguments.
Video: Liverpool Saved the Loss
Liverpool's hundred percent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and won 1-0.
At that time, Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everybody remembers the end of the season.
Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp arrived in West London.
The Reds started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own field finish alone.
Chelsea won the Champions League Cup on Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange to resolve the match with a fantastic individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard has been involved right from the start.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croatian saw Hazard crashing forward and sent him a perfectly weighed through feed.
Hazard rushed a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombarded a complete left foot bet in the back corner from there.
Poole's midfielder Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and only got his finger in the ball.
Klopp felt the defeat position slightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger wiped out the goal line of Mo Salah’s direction.
In the second half, Chelsea’s headquarters also took a real step.
The bass guard quickly responded to Sadio Mane’s appeal and pushed the ball from the root of the trunk to a corner stroke.
At the other end, Alisson scored Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firmino in his focus.
However, the brass star's bucket was directed toward national team-mate David Luizia, who saved the hosts' leadership position.
In the 89th minute, Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played on his old home stadium, and the attacker bombarded it to the top of an unbearable bet to honor it.
Liverpool's 100% league start ended with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the league peak - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also tightly involved in the championship two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer discussion, the tracks are deep
I remember a few decades ago when a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen’s answer was the only one left in mind: The End of the None.
Some have a nickname and some do not.
It can be found anywhere, and here is one.
In the European Union, Finland has made the decision to abandon the annual clock shift.
A lot of people agree that changing the clock twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide which time will eventually end: the current summer or winter time or another time zone.
People can also express their opinions on this topic on otakantaa.fi.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
The discussion takes place on coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Defenders of winter time justify their position by the influence of morning light on people’s well-being and defenders of summer time by the influence of evening light on people’s desire for outdoor activities and thus on well-being.
Both have strong supporters and strong arguments.
Studies have shown that the light of the morning rhythms a person’s day and gives them excitement.
On the other hand, if you do not especially suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outdoors and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn courtyard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been counted to an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but badly for our location in the northern corner of the Earth, we can’t do anything.
The winters are too dark and the summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical discussion on this topic is that one drives one’s own view and opposes another’s very sharply.
You don’t listen to the opponent’s arguments, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is somewhat useless to try to turn the other’s head.
It returns to waste.
The subject is extremely easy to argue because it does not require much effort and a mutual feeling is enough to justify it.
Such matters are usually discussed more sharply and equally fruitlessly.
It will be unfortunate if the wrong option is chosen, but it will also be adapted.
And it always offers a suitable sin pocket if life feels like an apple.
Joshua fought for the victory.
Josba’s first guest game in the Divar of the salibandy produced a total of three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the lead at the beginning of the third half, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50:47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored a 6-5 victory.
Both teams played crucial minutes at the same time.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fierce anyway, with Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hitting.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of birth.
Joshua has six points after three rounds.
The next O2-Jyväskylä will be in guests in two weeks.
200th Anniversary Celebration on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the church of Eno will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in part in a very sad mood.
The burning of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants to do so, the Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the communal and other associations in the world.
The family gathering begins in the church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the cottage next to the cattle’s breeding table.
There is a lot of activity throughout the day, both inside and out.
The church building can be visited, for example, with the guidance of Ari Räsässen, who has retired and worked as a churchmaster for 37 years.
The Birthday of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The building, built in 1982, is now open for the last time.
Now we are in the outskirts in the former town hall, says Captain Markku Koistinen.
The congregation house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chairman for $40 million fraud charges
Electric car maker Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed to a legal case with the U.S. Securities Regulatory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk of being guilty of securities fraud, and he was at risk of being put aside by the company he founded.
Musk remains CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to resign from Tesla’s board of directors for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman.
Musk is under stricter control.
According to the deal, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives to monitor Musk’s communications in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
“This decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, chief executive of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he could withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also said the company’s funding was secured.
The tweet raised Tesla’s stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of a securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it will sue the company and Musk in court.
The SEC has said it is demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running publicly traded companies.
The SEC’s challenge scared investors, and Tesla’s stock went down sharply.
More than 800 killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832 people, the country's disaster agency said.
The number of victims is expected to rise as investigations are underway.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final number could rise to thousands.
The earthquake caused a tsunami that hit the island of Sulawes.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the earthquake, but was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all of the dead have been killed, at least so far.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala near the center of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for assistance in the ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers in the search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the distressed area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work day and night.
One of the hubs of the rescue work is a hotel in Palua, where 50-60 people are believed to be still in the ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said one person was caught alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel.
We also heard people’s requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy eradication equipment would be urgently needed for the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help us in the area and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer appealed in a Facebook group.
Politicians' Phone Numbers Leaked to Brits
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
They also accessed the telephone numbers of the ministers.
This was the case at the British Conservative Party Congress.
For example, Brexit promoter Michael Gove, Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several members of the parliament received bullying calls.
Due to the app’s lack of encryption, the public had access to the politicians’ profiles in the Conservative Party’s annual meeting mobile app.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician’s email address. which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to exchange for a moment Boris Johnson’s profile picture for a porn film and title offensive.
Michael Goven’s profile picture was replaced by Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles with those email addresses.
Then the logger can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages on his/her behalf.
The meeting app made the phone number of every reporter, politician, and participant public, Foster criticized.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologized for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the application is now running safely.
The UK intelligence agency ICO supports the data leak.
The app was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticizes the Conservative Party for not being trusted in security matters.
Every week there is a large number of Polish whistleblowers in the audience of The Wall Finland.
The attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The fast-paced U.S. format The Wall was released in Finnish version on Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are being made.
The possibilities for shooting in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the 12-meter-high playing wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the opening period, the studio audience of the program was highlighted on social media, which was performed in Polish.
There was a debate on Twitter about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of four domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, clarifies the matter to Iltalehd.
He explains that the studio audience includes close friends of the players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish spectators.
In Finnish production, the audience consists of international tapers, just like the audiences of the The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the descriptions of various programs.
He reminds that watching the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is being played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
For foreign speakers, however, there are interpreters in the studio who handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who simultaneously interpret the events to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then directs the audience and tells what kind of blade is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to how he worked with David Hasselhoff recently in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Finland.
He had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of the ring.
Japanese Typhoon Strikes Towards Main Island: Authorities Warn of Floods and Landwrecks
Authorities are also warning of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and there are no reports of casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and more than 300,000 households have been cut off from electricity.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and locomotives have been stopped in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka around midday Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there is also a promise of strong winds and rains.
Trains were cancelled in Tokyo.
According to meteorologists, Trami will torture Japan until Monday.
The sky is darker
The start of the season has been bad.
The sky was already almost dark when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasan Sport on their home field on Saturday.
The Germans now have five consecutive losses, and points from six rounds have a total of two.
No defense team or two players from the lower chain have yet scored a goal.
The pressure is also increasing.
The sport against the public was dominated at the time when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have been played and there is no reason to give up.
We have to be worried because we played badly.
Particularly the performance of the second half was embarrassingly bad, Jarno Kärki said.
The sport of course tastes good.
The team had a game under on Friday, so I thought it would be visible in doing it.
It may have been, but they could not use it.
The amount of bread continues to increase.
Pirkko Hyvärinen, Mother of the Bread Day, is amazed at the crowd of the event in the big hall.
Somehow it was thought that not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, at the same time as the Bread Day, the SM competitions of the Traktorakynnön were held, so expectations would be that the number of audiences could even decrease a little from the previous year.
However, the contrary happened; the hallways were already sharply blocked before ten, the sellers that the products had exhausted, the news bullet was sold more than before in almost 500 portions and the number of cars in Hyvärinen was also heard to have increased.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
During the morning and afternoon, there was a large number of programs for children’s families, which attracted them to a record number of places.
Furthermore, he expects the event to go even further.
Salesmen also bend to Liper from a larger area each year.
This year, 100 speakers, craftsmen, bakers and harvesters had arrived at the breadholder.
Mother of the Day of Bread, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the crowd watching the hall.
At the beginning of the day the bread was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
There were 11 different kinds of bread.
The winner of the roastbread competition Marjatta Vepsäläinen spent a day at the martha cake shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Give life to the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tired eyes.
Good lighting is worthwhile.
We have put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The advice was given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes.
The importance of lighting increases the more years of age are behind.
Adequate lighting can help with the problems that many people experience with age, as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more people suffer from fainting.
The need for light is also increasing.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the treatment effects of light and the properties of the lighting for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not blink, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be presented with the right lighting solutions.
At this moment, the designer has the option to choose.
The Japanese style combines Japanese and Scandinavian style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also grown to a boom.
The authenticity is as fascinating as it is in the rest of the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Reveal your personality
On the other hand, home is now invested more than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold lighting for your home with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
Not necessarily buying the latest trendy lighting, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of thoughtless, jewelry-like and elegant classics keep up from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and see you!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoon and Brendan O'Donnell are separating.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three league matches in orange blue without any points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoho in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played for the Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and for the VHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new team is not yet announced.
A player wants to show an example in recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Nowadays, the gaming industry recycles not only gaming but also packaging materials.
Customers’ products are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled materials.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packaging from importers, for example.
All packages will be reused.
We can use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula from Oulu’s Playboy.
As a soft material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Bubbles are avoided as much as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving to recycling materials in envelopes.
They want to be an example to others.
Recycling does not cause any extra difficulty.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
This will also result in economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Playman’s activities, as in addition to new products, the main product range of the business includes, among other things, used games and devices.
Every fashion-conscious purchases: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classical clothes work from season to season in a different way than clothes.
With their multifunctionality, they create the foundation of a good closet, as it is easy to assemble a variety of clothes around high-quality classics even at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality clothes.
This category also includes black pools.
Black neule with pool covers made of natural material can not be a mistake.
The clothes can be combined with straight pants, towel and jeans, and around them can be created both a restrained housing and a rough style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a youthful modern dressmaker and a classic sophisticated stylist.
This creates style.
The autumn trend look comes from golden brown and wide-leather steampunk trousers, black pooloneule and gray ankles.
The classic pooloneule, together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish square hose and the wine-red loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated residential ensemble.
Bring the black pooloneule to shame by combining it with casual trendy clothes: jeans, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence sabotage has a long tradition.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name is derived from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja grupa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The Soviet security service’s KGB agents in the West are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB purchased uniforms and accessories for the DRG groups of the Bundeswehr, railways, wildlife guards and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian parachutists in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its homeland.
Agents during the Cold War hid packages of supplies containing mines, explosives, lighters and media for sabotage groups on the ground.
In 1998, a KGB hiding place was discovered in Switzerland, where an ammonia exploded when it was sprayed with water.
Police arrested four drunk drivers in the city

At the same time, a 18-year-old man in Contiogol blown 1.57 promiles.
He drove at 4:30 p.m. at the beginning of the night with two passengers.
On the Kuorevaaranti road in Polvijärvi, the car crashed into a pit at four o'clock at night, and a 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blown 1.54 promiles, according to the police.
He did not suffer serious injuries.
A 20-year-old man who was driving a passenger car in the outskirts in the centre of Outokummu blown 1.33 promiles in the alcometer.
The police suspect the men involved in the accident of drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi in addition to endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man who was driving a local cargo car blown 0.52 promiles.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are asking for observations of the gunfire that occurred at the railway station after midnight.
According to police, the man was abused in a parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on a surveillance camera.
The black-haired suspects, wearing dark pants and a brown or beige jacket, left on a dark pharmacy car in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect drove a bicycle to the centre of the city.
A pedestrian died after falling under the bus.
A pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after being struck by a bus.
The accident occurred in the afternoon at the space station.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK holds Risk in its ranks for the end of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important for the team in the starts, in underpower play and in the defensive role of the quarterfield.
Filip Riska, who played in the trial time at the beginning of the autumn, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been important for us in the start of the game, in underpower play and in the defensive role of the quarterfield.
Although there is still something to improve, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola said in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of the risk will rise when playing the hockey League’s decision games.
Riska, a center attacker from St. Petersburg, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Lukos and Sport.
At the same time, Oskari Lehtinen remained without a contract after the test.
Today's story on TV: The climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest.
This movie is based on them.
Everest will now have its premiere on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 film directed by Baltasar Kormákur tells the story of a struggle to survive, which has been dealt with with the crop.
There have been films and documentaries about the tragedy before.
Real events are also being discussed in this case.
The world’s tallest mountain killed eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers’s life may have been saved by an eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost his sight, so the conquest of the summit had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned.
But the battle of life and death had only just begun.
When the storm went up, he was lost and could not be found again in the camp.
When the man was searched, he was found in such a bad condition that he could not survive.
Weathers was left to death.
As a miracle, however, he still got on his feet and found others.
The worst-cold Weathers was thought to still do death, and once again he was left to his own luck.
Unfortunately, in spite of other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, his fellow climbers also began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old church is celebrated today.
The 200-year-old church is celebrated today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was prepared for Sunday in honor of the celebration year.
The feast began at the church hill of Eno at 10 a.m. with a family fair, after which anties of a carnivorous table have been offered at the church house of Eno.
The church was full.
517 people participated.
The priest of the church was pleased that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time and will give strength to work, says Iron Mountain (pictured).
The fire at the Church of the Danger has affected many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary celebration of the Enos congregation.
The church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran churches in Joensuu after the Church of Acceleration was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In danger of acceleration, a worship was held in the morning, where silence and remembrance of the church destroyed in the fire was held.
Photos and videos: The Medican spread its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-like storm hit Greece on Saturday afternoon.
The Mediterranean Hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Department of Meteorology has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photographs from the area show a lot of floods across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the region of Corinthia instead of a street due to flooding.
The other video shows how the car has been transported by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, heavy winds have caused heavy seagoing.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens has advised people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Embassy urges you to follow the weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane or Medican brings with it heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medications appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The now-blowing storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and into Europe.
Refugee camps in the Greek islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
During the summer, the hurricanes will also affect areas surrounding Athens.
There was also a medical crisis in Greece last year.
You should not go to the sea now, flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the fall storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking it is worth to be careful that branches or other bulk items do not fly over in the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to over 3,500 Finnish travellers in Greece through Sunshine travel over the weekend.
Instructions are needed as even a thunderstorm called Zorbas is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second.
The weather is increased by heavy rains.
All travellers from Finland to Greece via Solar Travel and Support, who have indicated their phone numbers, have been warned of heavy winds by text message.
The sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, the worst has been avoided by the start of Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and departed according to the normal schedule.
We are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety is ahead.
Antonia Schroderus, a media update for Tuim, says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are constantly in contact with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he said early on Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of about 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will hit Sunday morning.
On the other hand, in the afternoon of Saturday, the sun had melted on Rhodes and the temperature had reached 27 degrees Celsius, says Ikonen of Solar Travel.
Zorbaksen is expected to move to the next Turkish pitch, though slightly eased.
In this case, we have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked for example the number of Finns who flew to Antalya, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in the final - this is how they react to the situation
Media-person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-minded evening dress.
Hussi says she bought a dress from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me the perfect dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The same silver costume was also worn by Shirly Karvinen.
The two men also saw the same situation and laughed at it.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and that he had to set up on the plane.
Hussi plays as a backstage and red carpet runner in the final, and he talks about the front line stars arriving.
Huss has a new move behind him, as he moved from Kamp to Jätkäsa on Friday
I’m going to stay there for now, let’s see what happens.
The most important thing is that the new apartment has its own working room, Hussi thought.
Prior to his departure, he was on holiday in Greece.
It was wonderful, I only stayed in a hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered the curious eyes of retirees
The host and 2016 Miss Finland finalist Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had enough to do with radio stories and Love Island Finland recordings.
The hurry has even been enough to get Karvinen to the final directly from Finnair flight.
I put my hair and makeup on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Wearing clothes at home and laughing.
Karvinen says he pulled out his makeup among the retirees.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travellers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people’s eyes in the mirror.
It was fun, at least in the opinion of others.
He flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he playing Love Island as a Finnish runner.
He said his experience had been stopped so far.
Karvinen says he went to the show on Friday with the singles.
It is very cruel in some way.
They are people’s genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I get over-the-counter shoes?
Three perfect examples
Classical clothes are clothes that work from season to season in a different outfit than in a suit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the more modern ones can fit in.
A few years ago, the over-knee shoes that became the hit of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to their name, the shoes that reach over the knee are stylish from year to season.
Looking boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-knee shoes are actually suitable for any type of housing.
Whether it’s a jeans, pits, cloth or triko, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots will work.
Long shoes look great in both party and everyday clothes.
Black shoes are also very suitable for living in small houses.
They properly balance the femininity of a pink, flowery pliserie bracelet and a gentle, dull neule.
A fresh but stylish autumn everyday dress for a romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro-thinking housing ensemble comes from a long copper brown samet dress, over-knee boots, striking earrings and a small bag of nuts.
Although the upper knee shoes have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear in combination with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy shirt.
So easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Esbo
They will operate during the rest of the year and will take on passengers, Esbo city informs.
The robotic cars in Otaniemi will act as a bus simulator, as next spring it is planned to start traffic in the region with a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot a year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of the vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars can handle the current road network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment,” says Johanna Nyberg, head of traffic management.
For the first time, robotic cars will be fully automated in other types of traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicle is always the responsibility of the assistant passenger in the car.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether the road is free.
If it is not, they interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops are recognized by the stop marks.
The safest way to get there is from station number 1.
A bassist of Mokoma fell from the stage during a performance and was injured
The Mokoma group informs on their Facebook page about the unexpected situation at the Tampere Pakkahuono show.
Mokoma’s performance at Tampere’s Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage during the performance.
The incident occurred when the band was drawing the last piece of the evening.
The wrist broke.
The band informs about this on their Facebook page.
“We are alive!”

We wish a quick recovery to the metal brother!
The remainder of the tour will be handled by a substitute hiring, on the pages read.
Mokoma fans respond with concern to a photo update where bassist-Santtu lies gips in his hand on the bed.

The relief is great, the bones heal with time, fortunately.
Cheers for a quick recovery and good continuation to the rest of the band!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great show, but you promise to keep up with such a strong drama in the future? write one fan.
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savos
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department’s ferociers on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and license of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting license required on state lands.
In addition, the licenses for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted amounts of cartridges for self-chargeing weapons used in the pipeline were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found in the inspection, who lacked the required hunting license.
The hunter was sentenced to 12 days for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, the police blasted 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them are suspected of driving drunk.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic violations in fine proceedings, police times.
In summary, we can say that hunters observe the license of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised.
One hunter stated that “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked permits.”
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow Syria refugee quota selection
Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has accepted 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually conducted a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Migration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Commerce and the police.
The delegation is currently conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) selects especially vulnerable candidates.
In practice, it has referred to people who are considered to be in a disadvantaged position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected in the group of people coming to Finland than in the quota, because in practice some are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with non-governmental organizations on the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu’s border with Syria.
The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ilkka Salmi, is also on the way.
Increasing the quota
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 per year, but there has since been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The collective has been in favor of raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen to the resistance of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
Mykkäse’s visit is the first in this government period that the Interior Minister makes on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (collectively) and Paula Risikko (collectively) were able to take over their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for each refugee in a vulnerable situation.
Now we go home, no longer knowing whether to cry or laugh.
On Saturday, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
In principle, the bill prohibits the holding as production animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities of all animals which are not permitted separately by ministerial regulations.
Everything else is prohibited except the animals specified in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being a law, it would mean that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger society’s security or good manners.
In principle, prohibition of all activities which are not specifically permitted by law or regulation is now being enacted.
The change causes the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business activities and nothing else can be done before a law or regulation approving it has been issued.
In general, the government’s work on legislation has been weak.
If we now embark on the road that in principle in Finland everything is forbidden, what is not permitted separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
The Animal Welfare Act needs to be updated.
But such a law does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I don’t know the Constitution very well, but it may approve such a procedure as “everything is forbidden, which is not specifically permitted by law or regulation”.
Hopefully there will be a reasonable minister who will stop such a bill.
Metti Forssell: The Four Most Trendy Hats of Autumn

Turkey calls for cell phones to be charged in the event of a storm
The storm Zorba, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to spread to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists especially warned seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country of a storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
A tropical storm isly moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens early on Saturday night to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure Internet connection is functional so that people can get up-to-date status updates, the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind.
Heavy rains are expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow at 28-33 meters per second.
Red Warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek meteorological service issued a red weather warning for the southern Greek regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greek travel agencies have warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow the weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A few days ago when I contacted, there was a strong wind and it rained.
People were quite calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen of the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.

Kimi Räikkönen claims Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari has admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard in the time of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than us, but it’s not a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, said Räikkönen, who drove fourth and with his team-mate Sebastian Vettel clearly missed the Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
He was asked what caused the sudden crash from a Mercedes car.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, I’d probably go the same pace as them.
I do not know it more than anyone else.
This is an eternal guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, we saw a rare taste for Räikkönen’s future staff Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen in the next season at Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time session.
The 10th place for the Swedish is the best in more than three years.
And despite the fact that in the second run five drivers left out completely, the outcome was still tasty for Sauber.
And maybe an encouragement for the future?
Yes, if you compare with where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
There’s a different story next year, so let’s see.
Robert Helenius: “Robbe is back”
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more initiative party in the circle, but he did not get a decent hit.
A clearly more extensive Helenius controlled the match with his tough sets, which found a good goal.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The decision came in the eighth half, when Helenius beat Teper with his left straight.
The blow was so heavy that the man who stood in front of the audience didn’t even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius was very calm.
In the circle interview, he first praised the good atmosphere created by the public and his opponents.
He changed his language for a while.
Thank you to all the spectators and the Finnish supporters.
I took my belt today.
He was very pleased immediately after the match.
This was a huge victory for Helene’s career.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup, Helenius told Iltalehd before the match.
A defeat could have shattered the entire career.
Of course it came to mind.
This is not going to be any younger anymore, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before meeting Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may increase
According to the Guardian, the country’s vice president urged to be prepared for a clear increase in the number of victims.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescue workers are searching for trapped people as well as dead in the most affected areas of Sulawes: the port city of Palu and its neighboring town of Donggala.
So far, all of the victims are from Palusta, the situation of Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the building that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palua has collapsed.
Rescue workers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of removal equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered rescue operations.
There is a need for the army and its equipment because in the disaster area, electricity and communications connections are cut in many places.
Fuel reserves are also exhausting.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh.
A new Miss Finland is being elected.
During the interview round, a question was asked to each finalist.
The finalists drew the question of the glass cup on the stage.
Particularly the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, caused sweet but benevolent laughter in the audience present.
The answer to the question was made via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the last book a missy finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I’ve read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
The public laughed until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I read is...
I read books at school.
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I read is about economics by someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a roaring applause from the public with laughter.
Earlier on a mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when Miss Finland of last year Michaela Söderholm abandons the crown.
The apple-pearl cake takes your tongue
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples on your own, as the domestic apple is in the store at shocking prices.
You may have to buy a pear tree, even though a lot of pear trees are already growing.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don’t want to buy pearls.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you add the pear to the cake.
Shell the apples and pear and remove the seed houses.
It burned.
You can swallow in a cage.
Melt the eggs and sugar into foam and then add corn flour and melt butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch or maizena and baking powder and add it to the paste as well.
Add garlic and wheat flour, mix well.
Turn the bread slice on a baking paper, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the cup and spread pear slices on the sugar.
Put half of the paste on pear slices and apple blocks on the paste.
Finish with the apple blossoms.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Allow it to cool down and then turn to the serving table.
Cut the cake when it is cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the paste contains almond and corn flour that does not contain gluten.

According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status Symbols Don't Attract Friends - Four Facts About Popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have identified two kinds of “cool” with slightly different characteristics: the generally charming cool and the opposite dissident cool.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers, had many traits considered socially desirable: they were outward-oriented, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and shame.
They were thirsty for experience and cared little about external judgments.
Both types combined a good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardship is no longer cool: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who started dating early, billed, joined well-looking groups and sought favor from others had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they were worse off than their previously more reckless peers.
High-status luxury cars, branded bags or watches do not make a person cool – or at least not a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with their regular market shirt than with those wearing a mark shirt – despite the fact that most people chose a mark shirt when they met.
If you are on holiday in Greece, be careful!
The weather warning is shouting red.
During the weekend in southern Greece can rain as much water as in Finland on average in a half-year period.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the territory of the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announced it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning.
The storm is also on the weather service Foreca blog.
It is estimated that the strongest thunderstorms are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the hurricane Kuisma, which struck Finland from the beginning of the week, blasted at its strongest 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water could hit the south of Greece.
It accounts for about half of the annual rainfall in Finland.
Severe Weather Europe has posted a video of the storm on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the hurricane Zorbas caused floods in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize Love Island?
Showing up in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, Anku, a beautiful woman who has been squeezed by several men, also appears on strange YouTube videos released in 2010 as a man-in-law.
In videos, Anku advises businessmen, among other things, to prepare ink from an old economy paper roll.
The duck also shows in its sympathetic style how from the socks you can decorate a silk on which the right spikes grow.
Now we put the Easter grasses to grow, but let’s do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku suggests and introduces seed pudding, socks and seed pudding seeds, from which he makes a silk.
You can watch the video below or the YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shakes and shakes adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shake a little more than a dozen minutes after his GP GP pole race, while he was in front of the media.
A fine round left behind Mercedes' first star Lewis Hamilton and was mentally an important criticism for the Finnish rider who also collected this season.
A pleasant tour.
I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he left the decision round.
It feels good, I shake a little more, Bottas explained.
I’ve only been to the pool once this year, in Austria (in the middle of the summer), so the time has passed pretty well.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good runs again.
It is not easy to skip the track in Sochi, so the start plays a important role.
And of course Bottas had to answer the curious question of whether he will race for the win tomorrow or whether Hamilton is ahead of the world championship.
My point of departure is definitely that I will try to win.
There could be no other goal, but Bottas left.
We are fighting for both championships.
Lewis’ lead to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me is very big, so I have to keep that in mind.
Let’s see what happens, but Bottas added.
Hamilton was really pleased with the success of Bottas after the race, and what was seen for Mercedes's boss Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis had an intention to defeat Valtteri, but he failed in the standstill.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so loaded that the adrenaline was blowing out of his ears, Wolff whispered.
Asked if the team would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff responded by avoiding.
We’ll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish rally championship
The rally car series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally run in the surroundings of Turku and Salon by the windmills Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen secured his best achievement in his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheeled cars.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who compete with the Honda Civic, started the tournament with a malt because the starting points were clear: a position in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twin had to give a leveling when some of the additional lights failed with another special attempt.
It was a bit blind for the third time.
In such circumstances, it is not suitable to go.
On Saturday, only the speed of Jussi Tepo in the second series was tracked, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister urged the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
U.N. Secretary of State Walid Muallem said on Saturday that foreign troops should leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are fighting terrorism in Syria and that the war against terrorists is “almost over.”
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, the seven-year war has not ended.
More than 360,000 people were killed in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria is scheduled for October with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who accused him of harassment, took an extraordinary number of people to the box.
In the U.S., a full-fledged nomination drama for the Supreme Court judge attracted at least 20 million people to his television on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee telling their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more followed the online consultation.
NBC that the live stream was watched by 6.8 million people and CNN it had set its year’s record with 8.2 million live broadcast launch.
CNN’s number will rise to more than 10 million, counting those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launchers.
Digital launches are owned by the channels, TV viewers figures are from research and data analytics company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they’re shitty anyway.
Rarely reach 20 million.
With more than 20 million spectators in the U.S., sports competitions and the major Oscars and Grammy Awards in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 presidential debate, are usually accessible.
The final of the American Football League (NFL) Super Bowl is on the way.
This year’s Super Bowl has seen more than 103 million people on NBC.
Last year’s first speech to Congress was watched by 48 million people and 30 million officials.
Top important thing
The appointment of the Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge after Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-president Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
The second place opened when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but in a number of matters he was the so-called weapon whose voice could decide the position of a nine-person court.
She was a advocate of abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, decided by a vote that same-sex marriages were allowed throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock up the court's conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to receive information from their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health information of their children on the Kanta service.
It’s a big problem, it’s wrong and it’s weird.
At first, the situation with the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or prescriptions of young children.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken surprisingly long to repair.
Now the repair is promised - in 2020.
As the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a breakthrough.
Then, according to the layman’s understanding, it’s about pressing a button: when you now hold the stick, you open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her information to his or her parents - if he or she has a bank ID or an official identity card.
How many are 10 years old?
The ID card is paid, and bank codes are not even available for 10-year-olds.
Thus, in practice, no one can see the data of a fourth-grade elementary school student otherwise than by requesting it printed.
This is not so much a question of the rights of parents, but of the rights of children.
When it comes to child care, it is extremely important that parents can be involved.
The right of adolescents to privacy must be respected.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely discussed.
They are often associated with sexual health, for which free care is a profound human right.
U.S. FBI launches charges of harassment against Kavanaugh
The FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard the case.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation should not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and will not necessarily be made public.
Man threatens to kill police at police station in Kajaani
The robbed man continued to bustle in the chamber.
The police said they put the man in a police prison "to calm down."
Police were threatened by a suspected perpetrator on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The officials are informing of the case that started when a 30-year-old man challenged a quarrel in a central restaurant.
The man first abused another customer inside a food store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by dropping him to the ground.
When the third party tried to interfere, the man also hit him.
The trial resulted in a call to the police.
Police arrested the man and took him to the police station, police said.
The suspect acted aggressively at the police station.
He struck another policeman in the foot.
He threatened to kill and abuse police officers.
The police said they had taken the man to a police prison to calm him down.
He is charged with three abuses and violent opposition to an official.
Aid organizations prepare to start work in Sulawes, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Finland’s information director for UNICEF.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost every country, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency readiness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue operations are ongoing in the town of Sulawes, but in the region of Donggala, a little more north, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where the connections do not work.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also closed, Haru said.
The buildings in Sulawes are often lightweight, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is large.
Once survivors are found, they need shelter – first of all, tents – and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
In the first place, people are most often able to provide water purification pills, which Unicef has in stock.
The water systems are attempted to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and bringing families together is part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations.
In the early stages, previously raised funds will be used for emergency aid.
UNICEF has already started fundraising to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla, fined $20 million for tweets
Space rocket and electric car company founder Elon Musk has agreed to avoid fraud charges with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla’s electric car board and will be fined $20 million.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement he signed with the U.S. Securities Authority.
By negotiating, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud over his tweet in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which caused the company’s stock price to rise rapidly.
According to the deal, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "independent member" in its board and include two "independent executives" in its board.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay the equivalent of $20 million to the financial supervisory authorities.
Investors are misleading investors
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private equity company.
The billionaire tweeted that the company had been bought out of the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla’s stock price rose by more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours, but dropped later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the alleged funding.
He also did not discuss the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the board of directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell 14 percent after the SEC announced a fraud allegation.
The announcement is expected to reinforce the company’s position.
The final sentence is not a reason.
The clocks of the cathedral do not, of course, sound when the wise men do not move.
It is a technical defect.
The clock at the Tower of the Cathedral of Helsinki has stopped.
The wise men pointed to twelve.
The situation is like a medium-sized horror film: even when the crypt of the church would sound a whirlwind and the organs would sound by themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has been broken.
It has been checked by a repairman, but some part has been broken and a new part is expected, says Suntia Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
In fact, the account states that the final judgment is not the reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen says the church clocks don’t ring because of the defect.
