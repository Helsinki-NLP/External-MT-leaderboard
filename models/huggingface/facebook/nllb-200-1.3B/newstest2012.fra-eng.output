Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to the criminal law, a proposal to abolish the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected at second reading the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister who is currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a disadvantageous a priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is due to rule on the convict's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the verdict political revenge by the regime and has provoked a process of suspected court bias in the West as well.
The draft to abolish section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to pass.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are yet to be determined.
As is the custom in the region, the winners of the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has declared the customary law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya is becoming a crime-free country because you cut off your hand for stealing.
Women can forget about emancipation, any disrespectful of the faith is punishable by death...
It is the Koran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator the society made up of opposing tribes.
We must not forget that the situation in Libya is one we cannot imagine and certainly would not want to see.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and probably would not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist fighters have gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it wasn't an American general who was directing the NATO strikes but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have participated in the shooting, we have served Islam and our politicians have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there's no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crossed".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of a protection of human rights that is in its own interests.
We're about to be stopped by these Sharia followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the crosshairs of investors.
A tornado of statistics has passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany were growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have published their third-quarter economic development forecasts earlier.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (originally a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecast data and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and EU economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2%.
The yield on the 10-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields on the bonds of Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won Montenegro 1-0 and are celebrating the 200 million qualification
The football team has accomplished its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Czech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has defended its qualification with a good deal of luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first half and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to super Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with a 1-0 win over Montenegro and celebrates its qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second half because of a very precise Czech defence.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes, we played a little warrior football.
Both teams had difficulty in putting up combinations and the game was mainly centered around the centre line.
The pressure from the national players did not break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have built a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities set up a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They have thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently reported that Iran has been steadily increasing its nuclear arsenal.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: no breakfast and some charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As recent research shows, children who are obese come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment in which humans evolve and the patterns around them are.
For example, the tables of obese children are 50% more likely to be filled with snacks than those of normal-weight children.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not an accident"
In families with small children, sports are also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren - only 15% said that at least once a week parents find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from Czech primary schools.
This was the second edition of "Obesity Is Not an Accident", sponsored by the General Health Insurance Corporation and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have signed up for this project.
One of the major factors causing a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed say they eat, for example, five times a day breakfast - in this case - lunch - snack - dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition", says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and snacks at dinner.
Experts point out that healthy development requires a few basic things, such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the students' families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families with obese children were more likely to eat unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sweetened beverages every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed exercise regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
You make your own food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from options offered according to their own personal taste and opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats, and sweets.
"The most alarming is the high preference for sweet lemonade", the survey results state.
For lunch, pasta took first place, right before white meat.
The children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health policy
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"In a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not an accident' awareness-raising session, a strong desire to move towards a healthy diet was observed", the survey results state.
The most striking example was in the case of sugary lemonade, as children began to prefer drinking water.
The children most often checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce to sweet dishes and "knedliky" (a Czech specialty of bread or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little bit angry that there were a lot of them from the start.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three specialists, the costumes of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams, more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there's a class on Saturday and Sunday, it's really "drunk".
This time we discussed with Principal Alenka (there are no boys in the class) how to dress a woman who does not have standard sizes.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another one of overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce the width of the arms, lengthen the neck, or add the necessary curves.
We've gotten to the point where we've been able to emphasize the character beautifully and also not dress too prominently for women like Jennifer Lopez with strong breasts and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not fit at all, it is worthwhile to have it made to measure.
And you won't regret it, because a dress that falls perfectly is priceless.
A tailored skirt will feel much better than one that is always sliding, curling and not attached to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance, Tucker-style clothing may be affordable, with pieces of sewn fabric or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'm going to have to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my heart, I like it, because it's better than wearing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost 100 kilos recently (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physicist but also creates, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on given products, trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a designer and designer, told us about all this.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a big vision
Three special guests gave a varied look at Saturday's session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer, were also invited to the exhibition.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single outfit in different ways.
Variability is essential for this example.
For example, this trench coat, which is meant to be worn in a classic fashion with jeans and a T-shirt as a light coat, but also it can dress the naked body, with scales and take a picture of it as a dress.
Or you can just pull up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it", he pointed out.
But I especially appreciated the advice: "To get a job, you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to go against it", Jakub said.
I finally understand why we try so hard to learn these rules, what to do with them, what to do with them, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No comment on the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than are photographed.
That is to say, for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different from what they really are.
We have to count on that during a model creation.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, who is not a great singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still fragile.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seem to be comes second).
And if someone gets a styling done by us, then we have to rely on the fact that they dictate to us with a high probability a size completely different (smaller) than what they actually have.
Then we just have to go google and see if the news bulletin is about the celebrity in question, if she's gotten thin or fat, etc.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it is not enough for a designer to know how to dress and how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he's dressing in, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items you can't just throw it all away and say, 'Oh my God, what a disgusting thing.'
"You can find some things that you like and you can advise him on what to wear them with", says Mario.
He showed us in concrete terms what everything must contain in what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around your waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined items such as scissors, hair-removal rollers, or baby pins, there are also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten a garment to the back if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple cannot be used because it could damage the garment), or a sewing kit.
So that we would not just be people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to make shoes look right.
And during the photo shoot in the studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, especially on the outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors to avoid accidental injury.
So it really takes skill.
Mario was delighted when he congratulated me on my creation.
The skill I'm referring to is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes.
I'm starting to realize that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, no matter what anyone says about it.
The need for speed is being debated across America.
Revised
What used to be a smooth race turns into a routine morning commute to work because of a bunch of stupid mistakes by people who don't care.
This fulfills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do more.
The new installment, subtitled The Run, generated high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aging Need for Speed racing series and to come up with a kind of game from the playable parts that would not just count with points.
So we were curious about what the extra passages would be like where the main character gets out of his car and does whatever he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing is going down because of some unnecessary bugs that have been around for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts off very well.
You're caught up in an adventure where the main character Jack has a personality problem and to solve it, he starts to participate in illegal racing across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
There are some interesting elements to the idea.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
The result is that each race is run on a different route and the stages are planned in different environments which are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite beautiful even if the graphic level is the same as in the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, through autumn landscapes, or through mountains covered with snow is very pleasant to the eye.
The tests are also occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your vision.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche doesn't hit you.
Besides, the various races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to outrun the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you run against the clock (classic duel with the chronometer) and then you are in for another duel with an opponent.
Sometimes you also have the police coming in and trying to make it difficult for you.
The newest are the off-vehicle crossings.
It's more of an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you'd expect (to be specific, there are only three).
The result is that this element is not likely to interfere and, in the context described above, is one of the elements that enhance the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of the previous games.
Which means that there's nothing extraordinary about it right now, but you can't say it's negative.
As for the realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But while we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So it's all right.
Problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the stage of development.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated warp and collision game, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car is behaving, so it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes off in wild turns.
Or it ends up in pieces.
Thanks to the restart system, it's not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you break your face or you go out into the scene the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have five restarts.
When you've used all five restarts you have to start the game all over again.
So it's more of a tool, in case something goes wrong, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarts don't help and you have to find the solution by memorizing the route piece in question.
The big thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that you have to go through in a certain way or you don't get through.
Otherwise you will encounter "civil" vehicles at a given location, always in the same configuration as if you were first, fifth, five seconds early or one minute late.
What is annoying is the situation where you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and outline them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of it because it's "calculated" in such a way that for any given situation it always comes right up to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you get to certain places, again, no matter the time, and you always have the same opponent ahead of you in the same place.
It's most annoying at the end of the game when you're driving on a long bridge in reverse.
The enemy must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you, it blocks your view of other vehicles in the opposite direction, and you collide with it many times.
It's understandable that the aim of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it's clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving pattern the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea was to change cars during the races.
You have to be careful about petrol stations on the routes because you can change cars there, but most of the time you just have the one you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and exotic super sports cars on highly technical drives such as mountain lace roads.
And the challenge mode, which is racing in particular places that you know from the adventure, goes very well with the main story regime.
You get not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile of common challenges and adventures.
When you reach the highest level of driver, various objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest blows to grasp is the situation at the final race of the adventure.
You get in your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator will tell you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and a subway train will come behind you and send your car straight to the scrap yard.
We had a discussion at the editors' office for a few days about whether anyone actually thought about making this game or whether the writers really think we're idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
The problem is that in more extreme situations, the imagery doesn't hold up, and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image is no longer of any use to you.
The sound is good, and the track is optional.
In order to appeal to the widest possible audience, and especially the youngest, a new soundtrack was created in the "I mix everything" style, but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
So the general impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in years.
But this game feels like it's not over.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of an airfield spotlight.
The students of velvet in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czech people are acting like negative and Eurosceptic
'The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions'
"I didn't expect such a hard war".
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new roles", Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her presentation at the Faculty of Law.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way that many lecturers at the Charles University Law School might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto 'comprehensible and open about Europe' very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, there were criticisms that he was bland, that he was a complete fool, that he could not complete any missions and I must say that he took everyone's breath away because he plays his role perfectly".
'He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction Europe should take.'
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: 'Who is who in the European Union?' 'What phone number should I call?' as an important step towards uniformity and greater legibility of the Union's policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky.
Mrs Vicenova also spoke of the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have solved the growing financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, 'the activity has been full' not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which is still solving itself.
The new seven-year budget of the Union must also be approved, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Since the budget seems to be thin and in the interests of saving money, which sector will be given priority, which countries will receive the most or the least aid, all this will have to be resolved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans on her arrival in Brussels: 'For a Europe that is understood'.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, no one makes banana of different sizes or no one has forbidden us to make syrecky".
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is on the way
The Ambassador said that the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative rather than positive aspects.
It also regretted the fact that the Czech Republic was so underrepresented in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, was due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a motivation letter and the lack of support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, the Frenchman says, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is that group in Visegrad doing?' and he's not happy at all".
Mrs Vicenova said that in the near future the Member States would have to face new tough rules on budgetary policy.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the euro area".
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute for enhanced cooperation".
First, it was said that countries that wanted to cooperate with each other and those that did not want to stay in their corner".
'There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,' Ms Vicenova expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the task of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only the eurozone members.
History of a brand
The innovative IBM begins its second century
If one were to look for the word that most closely expresses IBM's strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, a firm that is felt to be very modern and yet a hundred years have passed since its creation.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first CEO, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left behind this slogan that a great many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant would develop (and also the title of the in-house magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the corporate healthcare culture developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means thinking long term, moving forward.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
It has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more", said the firm's current director Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was great at the beginning in finding talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who is expected to replace Palmisano at the helm of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing what's called jamy over the last few years, online brainstorming, and a lot of future strategies and innovations have come out of that.
It's no wonder he has a lot of ideas - there are almost 500,000 people working in the firm.
An institution with a good name
The internal and external image of the company is what gives it a secure position in the business world.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard Business School and author of the book IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world by using its technology", added Geogre Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there's a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States for its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown into one of the world's largest firms.
It's obviously the most versatile technology company -- it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services, from server products to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from every American technology firm and five of its employees have won a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are the cash machine, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second largest technology company by market capitalization this year with $220 billion (first is Apple), when it first overtook Microsoft in 1996.
A preview of the project
Not all innovations and manufactures have been the preference of the customer and the time - IBM, for example, has not succeeded in betting on a proprietary OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"As long as your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past", observes Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work they leave.
Unlike competitor Microsoft, for example, which is based on the Windows operating system.
Technology with a future
In IBM's revenue, services, which are formed by software and hardware for one fifth, have a dominant position.
However, even in 1990 it was with more than the strongest participation motivated representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, and during that period invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM trades under the guidance of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression also increased his investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is passing through the current crisis without being worried?
The share price of IBM has skyrocketed from 2008 to the present by 120%, and the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but its values.
We can expect that this flexible giant will overcome further crises.
The history of IBM: From slices of cheese to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally under the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - originally a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the old "pointing" clocks, which recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - Watson's ideas have been the basis of the company's identity and culture to this day.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started with the production of all the machines possible for business and commerce -- from cheese and meat cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales multiplied to $9 million and the firm began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the firm that after 40 years as chief executive it was his son who took the chair of the board, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA guide flights into space -- to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that set the standard for computers at the time, the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that's been successful at IBM for the last three years -- is the concept of a smarter planet.
Its aim is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
In the area of commerce, IBM has recently developed a 'Smarter Commerce' platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It opened its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research and development team working on speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey. I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
But she couldn't wait and set clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner",Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova shelter in her summer home, she had no idea that their marriage would not last.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not turn the singer down.
And he confessed to her in public.
In time, Darina gave in, accepted her husband's affair, and eventually said goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him at the doorstep of the house.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out".
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", Rychtarova let it leak, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina shut her down is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change".
"My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect that".
"The company goes on, I do the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy".
"I talk to Darina in a completely normal way, but we don't sleep together", Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she's with or if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women - do you too?
If you ask men to identify the typical vices of women, they are all equally capable of getting them out of their "sleeves".
Ladies, you will learn in the following lines of the female vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
Purchasing
Does your partner ever make any comments about you being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
You're happy to buy and pack at the time of sales?
In your case, we can call shopping a vice.
Some women feel they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you might say, who would not look through the window of a clothing store, look for some pretty clothes for themselves and then try them all on in the booth (ideally in different colors)?
And while shopping is a hobby for most women, it can be hell for men.
Just think how many times you told your spouse to wait at the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"Should I lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases remind you of something?
- You want to?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with their looks.
It's not that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about how they look.
The stronger sex will not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints are, the more toxic the women become.
Cleanliness and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless ride.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, dust, and clean the bathroom - twice a week.
You make comments to your partner about walking on dirty feet on the clean floor, to the kids about them dirtying the sink, smudging the living room window, and that it's giving you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first priority in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even the peace of your family.
The work of sap
"Throw that worn-out sweater in the trash".
"Are you gonna wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has no place on the floor".
If you do this undermining job on your partner like that several times a day, you're really gonna break it down.
It's obvious you don't mean anything bad. You want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to do all that underwater work...
The defamation, the perjury
Slander, perjury and even insults are also common to some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and are therefore happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us is letting out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
Hand on heart is a woman's thing.
But the worst are those who give advice, abuse, even despise others and are especially dangerous to those around them - especially in the workplace in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jagr was a two-time participant in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr told reporters across the Atlantic after the game that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Anytime that feeling hits you", Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the paddle and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, home plate player Patrick Dwyer made a run, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's really in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him".
"I'm really happy about that".
"I want to play on him".
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team tried to play me, now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty kick she finished with a goal difference.
Matt Read didn't rule out other complications, which ended in a two-on-one.
"Pronger has been performing excellent attacks in our area".
"He tapped on the paddle, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it", Voracek describes the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia came in with this win to lead the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo, he was out in the second-third due to an injury to his upper body.
The Canucks failed to face an experienced defender their two-butset lead was lost after a 2:3 penalty shoot-out.
Tomas Plekanec hasn't turned any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that bothered the local coach more than lost fists because they played the game with only five defenders.
"This sucks".
"We played the game only with one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"But there's nothing to do, it's just the way it is", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement after replacement it was not enough and we could not resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the paddle out of our zone".
We had limits to that", added one of the advocates, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender who took part in the 30th attack on Winnipeg and the victory at Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters participated in the Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists went on holiday to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime started to have a westward inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (including Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the case of Czechoslovak citizens who wished to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, they needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not permitted.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but you had to either wait in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" with the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, convertible and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages which the Czechs bought themselves and this custom continues to this day.
Since 1989, the Czech travel industry has undergone a major revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not realize today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries in the West has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for long travel by plane to the west which everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel agencies would put Czechs to sleep in tents in parks because our income was not enough to pay for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of a Czech traveller in those days was to take with him his own canned food, sausage, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the exchangeability of the Czech krone, which allowed our tourists to finally, after decades, be free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have risen, which has caused another important moment around 1997.
As a result of the growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to offer tours since 1997 with charter flights, which have been greatly reduced in cost by means of contracts compared to what was available before.
In the late 1990s the Czech Republic had visa-free connections with virtually all the developed countries of the world except the EU, which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism after the revolution was when the first charter flight to an exotic country, Thailand, was arranged from the Czech Republic.
As every year, direct charter flights are taking Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
That's over 100,000 Czechs visiting exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully enter the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 000 crowns per person on holidays abroad including the associated costs.
The General Assembly must find its President but it may end in a situation without a solution.
The Czech football is without a president for almost five months and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hasek as head of the Czech Football Association will not be known after another General Assembly which is due to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting procedure to follow.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football into the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football return to divergences between the Association's chambers who could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations were blocked and there was no discussion of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or even the full-powered officials.
On this one point there has been a partial agreement since then, with the help of the Office for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full powers is not possible.
The disagreements still continue about the election rules.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations has not contributed anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the crucial point remains the same.
The question is, how do we proceed for the third round so we don't fall into the bed?
"The point is either to follow the rules or to find another model", said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Republic's football association, Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football in the association.
The rules of the proposed model are that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to withdraw so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes in both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is considering the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"Only then would the idea of the previous two rounds be lost and the bicameral concept completely rejected", admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and who believes that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the electoral rules established by the statutes benefit the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I want the maximum number of votes according to the statutes of the association".
"So that there are no more foolish ideas imagined by a representative as in previous General Assemblies", said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a first-time candidate and who in his speeches has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He said that in Nymburk there would be a new President and believed that the candidates would cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification for the European Championship today should calm everyone down".
"Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there will be more incentive for cooperation", adds the Jablonec official who has the most experience of the three in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the rules by drawing".
"This may cause a blockage at the General Assembly again".
"I still hope that reason will win", Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a joint agreement by all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole football management will be complete for the match.
The special chartered flight to Podgorica, which was to carry Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
The final decision should be taken at the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would be very happy to welcome the divided parties in the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
There are many things in the game: state funding, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which has to determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to the fight for the presidency because he doesn't see any right candidate.
If Plzen's football manager Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that his profile would have met all his demands for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not have been campaigning for this high office.
"If there is such a candidate, I support him, I fight for him and I do not stand for election".
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate", Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT, who would be given a priori as the favorite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if he won the elections he would only hold this position as President until 2013 when a General Assembly is scheduled.
He would see in the position an experienced manager of high level but who is not connected with the world of football.
"I have spoken to people who might have the profile", he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment".
"I would like to change that image", he added.
What is said to be most troubling to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union, Roman Berbr, a man of disreputable reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of the delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta should occupy this position of President.
"If he wins, the current state of affairs will remain and there will be nothing new in football".
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-end trader, it would be even less favourable to football", Paclik proclaimed.
What shocks him even more is the fact that Pelta's name was mentioned a few years ago during a hearing in a corruption investigation, for which Pelta got away with nothing.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football".
"And how would we be seen by UEFA and FIFA?" says Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I will sell the Plzen club".
In the event that Paclik wins the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he can cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco, feels the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with".
"He has great capabilities"
"He could run for president, for example".
"But as the manager of the Association he would not be able to".
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know", says Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the arbitration panel with Ludek Macela replacing Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he's qualified to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private companies and he has also been running the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support last May its triumph in the first division.
"I have the power to make a difference in the world of sports and to bring a certain culture".
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commissions, which leads to situations of bad taste", added Paclik, who does not shy away from his antipathy for Sparta boss Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level politicians would allow sport to get more money from the tax on the games.
"That's one of the key points the new president should address".
"If it's the tax on gambling as the political parties are saying, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he said.
Paclik does not take his current affair with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
I don't see any reason to pass on my shares of the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later", Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the stalemate.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should end in the future the quarrels over the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of today's football representation should calm this warming before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election which did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to securing financial means if elected.
He decided to run at the last minute just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay might well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday to be President".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the management of the Association", he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years at Sparta and on the Union Executive Committee.
That's also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that the current election problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone saw".
"If it weren't for all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September", Pelta stressed.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has caught the delegates' attention.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am prepared to take full responsibility if it doesn't work out".
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist", Pelta added.
Then, it is said, he tries not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognises as having a background in law, and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate will be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and has had some success".
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign".
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character", Pelta told his opponent but said he remains true to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football display case.
"And I'd also strive to finish every case that starts with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal".
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football", the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees", he told Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios envisaged with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will get over it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when a new leader is in charge", Pelta optimistically declared two days before the likely decisive day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, it will not please many people", he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football as a whole".
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth football".
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do it alone", Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the powers within the Executive Committee so that each member is involved in a specific area".
"And I'll be handing out tough assignments to get football a big step forward".
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others", he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of the critical atmosphere.
"As for me, everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on every single one of my actions", explaining why he was hesitant.
"Many people told me I shouldn't give up because they would give up too".
"It's a trust I can't betray", he said.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work he started with Hasek.
"There has been a lot of work done over the last two years and I don't want to let it go".
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would return to what it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do".
"Behind him are people who would make football so that it would be only for those who were chosen".
"I can be blamed for a number of things but I certainly can't stand any of them".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second division into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division".
"There would be no situation like the one we have now with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is finding young players.
Since Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I feel constant support from the Czech Chamber which elected me as its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes", said Rajchl, who envisages saving tens of millions of kroner on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating contracts with TV stations and the law on gambling among his future successes.
He says, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year".
"If elected he would certainly continue what Hasek started and make no notable change among the people in the Commissions".
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success", said Rajchl, who was assessing his rivals.

UFO-optic swings, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: Travelers to Europe can experience the blue wonder - and after sightseeing or a long walk - can rest their tired legs in gas-water baths.
One book shows which swimming pool can be the most comfortable.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there was one item that should not have been missing from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If she liked a covered pool, she would write down in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools have been surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and she has presented them in her already published book "Badefreuden" - the municipal covered pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has conducted her "trips to the most exceptional baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true devotee of the bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn't have much interest in sports but she feels drawn to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming enthusiasts have to look at blue tiles and take in the stench of bleach while joggers can breathe the enchanting scent of spice forests or can listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly", said the Viennese woman.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths".
The surface of the water doubly strengthens the architecture
A dip in a pool and the volatile sauna oils - the wellness factor in swimming pools is huge because all the senses are aroused, according to Meder.
And if the builders had put in a little more effort, swimming pools could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor, there is a water surface in swimming pools".
"It is transparent on one side, but on the other side it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
All surfaces are optically represented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, spring tiles.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" is an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture in the historic oasis of well-being - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered some remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While the roof of the Zurich bath offers a view of the whole city, the snow-capped Arlberg can be admired from an outdoor pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which one can watch the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach doesn't come from every pool in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths give off a sulphur smell, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba a strong oil smell, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its mucus sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
Iris Meder's search for beautiful swimming pools also led to disappointment. When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded area.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking out the window of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she observed weeds blooming between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the thermal palace of Bad Wildbad.
The building has already survived three phases; not only are there elements of neo-Romanesque architecture that have been evident since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish Alhambra style hall added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because she is from the Schwarzwald.
"It is already a beautiful achievement to merge so many different building styles into such a wonderful unit", says Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank giving up its commodity speculation?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw conclusions.
- What is it?
The Federal Republic's citizens are clear: According to a survey, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on commodities such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of those questioned even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business because it adds to the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey of the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that stock market speculation on global commodities is driving up prices and that banks are complicit in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete alignment with the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Speculation on commodities was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that bettors have detached themselves from supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from his American competitors: he promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No case is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake".
According to reports from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, after which the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the Bank's President will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann building his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how badly the banks today harm the public interest".
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obliged today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments for which money has been invested in food speculation", Bode said.
"It does not matter to Mr Ackermann whether it is a question of starving people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake".
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything in the Board's plans.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And as for any losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will.
One in two would cancel investments in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a heavy hold on the manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute carried out questionnaires on 7 and 8 November with 1001 people.
Only 11 per cent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also be personally affected if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, cancel all investments where money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would not recommend such a bank to their neighbours, 49 per cent said they would consider closing their account to change bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending: the Austrian pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition hall.
If one is enthusiastic about modern postwar architecture, its clear forms, its glass hangars, its bold and bold movements and its new building materials which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day as an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for as long as it was, until the new building in Vienna was given to the Contemporary Art Department.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has been deteriorating.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was led by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvédère gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an art skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out transformation work with politicians and monument protection, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation of it.
Except for contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, were exhibited, a café and a bookshop are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict supervision, low budget
Krischanitz was the ideal performer for the production.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the Joseph Olbracht Secession and won the competition, but also because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the Pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and its change of use.
The current transformations have had major problems: the building was "an energy gap", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fibreglass was installed and the roof replaced by special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled roofs were repaired.
Two basements have made room for the new exploitation, a dim light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, and the house is painted in a rust-resistant reddish-brown hue.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the authorities responsible for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often good and cheap materials had to be found, and which also appeal to the monument protection office", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a good conscience".
But in this case the 21st century house is not in the wrong place, because if it is a lucky urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "central station district" with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may be coming: the 21st Century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art center in Berlin, and as is said, she is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in the millions.
The railway company has developed a contingency plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million this year.
The daily Bild-Zeitung reported earlier, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments totalling around EUR 300 million were planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the de-icing of railway installations and platforms is expected to double to 16,000, among other things.
The aim is to clear the docks of snow and ice before the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment needed for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the stationmaster Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with passenger transport, because it lacked reserves in case of severe weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had to deal with this for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often in the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the USA.
After the case of the boss Josef Ackermann, there is news in the USA: the German bank Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough, the giant's past in the sector is catching up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle a dispute over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's the sale of mortgage papers.
The NCUA, the financial market regulator, accuses the large banks of having encouraged the cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products, which would have minimised the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and drove the banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this without the parties going to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not admit any error in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the cooperative banks of the USA and intervenes in bankruptcy cases to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks to task and in the summer it sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, this is 'Mortgage-backed Securities'.
The credit unions are the foundation.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a lot of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events of the past few years are still blowing a storm over the American banking system.
Investors and supervisors have brought numerous actions for redress or sanctions.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two US state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of taking advantage in kind of mortgage deals worth some 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint with the FHFA, which concerns several transactions totalling USD 14,2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities requested that Frankfurt pay for 'substantial losses', but did not specify the amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it would defend itself.
Warren Buffett is up 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums of money in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought over $10 billion worth of stock.
Until then, the great American investor Warren Buffett was constantly explaining why he did not invest in IT companies, because the long-term evolution of companies only gives us bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his mind about investing in this sector.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a chivalric attack in the financial world.
The IBM TI business is therefore entitled to be known as 'Mr IBM'.
Because Buffett revealed today on the CNBC business show that he's bought since March of IBM stock worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became a major shareholder in IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM never knew about this engagement until now.
He commended the management, which even during the economic crisis had made reasonable profits.
"You did a great job", Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been investing in the lucrative IT services as an operation of the accounting centres for some time.
The pioneer in computing, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett has so far been rather averse to tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
But Buffett is more into rail freight, lubricants and machine manufacturers.
Berkshire Hathaway holds almost 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and had built it into one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to clever investments.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM shares went up one percent on the stock market.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a market value of over $220 billion and is, with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to be a part of it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable.
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media are questioning the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" now being revived.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the specter that was long thought dead is reappearing: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
There is xenophobia in Germany, but it has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions the size of which is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology?" was the headline of the Turkish daily Haberturk's online edition.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors was a v-man from the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the mud of the far-right.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted in a reasoned way: it has called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The cohabitation was staged in bright colors, symbolizing a successful story.
Some Turkish media reports are a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" therefore does not shy away from drawing from it unambiguous conditions.
"It's starting to get old", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was widely criticized on German-Turkish forums and subsequently debated the success of their investigations.
The authors wonder why it did not occur to the German authorities much earlier to investigate certain suspected extreme right-wing circles.
Many are willing to resort to rhetorical or even drastic measures: "If the matter continues to falter, migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and arming".
"that would be the best self-defense".
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the appropriateness of punishment of the whole network", writes "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger is well explained by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply ingrained in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of "we" in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks, which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech how much tax the local Turkish population was producing.
As if a man's worth could be measured by the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deeply distrusted many German-Turks have been of the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the situation of far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zurich Bank Scandal
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been going through one crisis after another.
A German must lead now.
It's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly cheered, saluted Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has passed the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as September came along, it was clear that everything was about to change.
A London-based UBS securities dealer had hijacked all the bank's security systems and stolen about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS board of directors, Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since been considered ill - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We've already learned that Weber can be a bank advisor from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board as early as May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is getting difficult.
He's not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
In a single stroke, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of 'Europe's biggest scandal bank'.
Indeed, on the one hand UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the quiet, solid, yet cunning Swiss asset manager was combined with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large investment bank.
So UBS was managing on one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger, who later taught banking for many years in Zurich, recalls: "I always took UBS as a model of a good bank for my students".
"In the present light, you ask, how could I have been so wrong?"
He was profoundly mistaken.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli, who had been regarded as a top intellectual and a brilliant banker, made a surprising retirement.
A few months later we got a sense of why he had left.
The bank division had burst with sub-prime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and put a cross on it.
It has indeed found investors, but they would have frowned on it not long ago: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so overlooked that we never even heard its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce again billions in losses, and the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy, due to its investment mistakes, and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to have such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We have not been able to save UBS once again", says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first calamity, there followed the second.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to release data on the wealthy clientele, who had cheated the tax maybe with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
In this way, UBS has more or less published that it has helped to avoid tax evasion.
At the same time, it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors withdrew.
And the exodus of the money from the customers.
In a few months, the bank had lost credibility in its two main business areas: investment banking due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And as things got a little bit more calm, and as we thought, UBS would get away with it, this unfortunate story of securities dealers followed: one securities dealer blew 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still doesn't seem to work.
"The Adoboli case has shown that risk management has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure of this: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control of the risks".
However, it was exactly the prudent idea with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken up their position, that of becoming the custodian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world might well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasuries of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the solid image of the Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, and the rents for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's are found here among the traditional Swiss shops as well as those of Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have resided here, from the national bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We're going into the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer wants here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another been thrown off the market - or betrayed by the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all like all Swiss bankers he does business with both big banks.
UBS would have become far too big, he thinks - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet they have long since adapted to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons".
It was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks entered into a huge group agreement.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it kept growing.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of UBS had completed: one rich but lethargic bank with a strong focus on asset management in Zurich and one poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who is very good at models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with his banking education".
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall".
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the executives at which the head of the Wuffli Group always uttered the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
It commanded the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of banks at the time.
After all, UBS wanted to go all the way to the top.
He's already succeeded in some of these steps.
In the field of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The company advisers, who were responsible for this, pointed out, however, a weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "fixed income", there would be a huge difference compared with the largest banks.
UBS is alleged to have shortcomings in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure which almost cost it its life.
Thirsty for growth, it was both the bank itself and a management fund set up before it in subprime American investments that invested.
It has become a massive machine that packed and passed through the documents of value based on American mortgages - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking to go down for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was in flames, UBS bought there", says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when stopping the attempts proved to be harder than we thought.
Some positions at UBS have become ejectable and are now banking.
Whoever runs the big bank has a nearly impossible task.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to stop the investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment bank must be strongly atrophied, as is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a temporary basis when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has taken over the UBS business, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of the art of the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are questions that Axel Weber has certainly asked himself.
He has so far only said publicly that he and his wife are going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
I'll see you next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had no impact.
The depressed industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its seed.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were only half-filled, not half-empty, last week - but now the problems are once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Mostly the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The Dow Jones index's default values at the close of trading were down by about 0.6% to 12,078 points.
During the course of the trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax finished with a fall of 1.2% to 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and adjusted to the end of the recovery.
As reported by Eurostat, companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month.
US investors have expressed skepticism: "We are not an island, but rather a dependent one", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to recover from a recession any time soon, and there are other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe will be strong enough to do something to end the crisis", he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early to invest in bonds from European governments and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the winds and entered the American tech industry.

Smart crows spread to cities
In many places, the freckles are considered a "bird problem", but experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long since stopped being hunted in cities.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. Crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many communities residents are increasingly complaining about the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it was no longer possible to hunt down city crows.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
Alternatives in the Cities
Conservationists also base the problems of cities on the exodus of protected species: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, cultivation, and cutting down typical nesting trees made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 mating pairs in the Westfälischen Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the killing of crows in that region.
Critics found the trapping of birds in traps and their killing with clubs particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless", noted Werner Klöver, the city and landscape planner in Leer.
Destruction of nests with pressurized water or felling of trees often has unwanted consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide and they spread to other places".
Expulsion is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them".
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
A combination of the displacement of animals to a hostile conditioning and attractive offers to enable them to resettle elsewhere is conceivable.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "information signs instead of chainsaws" to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better endure a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence".
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascheberger-Bask-Educational Trail, road signs informing about the lives of these highly intelligent freaks.
This project has meanwhile been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other".
The intelligence and skill of animals is legendary: Freuls not only use tools to get a treat but they make their own tools as tools of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested the intelligence of birds in four ways.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock down a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they were determined to recognize that a stone must have a certain size and shape to bring the platform down.
In a second experiment, the cunning crows were then asked to solve a more complex problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
However, researchers had made pieces of wire available.
All four creatures made a hook with which they caught the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three out of four tricks are even successful from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo is taking Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks were not realized.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have all bought the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship qualifiers in Poland and have eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal strayed from Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0-0 draw, their fifth appearance in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the knockout stage by beating Montenegro 1-0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) was already a foregone conclusion.
Nothing was more heated in the 0-0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, with Ireland taking a 1-1 (1:0) lead over Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic with an 11 metre penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made two shortcuts for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had previously failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
Portugal had a good start at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo sent a 30-yard free throw into the net.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills as a long-range shooter and shot from a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who in the first half hour achieved nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the striker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the English championship leader of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding is the center of attention.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese player the yellow card (36th).
On the flip side, Stark conceded an 11-yard penalty on the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up hit four home runs and it all became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will be going to the European Championships for the fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world-class Czech goalkeeper who had already been shot down, again, the forward of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The purpose shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing the Zagreb football miracle during that time.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb couldn't go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink had to give up his place on the bench in the 2002 European Championship third round, the Croatians were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the European Championship final.
With 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Sel Incukan scored in the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, striker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't leave anything to burn.
Apart from Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga players Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team under coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken charge with a 4-0 win the first leg for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied for the visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defence prevent a possible goal from the first-scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and held the ball to the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly", CEO Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The number of employees will increase from around 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4000 of SAP's 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
The Commission also notes that the Chinese exporting producers have not been able to demonstrate that the Chinese exporting producers have been able to achieve the expected profitability of their exports.
SAP plans to increase its revenue by 2015 to EUR 20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded a revenue of almost 12.5 billion euros.
The current business management of the software supplier, which employs 55,000 people, has never been better.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities . . . ", said McDermott.
"Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information".
The mass slaughter of the individual
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", offers depth and generosity, and begins with a long list of characters that will warm your heart.
A tip to start with: rip this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any mention of an ambassador or discussion of strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might have been like", containing "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, to doctors, paramedics, and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some will lose limbs, some will go mad, some will lose their lives.
Their lives here are like church candles, and as some are extinguished, new ones are lit.
Peter Englund's book is a departure from traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that the First World War was merely a terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" is a skillful description of other war theaters - the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordite.
When cannon shots are heard far away, and you're a stay-at-home mom, do you stay or do you run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by speculation, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high-sea fleet.
Their stories are mostly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are best preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz".
"Switch coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He's pursuing alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked in sheep's fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins; wooden shoe soles".
It states that "837 permitted meat substitutes are registered in sausage production and 511 substituted coffees are found".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and says of war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sit in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretend that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there are no barbarians behind your stuffy, nailed shirt.
A British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he is in danger of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
"When you're resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience", he writes.
Unfortunately, it is more like "a man who is secretly strangled".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new forms of terror.
"Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition", writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the early-century bestiary: the articulate, ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-fitted clothes, who carries out his butchery while sitting behind a counter".
People act unexpectedly, you find as much basic behavior as heroism.
Peter Englund tells of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade of pus from gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to their eyes, resulting in lifelong blindness".
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task as a human being.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war "unleashed forces that were entirely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, and hatred of religion".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are at war with them.
The best books dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "Nothing New in the West" by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The ending of the book is the most overwhelming I've ever read in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he's come out of his book, grabbed that page with the list of people in it from your hands and burned it with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others who were informed from the start that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against department regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organised on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are getting better riot training - counter-terrorism measures that involve rapidly moving large numbers of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training session was Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
Orders to move around the park came "at the last minute", said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few police officers I know who were called were unaware that they were going to Zuccotti Park", the anonymous person said.
"The only people who know they're going to be there are the top of the police department hierarchy".
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14th, police tried to clear the park but were repelled by hundreds of protesters who were informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to the particularly criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were coming and going in the park during the day, like migrants, so one o'clock in the morning was a good time.
"It was best to do it when the park was the least crowded", he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with loudspeakers and spots gathered at Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to pack their things.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the chief of police, said the action was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was harshly restrained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the TV cameras trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the thick trash of protesters' business, including luggage, plastic lawns and leaf bags filled with clothes, sanitation department crews followed, cleaning up anything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took their seats near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people in the center of the camp clinged together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleanup operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disturbance and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, is the highest ranking officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of the detective department, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although present, "was not in charge of operations", Mr Browne said.
A second group of officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case an intervention was necessary.
Barricades were set up on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police widen the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most armed with shields, were even reported to have been seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen tearing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up stealing from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school help union is suing the city for layoffs.
The union, which represents hundreds of schoolchildren who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs, which will disproportionately impact schools that serve disadvantaged students.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, 37th District Council, in trying to get the layoffs reversed.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, among the city's lowest paid, lost their jobs on October 7, which union leaders described as political revenge for not allowing the city access to a worker-led health care fund that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The city authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, saying that the dismissal of school-aids was not specified in the budget.
Officials from the 37th District Council said they would file a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the defendant, and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off female workers, all of whom are black or of Hispanic descent, as are most of the school assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet been able to see the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet on the number of school layoffs in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While no layoffs are counted on Staten Island, and only a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 of Brownsville, and 46 in Districts 8 and 9 of the southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuits claim that "It is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget shortfall".
The budget for Public School 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that the head teachers of secondary schools may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term 'overreach' to describe the action, although 'overreach' more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed", and "not just for overstepping the mark".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats have finally reached agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyan people as they begin to rebuild their country", said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to reduce funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The American mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not sufficiently to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate may now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism".
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide the legislature as it did last June?
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the very latest draft of the new bill.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments passed, but they have tried.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to have been introduced to Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill being introduced in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the amendment for a balanced budget alone, and another handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who want to gold their CVs - a chance to boast that they are the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for a vote by the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (D-NY) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is being proposed forever, as is the amendment banning desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states oppose it.
As eager as the Members have been to put forward amendments, they are not as quick as they used to be.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace is slower than in the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But those amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Butchered but not beaten", says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the face in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on a Monday night television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said she wanted to get better first rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance on ABC's "20/20" alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show dealt with his difficult comeback following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise comeback in the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "pretty good".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired the day before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special tracked Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos shot by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen lying in his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A little lip movement.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
Videos shown by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: the Representative is seen singing along with the doctors the Cyndi Lauper tune "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'?"
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said she has no recollection of the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and first asked for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been many deaths", Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard". I was like,
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten".
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You just got slaughtered.
And you're gonna come out of it, recover, and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in the dressed-up ties stood up at his feet to cheer him on.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes", said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military official at the gala, who also included Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan", the senior military officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have developed between the military and an enthusiastic but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a price, some military officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to sustain us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits".
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
So most of the talk about compassion is done in the privacy of veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they've faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were interviewing him were subtly asking if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from combat.
"When you talk about the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions", recalls Colonel Cancian when speaking to his sons.
Part of the military's difficulties stem from America's indifference to war.
Victory is rarely celebrated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and seeing few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism the way we did in World War II", says retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces Increasing Pressure to crack down on Rapists
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction in rape cases.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman, first class, was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed she was raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008, and she was walking home from dinner with a friend at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, when she ran into a coworker carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call", says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas put aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she says.
"I must have followed my intuition".
Minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will await with anxiety the verdict of the court at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket - she will file several lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense's strategy, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be sued by active or non-duty soldiers for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel in active service.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the plaintiffs' military service", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women still do not have the right to officially go to war, this distinction is only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely exclusively male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in connecting with local women.
As a result, 150 women soldiers lost their lives in both wars - two-thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight. Three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them time off - a relatively common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they process claims for benefits for people who report having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were introduced to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, that number represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 percent of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumatic events.
In Lyman's case, she notified the military police of the rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She was given a "rape kit", and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, at a trial where she is questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator of the crime, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, so I started screaming outside the courtyard".
"I was put in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine"."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at Washington University School of Law.
However, he remarks, "I think they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, stands between them and a verdict.
I've always been critical of the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same benefits and deterrents that responsibility brings.
"The odds are very much against them... but it's important that they try", he adds.
Those things only change when the good guys are willing to fight.
If the trial doesn't go their way, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will round up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is a reform", she says.
Where until we die, either one of two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who admitted to a fatal madness in Norway in July that left 77 victims, was facing his first trial on Monday.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being so in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers are eager to learn more about these people.
But how can we find them?
It's easy, just log in to Facebook.
"We realised that it wasn't that hard to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe, and they targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to take a survey, asking questions about their education level, their attitudes toward violence, and their optimism about their own future.
By connecting with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are more likely to be men, young people and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens".
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all kinds of topics that touch on health issues and social trends, thanks to "likes", wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, the 'data supernova' is driving an explosion in search, increasing the number of research papers with the site's name in the title by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to conduct surveys on people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never let you in", says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information".
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues, young college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook were far more likely to be alcoholics than students who kept quiet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk about alcohol too often.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We know how to identify children at risk, who would otherwise not be recognized".
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team looked at statistics on love and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (through only available information - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not -- in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it's a whole other story online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the trades were only seen by their friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even without access to the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know the truth of a profile or a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two completely different things", says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen are still the best tools we can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and contact with people", he says.
"Social studies are supposed to be about the social side -- and the social side is not about a computer".
"Cold and Inhuman" - first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter when he first appeared at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars", he explained to a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As for the court's jurisdiction, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I acknowledge the facts but I plead not guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions".
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who had brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All of them attended the hearing in order to see the outcome of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman", a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but I personally made a little progress after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a large "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not alleviate the grief and confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not", said one relative of a victim.
"It would have been a lot easier".
7 lessons from the lost Steve Jobs interview at the movies this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by his technical genius and the invention of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in a recently found interview with Steve Jobs, which will be shown this week as the first part of a film in major markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer, identifying himself as a hippie but also being very meticulous and organized, as well as an improviser of business charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that makes them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which chronicles the birth of the computer, and he sat for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies disappeared in transport.
It wasn't until after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly edited video is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
At four different points during the interview, the answers come long after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, with the goal of providing a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs's perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the days of Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, there's a curiously prescient aspect to Lost Interview where Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good and bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous career reviews of Steve Jobs, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then applies them immediately.
Here's a quick recap of seven remarkable episodes from Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers have been the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'"
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused about how costs were recorded - often starting with a 'standard cost' assessed at face value and then adjusted with a 'variation' - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the feasibility of playing the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and make free long-distance phone calls.
The device has been the subject of much written about before, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We'd wrap the ball around different things about half a dozen times and you'd scream into the pay phone and it would come to you a minute later on the next pay phone", Jobs explains with a laugh.
"We were young, and through this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much either, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things, and it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell us about a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak devised: he telephoned the Vatican from the Blue Box in the middle of the night, impersonating Henry Kissinger and asking to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in a frenzy of laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's approach):
At the age of 12, while hunting for parts to make a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated".
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed".
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a stroke.
Early in his career, while moving to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
With only 30 days' credit, he had to take care of assembling and delivering the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he recalled the difficulties he faced developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a lot of arguments... people shouting at me that it would take me five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300].
And 90 days later, we had a mouse that we could make for 15 dollars and it was incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had foreseen how many industrial leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the kinds of people] who end up running the companies and product personnel are left out of decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual labor required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an outstanding product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made on personal taste, and it's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that humans have created, and trying to bring those things into the product you're creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We're always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
That's part of what makes the Macintosh so special. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dining with health law opponents as the court convenes
On the day that the Supreme Court is meeting behind closed doors to consider the political contentious issue of whether opposition to President Obama's health care law will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will be defending the case in the Supreme Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, as a monumental 5:30 argument is expected next March, and the outcome will likely be likely to destabilize the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is issued.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the health care bill.
The star guests at the dinner?
This is not new: both judges have been present at the Federalist Society's events for years.
And there's nothing that's against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue with Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related organizations and the like, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This ethical violation and superb disregard for the code contradicts statements by several judges that the court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drinking and dining and at a fund-raiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court".
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
And the conservatives are saying that it's Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first law challenges were brought to the level of the trial court.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had been too invested in law enforcement to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion in airliner orders
Emirates Airlines has ordered 50 Boeing 777s, two-aisle airliners, with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal estimated to be worth over $1 billion.
It is not unusual for a company to receive an order for 50 of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the sum of those 50 aircraft reaches a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is who Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft over the next 20 years, with a total value of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 biplanes.
It was the Dubai-based Emirates airline that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The total value of these six devices is over one billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These particular customers are of immense value".
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only can they afford these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - which is usually detrimental to airlines because it is their biggest expense - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would make money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk coverage", he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's dominance in the heavy-duty aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to encroach on competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it was postponing the debut of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is delaying its start-up to increase its momentum following customer demands for increased load capacity and range.
The shares of Boeing rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously defeated in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán in a violent election, and she said Monday that drug dealers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon reported on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... they seized the polling stations, they set up roadblocks... and they forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he's organizing his comeback, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only slightly from Calderon, who was leading the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently serving as governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug trafficking and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates dropped out of the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year".
The ESDC strongly urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term slowdown that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest growing economic powers in the world should "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside European leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe".
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them".
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing in Italy has risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the world economy is headed for recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that such bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would give greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and a drying-up of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans as they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less, to accept aid from Europe.
"One day they will discover that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it", he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in poorly run jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "risk of loss" because of the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "rescue plans" to protect themselves from an economic reversal and major capital outflows.
Pentagon's stern warnings about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stepped up pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the rallies of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called sequestering would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large reduction, applied in this way indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and would seriously undermine other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal".
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness".
The reductions could eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"While wartime financing of contingency accounts abroad is not directly affected by sequestering, the war effort would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in core budgets", Panetta warned.
"The contracting personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war".
"Wage-management staff would be cut, leading to late payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic squeezing on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequester on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power".
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It's not a consequence we can live with, and it's certainly not one we should impose on ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call for the Pentagon to be exempt from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself rose to the highest office in the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"This is a bullet-free brigade".
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries".
"Indeed, it invites to aggression".
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage globally; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A glance at recent headlines reveals just how pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy swapping sexual harassment allegations with several women, each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and shaken nations.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner was made to look like an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who has lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on school and college tests are endless.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students to make themselves look good on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception do we encounter?
Studies show that in any given day, you can hear anywhere from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of them are utter lies.
Another study found that strangers lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to shout, "I've got you", cheat detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, blush, or move.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to detect and hard to catch.
A trained lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the micro-facial expressions, the form of the question, and the response time.
I've spent several years reviewing the vast body of scientific results and ever-emerging knowledge about deception, and it's clear that cheating detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are adept at reading others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies while women tell more "other-centered" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you're perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
It's called "setting the benchmarks".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Watch your subject's posture, laughter, vocal quality.
You should know if someone is always moving his feet normally, so that you don't get unfairly accused when you see him moving his feet in the middle of the congregation.
Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal deceit.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceivers can immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or present a post-interview relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, be careful of your subject vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped through the cracks using the past while pretending his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distant language, such as "I did not have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
One may use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember correctly... as far as I know".
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding being victimized by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be derailed after the threat of late approval from the United States
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking anger from unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"This is a real way forward", says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny any political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a decision by the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle's violent outburst in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building terrified their little girl to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th of last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to get the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily rebuked the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door,'" says Roseanna Monk.
"I told him, 'I don't care what you say or think.'
She became furious and began using swear words - the word "and" in a loud voice...
She had a water bottle and started to spray me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' " the mother said.
LaBelle rushed to the mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and was held back by her entourage, who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives haven't returned our calls for comment.
The lawsuit asks for unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a children's cancer charity.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct", said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child".
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of the administration of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-proclaimed of change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's opportunities for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost-affected report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage to 582 million 835 hectares of crops, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate of the State during the first three quarters of the year an accelerated rise was observed, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Active Population, in the second quarter the rate is 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly in terms of actions carried out by public policy.
"What we're seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to a variety of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation passed in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it's not easy for them to work for it, to invest it and use it in something", he says.
Migration in detention
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise", he said.
Not serious
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the employed population in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's mismatch is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Provision.
The average monthly income of Sinalo workers was, until September, 5 352 pesos, well below the national average of 7 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Economy Secretariat. From January to June, the State FDI reached 630 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 million 143 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly recorded by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, the State Government requested in July at the Public Congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no benefit of indebtedness was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and especially the good progress already synchronized by this new Government team, let's hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year have held back the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which is not turning fast enough to generate an economic dynamism which allows for an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had", he said.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state is being channeled into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unleash the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he says.
Much to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas, in terms of economic development some progress has been made, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do", he said.
Convicted of possession of eight kilos of marijuana
A Novolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office has informed that the convicted small-time trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small dealer was driving a white pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack in the driver's seat, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated evidence was made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Criminal Law Enforcement Centre.
Debts to contributions to works
The social projects envisaged in programmes such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be completed or suffer serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programs have progressed so far, they are in a risky situation, as the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to contribute 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over they haven't given us anything, although since July they should have given us part of it", he says, "and we, to avoid delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year we, in order to have access to these programmes, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid", he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over, they have given us nothing".
The Court Endorses "Analogue Cutting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to bring about the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a statutory attribution reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions it envisages for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the ministers also decided to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards for the public administration to prepare for them.
"I also do not think that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate to run the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and it translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalisation which implies a public interest decision that has not only a technical dimension, "as it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompassing a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in any way invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, since it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote counting in Michoacán is being analysed
According to data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 74 minutes.
The possibility of "vote by vote" counting is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 74 minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution, its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the expiry of the legal deadline for this electoral process to take effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines set by the Official Gazette of the State Act, on the grounds that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", as he has no right to "sanction or challenge" them.
When asked about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting record and count in the file of the ballot box is not with the president of it; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received at all polling stations may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won the election and the candidate who came second in the poll is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total count may also be carried out if, at the end of the joint count, the difference between the presumed winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages which were partly counted shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the case in the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains.
After receiving the tribute alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with their relatives attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends had gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was honored at the Saltillo Institute of Technology by his former colleagues in the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the Bachelor of Science.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, he always said that to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said that the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considered him to be at the height of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and he took great care of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enroll at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, saying that he had even a hard time with trucks, but he still pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His last goodbye
The honourable Members of the Mexican Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés, were greeted with a farewell address by the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the State Government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of that department.
The remains of pilot Bacio Cortés, born in Saltillo, arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies found on Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found murdered with gunshot wounds to various parts of the body and with the coup de grâce, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place about a mile (1.5 km) down the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed by this place observed that in the property, whose fence is beige and brown the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, at about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt with straps.
At a distance of three feet there was the body of another individual in a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the in situ data, the three people were murdered in another location, because no in situ casings were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by an organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured at Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published reports, in a first incident on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of her liberty was rescued.
They confiscated three buildings and a cell phone, and they claimed to be members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
In another incident that occurred on November 12 at 06:00 AM, military personnel made a surveillance tour of Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
When they were arrested and searched, the military found a long gun, a magazine, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are believed to have been buried underground in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The picture is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy battled a political and financial crisis that pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore the confidence in Italy that has been damaged.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to act quickly, market instability has put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' group Confindustria, told the media after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result", Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a devastating new attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups, as well as youth and women's organisations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief lull at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italy's debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the new prime minister's success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should continue until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are held.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties make it difficult to try to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have played in more than 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 teams that both countries have called for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a large record of Class A inter-team games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful English Premier League clubs, maintain year-round intense activity in national league and cup championships and contests in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greatest record of the Spanish National Team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the brainwashed Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognised the week before by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke centre-forward Raúl González with 102.
Next to the century figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and next to Michael Umana are left-sided Júnior Díaz with 48 appearances and goal scorer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of it.
The fewest with more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are yet to start.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the top scorer with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to put on one of their best shows next Sunday at National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that it will be a dream come true for them too to perform in this country.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of their two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20th will make their only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for my vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it's exciting to bring our music there.
I'm asking you because there's a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely in the days before.
What is your message to your most devoted followers?
Thank you for sticking by us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica, so thank you for waiting so long, and we are sorry that it took so long to get to this concert.
Some people are already saying that his show is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it's set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to performing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, and for both of those things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, right next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the guys who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you were offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never been there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We're going to try to do the best show we can with a wide variety of songs, we're going to try to do two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never rehearse the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you've accomplished?
Yes, I would.
First of all, I don't think either of us ever imagined that we were going to form a great rock band, and the fact that we've been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We keep talking about our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very exciting.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be going to places in the world that we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't have gone better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a key part of the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this great group.
We're very close friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's unusual.
Occasionally, a group emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups emerge from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that has emerged.
It's also very strange that a group like yours has stayed together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt joined us 13 years ago, and only that's a lot longer than most bands normally last.
First, I believe we're all lucky to be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We're all close friends and thanks to that there are musical avenues that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew older, it became easier for us to find balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time touring because it's easy to get caught up in this game of big crowds and people who like your music.
If we remember that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really of interest to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until after Andy [Andrew Woods] died.
There was a lot of frustration that it was so short and the most important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce [Fairweather] and Greg [Gilmore] who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're excited to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the lyrics to Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
The first ones I remember were Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... and I was like, "What's going on?"
There's so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge going despite the fact that it's no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is behind this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that are described as very dark songs, even though these can sound a little bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think that if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, those things start to affect your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that you can be happy and even then you can make obscure music.
The following countries:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has undergone four operations and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that Fujimori does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has had four surgeries for tongue cancer, has lost 18 pounds, and other ailments, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people by an army annihilation squad that operated underground during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of various ministers and business leaders, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that prompted Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations by its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has had a treaty in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has been trying in recent years to speed up the implementation of the tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustached plumber is going 3D with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he's never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he'll fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores this month, was designed from the ground up to take advantage of the Nintendo 3DS mobile game, which allows you to play in three dimensions without glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses should work", said Nintendo's specialised press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this medium", as so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and smooth play.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray into three-dimensions also means the character returns to a mobile console, a feat that hasn't happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustached plumber must travel through hazardous mine platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I'm a player, I find new things in the moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playful".
Colom approves the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
The trial is now over, and Guatemala has to comply with the demands of the northern country, which has demanded that Portillo be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision respects the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he "did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had carried out all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive step after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former 2004-2004 proxy.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and re-opened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, the long century of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was marked yesterday at an event in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people with low education, unemployment, drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of leaders from entities and institutions who have been collaborating with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the midst of the election season, showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the great hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mr Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the present one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The President gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work it does", he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Rue Balmes were living through is over.
Twelve people left the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro-parties that despaired the neighbours, voluntarily at noon yesterday, by order of the court and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From this day on there will be access control", the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water supply, besides painting the walls and leaving behind all kinds of debris, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and left the tenants desperate.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied her business declined by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub said that the invaders were treating her unfairly, because they were selling the drinks for three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure establishment had to respond to neighbours' complaints about noise, while according to the owner, the problems were not caused by the clients of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The manager of the club explained that the problems were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the owner "forgave" her the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP of the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of communal life and civic life that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were robberies as well.
In this sense, he added, "impunity must be ended and the anti-social behaviour generated by property must be relentlessly dealt with".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m. the police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the appropriateness of the summons beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), the administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also included a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York City.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orientate on the north-south axis, otherwise up (mountain) - down (sea).
The designation of Collserola as a nature park is a favourable idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the case until the city council held a 16-man mega-competition in September for all the access gates to Collserola.
A door that reminds you of a park, no doubt.
That, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The question arises: Collserola - park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of reflecting on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected officials speak of when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves, agree.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green houses blocks was not carried out.
"We must start from the premise that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the title "Collserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urban planning, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
These dangers stem from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the 1980s, when the Forum area had its "swan song".
The first fear is the self-limitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
"To limit something means to establish the next step", that is, to overcome it.
"We must think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan Master Plan (MGP) ] can cause real disasters".
Modol, who is more specific, says that, by simplifying, the slope of the Collserola Valley "can be understood as a park, not Barcelona".
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Collserola Board of Trustees that "must not be lost", thanking the town hall for the opportunity it offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the very beginning".
He also believes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passageway for architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he says) that have to be created: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question giving the title of this piece is complex, because the basics of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: "We have called 16 cross-sectional competitions - he says - in the direction of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This is at least in this case, since he has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
In other words, a project so that one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city should ensure that the strip immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, a facility area which makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years in detention, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Red Casino grants him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in pre-trial detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Prosecutor's Office 3 Property Offender, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office officer denied the charges of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos; however, he only spent a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue his trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October a warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as the one related to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the gambling house representatives in exchange for allowing it to operate.
On Monday, the founder of the legal authority of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could be released in the next few hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office officer attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez as to whether the damage had been recovered and which of the gambling house's associates had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to divulge the name.
Under case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and no further claims can be made in relation to the trial against him, no compensation for damages will be demanded from him and no punishment will be imposed.
After the hearing of the founding legal authority of the gambling house, at 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Clerk of the Court, Jorge Yánez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify the judge's order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake, and seven others lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate the unit had various ground contact, blades made contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements necessary to transport the personnel.
He also said that investigations in the impact zone have not reported the appearance of any pieces on the ground.
"In one study it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structural.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The ground was inclined by seven to 30 degrees.
The Secretary has said that the priority is to get results as soon as possible, but the investigation may take a few months, or even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and that it was on a soft upward ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal cruiser operation at the time of impact", he said.
During the press conference, the TSC holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was conducted in accordance with visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for takeoff, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low-altitude nebula.
Routes selected:
It is likely that because of the foggy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude and more visibility area towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact was on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No sign of fire or explosion.
At the scene of the accident there is still no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the remains of the aircraft.
The latest investigation results indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contact.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, with the ground sloping from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it may have disintegrated along its journey.
The information provided seems to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search of an area larger than the encircled area around the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, supporting the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social Insurance is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents, called the 'Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity Protocol' which will allow for the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of the Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the public, whether eligible or not, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the underage tests are conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (East Mexico State) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
After reaching the target of 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Unidad Sportiva Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Unidad Sportiva Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the aim of this investigation was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is being celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of inherited diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants will be subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic (seeking to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported a 77 percent increase in obesity among boys and 47 percent among girls in just six years, and a dramatic increase in overweight", said the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indo-American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetic cause of obesity is the inability to burn excess energy (calories), which is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detection of whether they are overweight or obese.
He even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are told of each of the measures and changes in lifestyle they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV most of the day and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal meat paste wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the chassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals that the paved area were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 paving stones each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the oil paved area is adequate, the paving stones could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on casings, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield and, consequently, the formation of the casings.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a combination of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the paving stone its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the asphalt's strength on the streets is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible paving, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, which is made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the small stones that make up the bed, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well through the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, the chemical engineer thought, these would spread better.
"On top of the asphalt layer", he said, "you put a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the bearing layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and that the material from which it is made be maintained.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he says, as these affect the yield of the asphalt layer considerably.
When the soil gets wet, water is spread inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cuts.
In the process of forming a chassis, he says, the first thing that gets damaged is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System explained that vehicle load is another important factor for chassis formation and therefore the thickness of each pavement layer must always be related to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent chassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow the chassis to be repaired easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle is given her 14th Princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the ribbon that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Giral (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in every presentation has demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been voted in vain as Police Queen and Vogue's Best Facial Beauty, titles won by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess was the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer given by the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature quite a bit, I think it's a form of culture, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty profound book.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a very beautiful book called The Blood Fever.'"
This answer is not pleasant, firstly because of the term 'culturalising' and secondly because it does not explain in concrete terms how each book cited had marked her.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public voting for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on stage".
And we noticed that in his first bathing suit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades the night before the coronation.
Although she appeared confident at both shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the Magdalena and Atlántico representatives.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the RCN channel's "Como en casa" program, said that Melina's nomination as princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
Also, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"Just beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest she is already involved in projects", she explained.
There is also speculation that Valle sinned because of her buttocks and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose her as the 'Natural Beauty' candidate with the healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The queen coach Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina didn't have the best body, there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on her abdomen, which in fact hadn't been too well known to me, left her with stitches on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the candidate of Valle were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect".
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest is giving for the first time, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prediction came true last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was giving to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
True or not, the truth is that Melina is starting a year of reign today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person in Cali who identified Alfonso Cano's body
A Cali typing man has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, a Cali-based CTI fingerprint technician made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the FARC's supreme leader, "Alfonso Cano", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of 'availability' for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of forensic investigation for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the location where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation on alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla warfare, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the scene of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
With a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a scraper, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the fingerprints on the corpse with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the Footprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting assisted in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and confirmed the identity of the persons captured.
When caught, many criminals present false identity cards or do not have any documents.
We're taking their fingerprints and running them through the database.
The investigator related that in one case of theft he had to remove a portion of a house's wall, since in this spot the thief had reached for his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in various robberies", he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a man was found dead with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative may be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle was a match.
Even though that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint technician explained that "the fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a pick-up line or a tape is used to pick them up.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declinant database, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is as it is shown on the CSI television program.
Not everything that glitters is gold, and not everything you touch is necessarily a print.
It can, however, be used, if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
"Indignant" People Defy the Authorities in New York City
Hundreds of protesters were crowding out Zuccotti Square to camp.
Most of the people complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Occupy Wall Street members defied New York City authorities on Tuesday by attempting to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn, and by attempting to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were crowding in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to enter thanks to a court order allowing the 'indignados' to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were further stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will move to another location and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the 'indign' response to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park at the junction of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the exact number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the movement members and tried to intervene in their favor before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some protesters who had been displaced were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and even handing it over to the officers who were guarding the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing 'laws issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other property they used previously'.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation because the square was becoming "a place where people came not to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of the American workers than the interests of the American workers", the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "failing to respect freedom of expression".
Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they are not planning to hold "large actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special.
Alongside Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", first responder on "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet circulation of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, is seen dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in a manger that depicts Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently hosted a segment of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy himself.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Revives After the Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster for the country since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of fall, the data for the July-September period have finally turned the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% on an annualized basis.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the largest rate of increase since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment purchases to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decline in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus for the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficits to grow from scratch.
Japan's recovery is mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by higher expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the troubled forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of big tech groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed the weak performance between July and September on the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to be seated in the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is not letting down its guard.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator foreseeing the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the major powers are holding back.
The rate fell by four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The eurozone was even below the average, which is at the level of 100, falling by eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives won't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to get caught up in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday indicated that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days period set in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit", Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message from Samaras no cast doubt on his position: 'We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more.'
The Conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must release the 8 billion which Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum vote, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release the aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "a clear written commitment as soon as possible".
The spokesman for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's 'leading' place in this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a leading position in the world in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become the second largest donor in the world in the last two decades to this instrument of cooperation, the "essence" of which is that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened the 5th World Micro-credit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and "very especially in the one that aims to halve the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, at which the "poverty threshold" is set".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and undertakes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions initiated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "facing many challenges".
The Microfinance Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which to push forward "two basic objectives".
So, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families will rise above the poverty line in which they are now living.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty alleviation", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project earned him yesterday the title of "head of family" meeting in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
'Ethical imperative'
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this connection, it argued that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since this is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez considered that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on the basis of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded to whom all the doors are closed"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress, held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November, was a smooth one for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially envisaged in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes at the end of their speeches was given to Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, to Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European-minded Minister of Finance, leaving no room for doubt.
The key idea behind the Chancellor's motion is the slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less Europe but more Europe.
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The Chancellor said: "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage 'in order to give Europe a face'.
This is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree on this revolution quickly: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
The delegates also rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight each country on the European Central Bank's board of directors according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously be to strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor, anxious to calm the mood within her party, made many references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty, which were quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
The European Parliament has been asked to vote on the report by the German Chancellor, who has been a member of the European Parliament since the end of the year.
Except for the hollow ones.
He recalled that two centuries ago Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of austerity, but is no less portentous of a right-wing presidential campaign axis, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, in order to save money: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of leave on private sector employees before they take a break.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that may provoke anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And this would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: imposing on civil servants a day of absence without compensation in case of a work stoppage (they have no time off so far, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-tells the subject of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to work stoppages.
"The checks will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay back", Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of the work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, the Commission has been constantly monitoring and pursuing political offensives, most of which have been successful.
The French are no sicker than the rest of Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros in daily allowances were paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% was for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
That's 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
This is an average that hides certain discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off sick.
Another study, this time by the Health Insurance Agency, states that in 2010, 37% of sick stops were of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more likely to stop working than elsewhere.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absenteeism rate (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud is very small compared to undercover work.
The fraud is small.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term stops were 'unjustified or too long', or 37,050 cases.
For arrests of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of 'inappropriate or unjustified' cases out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases were "unjustified" out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
This figure is very small, for example, when compared with the number of people working in the dark.
According to Dominique Tian, a member of the UMP who wrote a report on the issue in June, this would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said in Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the 100 days given to his government of union would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment", said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the confidence vote debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-zone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro-zone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He said he was in favour of the deficit and debt reduction objectives and the fight against waste but opposed any policy which would impede economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, reports the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to discuss with their doctor the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for this.
That is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada came in 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss the subject of death".
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the wish of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of Canadians end up dying in hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate of deaths in the country, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach conclusions which run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalised or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in practice, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, more cases of such over-excesses are found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It is worth noting that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would ease the suffering of those at the end of life, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
As for those who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear, say the authors, when it comes to whether a patient should continue or stop being cared for.
In addition, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for training of health professionals on the duty to respect the refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", inter alia because it did not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide", says Mr Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But "in society", he says, "there are markers and constraints".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "manifestly pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls for President Assad to Leave the Presidency
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy" by the Syrian government
Syria is becoming more isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria under Bashar al-Assad intensified yesterday, as he, with the support of Russia, resisted and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have been killed.
"If Bashar cares about the interests of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of the Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year.
"Those who are not at peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking a harder and harder tone" in the face of the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two more civilians were killed "in heavy machine gun fire and shelling in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
However, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem told a news conference that the country was "turning towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly condemned the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he called a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not be defeated", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said was "paranoid".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis-resolution plan decided on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities affected by the protests and the release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis-resolution plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
The Italian
Monti asks for time at the markets and sacrifices from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time on the markets to train his team and implement a programme, which will include "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in talks with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and employers today.
He should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats from outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the appointed Council president.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In a "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its programme, he stressed, saying he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understanding".
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern re-emerged, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate should form a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government must last until 2013, when the next parliamentary elections will be held, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will win the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has pledged, once in office, to work urgently to ensure that Italy "re-acts as a major player" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, among other things, further austerity measures.
The Italian "patron of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the columnists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must invest 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran 's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in nuclear risk claimed Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by blasting.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He is alleged to have subsequently cooperated in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only was well versed in this technique but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his home country".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or not much, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, while the number of crimes against Catholics increased by 13%, the number of crimes against Jews decreased by 4%, and the overall number of anti-religious crimes and offenses increased by 14%.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628, with 47.3 percent of them motivated by racial differences and 20 percent by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses increase again", Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior member of the organization.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses", he added, saying that this could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in US federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform to look more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform, including allowing users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a bit more similar to Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more easily, live, the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages ("tweets") you follow and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to re-post someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, is now opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating in a series of "tweets" about the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's intrusive, and it's too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter feed", tweeted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
The budgetary "golden rule" is inscribed in the Constitution
The Social Democratic/Christian Democratic government in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" on the budget to reduce government deficits and thus avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
The Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision at a ministerial meeting, when Austria's public debt stood at 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were reduced by just one step, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year", argued the Christian Democrat Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following up on a request made at the Brussels summit of euro area countries on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then demanded that the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts be included in the constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The Austrian government's approach is similar to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a rule.
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring the public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
The strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was close to the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold heavily in yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, fuelled by purchases by investors who see it as a 'safe haven' in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign income earned by Japanese firms when they convert it into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, said Noda, who fears that the rising yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world's third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared with the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption hit by the disaster.
But the prime minister felt that the rising yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected until Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen ($47 billion), raising the cap on the amount it spends on purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen ($519 billion) to flood the market with liquidity.
The euro area:
The rates are going up, the stock markets are going down.
The risk of the debt crisis spreading is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 is down 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With renewed tensions on borrowing yields in the euro area's struggling states, stock markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains".
"Investors are nervous and overly aware of the risk of infection", says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking to Europe and trade will continue in a narrow fluctuation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area is punishing the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is at $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has receded after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, meeting in congress on Monday, passed a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and on Spanish bonds with the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the parties.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds reached a new historic high.
Looking forward to euro area growth
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the INSEE revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's actually the fourth most worrying issue for economists.
Germany, on the other hand, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., just as the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with from a short-term perspective or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is a healthy thing for an election to be an occasion to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy in them.
The debate will only be successful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, population change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge portion of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil fuels will have to be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic which has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, or for Switzerland, which is simply intending to build only the latest generation of power stations.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, meanwhile, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by resuming construction of a power plant that had been halted after the Three Mile Island accident.
The German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, but the reality is quite different.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, energy dependence aggravated by increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a jump in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth considering.
Europe's wind champion, it gets 30% of its electricity from it, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the intermittence of wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our consistent energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
This is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not oppose this energy in principle, as polls show.
We should recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industrial sector with 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs.
It is a strong exporter and it brings in a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and makes them very creative in non-localised jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the €6 billion a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years when the decline of its manufacturer is programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have a safety authority in France which exercises strict and transparent control over the existing power stations and the Flamanville site.
Our teams, which are renowned for their professionalism, are equally obsessed with safety.
In the last half century, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was operated under normal operating conditions and had no human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human mistakes caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who wish to build a power station, the halting of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to Areva and EDF's competitors by leaving them the free way to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overcrowding of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the number, compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights country".
More recently, the issue of administrative harassment of foreign students has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation of 23 May) declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It's that there's a pretty broad consensus on this between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, who explained that France "cannot accept all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both left and right.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity shown to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivia, saying that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electoral; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemize growth and harm jobs.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace domestic workers, especially the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national workers, mainly working in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9% in the long term.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average accounting for 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the public budget on average over his entire life.
At the beginning of his term, Mr Sarkozy wanted to go "with the teeth" to find the missing points of growth.
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, but we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it has experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be sufficient for democracy to triumph over its enemies once and for all if it exercised its right to vote, and to do so in the most direct way possible.
We have known since Napoleon the Little that this was a thought-provoking thing to do.
Universal suffrage, if it is the necessary condition for democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum has been a double-revealer in this respect: that of the need for a powerful return to politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought through to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organised as needed and in a dispersed order.
A whitewash for the absolute European monarch or a leap into the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to have a coup, but we want a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - you wouldn't know where to stop listing them - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bending to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole which is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to the people's sovereignty the control of the European project.
Because together, Europeans can reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless, of course, they lead to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
Well, that's one thing.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take a new step in the European construction.
To make the Republic in France, we had to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not do this.
That lesson still holds true.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make people from Europe.
Contactless smart cards are becoming more common
The world smart card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.) to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most successful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows for public transport payments or purchases to be made by simply approaching a card reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground for contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start-up was more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were deployed.
But the larger surfaces put the double plug.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes this year.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French banks have committed themselves to systematically providing contactless credit cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, managing director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: mobile phones.
Few devices today are equipped with the near field communication (NFC) technology essential for transaction.
"They were late".
"But they should finally see a real boost next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The GPCB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phones.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "gained certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation", he explained without further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has revealed some of the bridges.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Akmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Axis of terrorism
Analysis of past calls points to several callers based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has been staying for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Akmi and the sect.
"It's a step forward but we probably have to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives outside financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this "support" has been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its operational methods, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices more and more complex and similar to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened people of little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Hausa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly growing.
It is politicised and demands strict compliance with Sharia law while its activists wage a struggle against the godless central government.
The latter are first of all targeting churches, bars, government offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, nuanced.
The army is surrounding the city, we count 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
As AQIM has invaded Mali and Niger, as al-Shabab's Somali operatives operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all intelligence".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making a number of thunderous statements and abbreviations on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsupported - were chanted.
Mitt Romney, the top contender for the nomination from the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and charge them "for manipulating their currency", a prominent theme in an America angered by the migration of entire sectors of its industry to Asia.
He said that it was too bad that it would involve the outbreak of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost choked on an attitude that "flattened" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains unheard.
Like Reagan, we are not alone.
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The second-best candidate, entrepreneur Herman Cain, has an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes on Iran, says he's ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're a long way from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
They point out that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put some water in his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of its naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, its hesitancy in Libya, thus labelling it weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is pretty positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
From Iraq, it is wary of military interventions leading to entanglement.
And, by arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama is striking more right.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia via the Baltic Sea, has been put into operation.
It must supply the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, last Tuesday, with orchestra and a fine buffet, the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year via a first 1,224-km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania state.
A second pipeline is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And there is already talk of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction project looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, both countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close off its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But this is at the cost of a weakened energy Europe, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in fulfilling its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavy gas consumers and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically", said François Fillon, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives, who were in large numbers at the Lubmin gas arrivals.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of steel with concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the seabed, at an average of 200 metres.
The construction of the new building was to avoid the World War II minefields.
"About 100 had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect wildlife have also been increased.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, and nothing interrupts it along its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project was abandoned as the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coast.
"In the event of a breakdown, we stop the gas flowing in less than a minute", explains Jens Müller.
If the gas leaks, the gas in the pipeline leaks into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to leak every 100,000 years.
The status of the pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, towed by a ship, for outside observation, and by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar and is inserted into the tube, which is one meter wide and is pushed by the gas.
When it arrives, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it delivers precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without any repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each) joined them.
These five companies have set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for a renewable period of 20 years, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For example, the investment for GDF Suez amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to get their money's worth, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
The gas is released through a four-and-a-half-meter-high valve.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and by 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name notebook.
Created some 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine aims to restore the taste for writing.
It smells like adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white-colored leaves, as if aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is based on an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million units.
We are far from the secret production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, since the notebook appeals to businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, has grown to almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the city centre and has managed to impose her identity.
"We have followed the tide of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a wide range of media.
A success that made people envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week for disabled employment opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging ?
"No", says Eric Blanchet, executive director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for employment for the disabled.
"The progress made in the last 15 years is remarkable".
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as it is now, but three times as high".
"There is still a lot of work to be done".
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, there are still many obstacles to access to employment.
They are rather elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all these criteria make it particularly difficult to return to work, and "are the root of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, managing director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
It is not to be said that the mentality is changing, but too slowly.
A survey carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, with mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the 6% employment target of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director-general of the Agence de la Fédération des Finances Internationales (Agefiph), the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The number of 'taxed' establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a lot of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "How happy are you"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they are getting from this friendly match.
It is not even written that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his striker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to say about him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to move on", says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances at club and national team, "it's a whole, he justified himself".
"In Lille I am there all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"I have to get my marks".
Scheduled for Friday night's match against Romania and France, Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis to finally shine.
But not without the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he's been cheering them on since he was seven and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been tolerant", he says.
This will certainly help to reinforce the "private" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just ran into each other".
"To be able to play against them, it's just happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, has spoken of "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala game".
"Proud" also to see - as a "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team again" a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job", he said, excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blues heading... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll find out in the next few games", including the one against France.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal is starting with much optimism its relegation play-off against Bosnia at 22:00 on Tuesday in Lisbon.
At first, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already doing it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Selecçao, which he has been in charge of since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there is one game to play, and one opponent, Bosnia, to beat.
After the 0-0 draw on Friday in Zenica, it's clear that the games are not over.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, but they were unable to score the valuable goal that would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but there's a risk because we didn't score on the outside".
But at home, in their bright Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even though the game is obviously "very tight", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a bit risky because we didn't score outside", Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think".
Good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
