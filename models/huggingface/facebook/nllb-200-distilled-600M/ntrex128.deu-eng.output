Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some Members of the National Assembly are appalled by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of all political parties fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly said his group was concerned that the name reamed with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: twp stands for doof and pwp for Aa.
A member of the National Assembly for the Plaid Cymru party stated that the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in Yorkshire-speaking English.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on the name changes, said: The final decision on the names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the National Assembly to change its name.
In June the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which resulted in broad support for the name Welsh Parliament for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of members of the National Assembly, the panel preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while the option of MWP was the most popular in a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to be proposing alternative options, but the push for consensus could be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is due to present a bill within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on disqualifying members of the National Assembly and on the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote on their names definitively in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with a similar name, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim to Greek territory is being raised, and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
Today, there are no more.
He said the bar disappearance was understandable.
People's social lives look different today, he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people regularly meet.
He fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders believe and that they will "sooner or later get back to square one".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with private homes where people do not support the remaining shelters.
The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white, he said,and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these properties will become members of these churches
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that held worship services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July used other words: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors drawn in, partly by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the bishopric.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns to the diocese in July that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the parish council, although it had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-old diving for lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, official reports say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was glad to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
When Hammel reached the boy, he found that his entire clavicle had been torn.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
For security and investigation, officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking cosmetics departments that look like department stores, staffed with specialized assistants, boats, super drugs and debenhams.
As part of a major push to the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales are falling, the larger cosmetics units will be tested at 11 locations nationwide and, if successful, will be expanded to other locations next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the supermarket's search for ways to reuse previously used retail space for televisions, microwave appliances and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, for the first time, the size of its cosmetics range has doubled to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series also receive more space and brands similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also launching a relaunch of its make-up series Boutique, making the majority of the products vegan-friendly  an aspect increasingly sought by younger customers.
In addition, fragrance shop will test out two Sainsbury's branch outlets, the first in Croydon, south London, last week, and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food every day in local grocery stores mean supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, retail outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos retail outlets and a number of Habitat retail outlets since it bought Argos and Habitat two years ago, increasing food sales and profitability from acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's supermarket branches.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-specialty pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in that an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy will be added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We've re-engineered the look of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brands are tailored to suit all needs, and because of the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the way we shop.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal.
Dragons Star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two of them's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her own new affiliate contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly "angry" when the television star, Golden Girl, admitted during a tense meeting at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she could not really devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessories brand due to her new business of up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his vacation homes.
One source said Holly was by far the highest priority for Truly.
It should secure their long-term future for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market launch.
In the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.
Experts believe the withdrawal of the "This Morning" host, one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his business affairs".
♪ Hard words ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider "unpresidential" and for such positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news anchor:
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as Trump hailed the first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on denuclearization have, however, stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding" US response to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States was imposing sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
He said we are very successful with North Korea.
We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have shown positive results: ending missile tests, supporting the release of hostages and returning the remains of dead American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so this is a bit difficult, Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu based on whether international bodies should participate in the relief efforts.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural violence.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu despite a warning issued is likely to have contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge, at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days' time.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the damaged Indonesian infrastructure a core part of his election campaign and has spent ample money on roads and railways.
The government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding shortfalls.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes and homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge is hitting a deep-seated tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a penalty kick in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge was awarded a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri, who was about 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal, with a 0:1 lead.
He aimed the ball left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the edge coming and I had contact with the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a 25th-minute hit by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker gave Mateo a pass with his heel back, then turned around near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the middle.
Then he shot a good steep pass, which put Hazard in the penalty box.
Hazard left the defenders behind and hit Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a left-handed shot through the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face off against the United in the UEFA Europa League video game on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster protection authority said on Sunday morning.
Many people are believed to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed as a result of Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered waves up to six metres high, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are urging residents to report if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early stage, but I would like to ask anyone who has stopped by John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask all persons, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police said they're in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, tearfully dissolved.
She keeps saying, "This is so terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the blockade and another vehicle was outside the blockade.
Within the blockade were several police officers who were monitoring the apartment block.
Those with information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to log 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of controversy over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-reminiscent destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artworks by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "dirty" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The image storm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historical narrative of a figure that many still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps in the late 19th century, more than he is today, to be someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, whose surname was only Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery streamed with blood near a pig barn in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his nose.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bit the farmers to death.
My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated, the cousin, who was given the surname Wu, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent further attacks on people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuans' family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While pigs rarely attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 200-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "triggers".
They're just playing games.
They like to wander and are very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
He said that they should only be treated with the right respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding-inducing rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern coastal time on Sunday, Rosa posted winds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trout is beginning to form over the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is being transported northward into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture will interact with the rising dew to produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Local 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding, floating debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity gradually leads to rainfall rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to reach between five and 10 centimeters.
The dispersion of tropical rainfall is likely to lead to flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the imminent tropical rain, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become rippling streams, and local storms can cause gusty winds and winds that carry dust.
The approaching storm is bringing local heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of over one centimetre is possible, which can lead to small amounts of floating debris and smooth tracks.
This would be the first rainy season in this region.
The first individual tropical showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with heavy rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will continue through Wednesday.
In October, the United States will see a sharp temperature fluctuation as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes results in drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 12°C.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat is trying to develop and expand.
For much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start of October is expected, with temperatures reaching 27°C from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about six degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people have watched the audition for Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday watched the compelling statements by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation was still in a state of disarray, and on Friday, television stations suspended their regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement negotiated by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, pressured her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this hadn't happened.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers Nielsen reported saw the hearing.
The company established average viewership figures for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring office viewership.
To put this in perspective, this is about the same as the number of spectators at a play-off or Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest number of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters loudly pressured him in the elevator on the way to a hearing by the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there for minutes with his eyes down while he was being shot.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you believe he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power, while so many women are powerless", said one woman.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say in the committee hearing.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI, as requested by the Democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake was persuaded, in part, by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the nation's interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her published on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual imposition of tariffs by the UK and the EU totally absurd.
Deadly Shots to Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
The agency released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson, which police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS affiliate WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the crime scene, saying that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After Simpson was interviewed, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting at Wayde.
The lawyer reports that bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police's Criminal Engineering Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for its care and its pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" by Wayde's death and "shocked".
"You're always afraid of something like that", Wade said.
Volcano is spewing ash on Mexico City.
Ash thrown from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of groaning and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by the police preparedness threw eggs at them and also sprayed paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets normally crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there were also clashes with the police, who used their batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted 'No forgetting, no forgiveness' as unionists opposed them, calling for 'Long live Spain'.
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The electorate had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, as the opposition to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes outside the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they had the choice, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite a major, if narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia have had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting their proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
He said the situation was becoming more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament election.
To run for the European elections is the best way to promote the degradation of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government, he said.
London: Men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30pm British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Also, it's possible that the car was shot with a chest arm.
Menga 's hit means a 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston .
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to only the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas's hit proved crucial to Gary Holt's team's second half tie with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team will remain undefeated in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts eight points behind on Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers were hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston can increase his winning streak to six games in the division meanwhile, meaning head coach Holt hasn't lost since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against openly gay guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness posed the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down before the goal, and Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This was the decisive gate.
The Rangers gave up a free throw, and Livingston provided a chance, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in shooting position together.
During this period, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but the hosts' defense failed to overcome, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely uninterrupted.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was dismissed with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanken was repeatedly brought into Livingston's penitentiary and regularly removed from the danger zone, while two demanded penalty kicks were denied  one by Halkett against the altered Glenn Middleton and one by hand-playing .
Fenomena  by Livingston  Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and exceeded expectations again in this upward trend.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he's been shaking the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the trail throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient  only once they were able to penetrate the hosts' squad , and that's kind of like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receiving mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiling faces and blue skies prevailed as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to help repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters flocked to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made a statement condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his immediate family.
Roadblocks and bus routes have been set up and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots at a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 am on Sunday, British Summer Time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continue.
Specialised Tornado officials were recruited to put an end to the riots involving eight inmates and confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were deployed to correct an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and may spend longer in jail.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated at the hospital after being attacked by a convict.
In October last year, security officials were called to the prison to fight violent riots in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the deserted southwest, bringing with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach in rain on Monday night and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have come within 200 miles of Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall with occasional up to 15 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely and up to 10 centimetres in total are possible in some cases.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with rose can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona has at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will continue to have hurricane strength, with maximum winds of 135 miles per hour (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then move north at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken.
So Rosa is expected to hit land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, and there is a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonoran Desert, rainfall is expected to be between 7.5 and 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres, reported weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move upward through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The main threat to Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest Sonoran Desert and the deserted southwest of the United States, the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these rains, life-threatening flooding and waterborne debris are expected in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured at around 4:00 a.m. local time Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is stable.
According to Avon and Somerset Police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone with a record of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered under the ugliness, the wrath of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and unheard of tactics of the Democrats", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered from the demons' outrage and outrage throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, dismissing the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in public service", he told his crowd in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am actually running, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as "resisting and blocking".
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, death toll rising
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of them inundated when huge waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when, at dusk, waves up to six metres high hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people were still on the beach, not running away immediately, and they fell victim to it, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster protection agency BNPB, at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it flooded cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the Disaster Management Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, and a water-surrounded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay could have made the tsunami bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse, the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was repeatedly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official figures.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting to people on the street below him warning of the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall is building up on the shore, flooding buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, disrupting communication around Palu and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending freighter jets with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need urgently food and other vital goods.
The city's airport will remain closed until October and has only reopened for aid.
A visit by President Joko Widodo was planned for Sunday to evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but Dosebas said they passed the scene of the devastation on the way.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as aid groups began to work hard to get disaster relief started, some felt that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
At the moment, it is still a provincial disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says okay, this is a national disaster, we can accept international support.
As the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday descended over Palu, friends and family of the missing were hoping for one of the miracles that would shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescue a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa Hotel's collapse broke under the umbrella, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were attending the beach party.
But his messages, instead of being blue hooks, only grey question marks.
I think that means the news hasn't been delivered, he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release from Newport Police, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to pay more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, a man ran after the Brink's employee and stole a bag full of money that was meant for the vending machines.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information identifying the suspects is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The being formally known as Kanye West (The being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He is a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled the show for "emotional reasons", according to the producer.
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious significance for the West.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du, West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "the only one", just became "Ye" a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, the guy West worked with before, has written his name with and without a hyphen and a capital letter.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student grants and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities were driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Given China's increased efforts in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research spending on this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various branches of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 AI innovation country by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the US.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI success coming to the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked when the next competition would be, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
It's not China that takes away the academic leaders, but the companies, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired coryphenes from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee believes that a modified US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
I think that AI PhDs should be automatically offered green cards, he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its plan for the development of next generation artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been unchanged for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims Greek territory.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is questioning whether voter turnout will reach the required 50 percent for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said they would abide by the result so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters had cast their ballots.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, will vote in a referendum on the change of the country's name on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and put chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upper echelons, not through the back entrance, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will support this, as more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvering through the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero made his 65th minute hit look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty box.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty box to return the ball to Aguero, who overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
It's happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League duel.
That goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on that train far from Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker hit the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game for the Rockies .
Since the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force another bet.
The always-performing punter hopes to be on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, however, but only if that's relevant to the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the playoffs.
The Rockies have at least one wild card win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to secure their first division title.
Although we're not playing for anything, we can at least throw, because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I'd ever meet this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they are reportedly prone to have jokes thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th stint as a starter, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal day off.
The Washington right-hander has a record of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53, and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who was elected to the Supreme Court by him, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones, I'm not running, but I'm running, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the ugliness, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them.
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as "resistance and blockage".
And you see that in the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.
He named the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused a loud outcry among the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you. That was really bad body language.
Labour is no longer giving all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who speak their mind.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, it came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome  just because we say our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she had been active in her opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized on the indictment for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, on similar issues, which Jeremy did not agree with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'the meetings should be all-inclusive and productive'.
Most Friday night GC meetings were just that in my eight years as a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendlier, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader.Colleagues with whom I had previously believed I shared similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions I would have never agreed with otherwise  whether it was on national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  and it doesn't matter what I say , there's a smear campaign on social media calling for my election, denouncing the political centre and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with that experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments they make to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that insults have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer allow all opinions to be held, and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes closer.
I have been advised many times in the last two years to close my mind and not express my opinion so clearly, so that I would have no problems.
But that's not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally broke my classroom apart in the whole school, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, as a city councilman and as a cabinet minister.
I never made a cover from my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way confused about my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday's call, I just want to say this: given the fact that the country is on the verge of a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I'm not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that so many other election threats or political purposes won't stop me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: undefeated Ayr team tops
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams undefeated at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better exploitation of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Acknowledgement for Ayr, they've taken their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot took a non-increased attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a hit straight into the half and then scoring a single extra try, leaving Ayr at 17:5 at halftime.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, augmented by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Following a prolonged suspension due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field, Ayr extended his lead after a Climo-up attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again at the end of a period of enormous pressure Melrose had the extra man pay off through a non-enhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty spot behind the advancing Ayr pack.
Climo increased as it has since almost the break after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to switch to the hospitality industry after he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose script he writes, and in which he plays one of the lead roles alongside his longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz, decorated with watercolors.
A sea blue flag is blowing on public buildings.
The motto of the fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: "The sea is our rightful possession.
To recover it is a duty.
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the 19th-century Chilean coastline lost in a bloody resource conflict is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the outcome with a positive attitude, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the ICC's ruling on the big screen, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim, which means that after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is also at stake in Monday's ruling.
We are about to return to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely and that this would change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorised to address Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice has been in force for six months after the final hearing suggests that Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, concluded that the case was not complicated.
The last four years, far from supporting the Bolivian case, could also be a setback.
The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric had suffocated any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually quick.
He said that on Monday Bolivia had an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to the 139-year-old dispute to mutual advantage.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  is using the sea issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific, he added.
The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament can only happen if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never first disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming the stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as a brainstorming idea.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collections of giant headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection on the runway, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations down the aisle.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant, beige hat with a feathery wide edge that almost squeezed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with tight lips and had more in common with Hannibal Lecter than with haute couture.
One creature resembled a diving kit, including snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice pack.
And if you want to put in another huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on La Bomba, the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski all wear.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that hit the big waves on social media sent another big creation over the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The red orange bag with a white leather heel was the highlight of Jacquemus's 2019 Summer Collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has attracted so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hardly to ignore".
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland continue to excel academically, with further outstanding results in 2018, and are only supported by individual and joint achievements in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils from across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of care for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year's examinations show that the languages with the highest grades are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A's on their higher examinations.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of Mandarin students scored A on their higher examinations, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered electives as well as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and other bodies.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems with job openings were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That's why it's important for today's children that we invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, all schools have different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages that are considered the most important for the UK in 2020 will be taught, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from with appropriate specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares and equipps children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may look like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before the Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego .
For fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the preseason opener.
But how many minutes he'll play is not yet known.
It's going to be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself at this stage of my career", he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, including in his favorite places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on confirmation of his Supreme Court vacancy, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans risk losing control of Congress.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation will remain pending for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main goal of this rally is to support Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
President Trump's campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to mobilize "volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House.
Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season draws near, a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and report to media outlets in Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to back the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show willingness to fight to keep hope for the singles on Sunday
After three one-way rounds, the fourth game on Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so I think that's a little momentum for us", Jordan Spieth said as he left the pitch.
Europe is obviously ahead by four points, followed by 12 points.
But according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can score three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the ground up to the green and is leading by example.
The good-natured shouts of enthusiasm were raised further along his lap as he sank an important pitch to decide the fourth four-point game for both of them after he and Thomas had fallen behind two holes with two points.
His bitch who decided the match for them on the 15th hole triggered a similar scream that suggests the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to get down on my knees and take care of my own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for the individual players.
18 holes to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and without a doubt, they have made the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four points out of four and can do nothing wrong.
Moliwood wasn't the only couple who didn't hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly interlocking energy between them and the mass of energy that is being released confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But it would be too early to talk about European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning's Four Hero, who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a strait they could not overcome.
But on Sunday, no one can help them out.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look at up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a flash rate.
The Europeans have been playing better as a team so far, and they have a clear lead on the last day, but this fourth round has also shown that the US team is ready for battle, something that some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is ahead of the USA 10:6 after Saturday's quarter-finals and quarter-finals, and is leading solidly into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went on to beat Tiger Woods in two defeats and thus score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who are looking to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the morning's fours against the mistaken American team and won the series 3-1.
In the fourth round, the United States showed more resistance and won two games, but failed to catch up.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the 12 individual games played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were named after a sensational weekend, became only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their four opening games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmonized perfectly and beat the enchanted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged through two games on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning four, returned and played the four matches as Henrik Stenson's partner, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and number three in the world.
But for Europe, on that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris, not everything was as they had hoped.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They scored a hard 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Fourth, and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the Fourth after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice has a team come back after going into the singles with a four-point gap, but as a title holder, a draw is enough for Fury's team to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, it doesn't look like they'll be able to launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general meeting that last year, North Korea took "goodwill" measures to stop nuclear and missile tests, degrade nuclear testing sites and commit to not proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
We do not see a corresponding reaction from the USA, he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be unilaterally disarmed first.
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-by-phase" denuclearization approach where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had assured him that he would work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump agreed to guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for a relaxation of the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even opposed to declaring the war to end, Ri said.
The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brainstorming of those who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: If South Korea had been the other party to the denuclearization issue instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this halt.
Yet the tone of Ris' speech was vastly different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would target the mainland US after the evil President Trump called Kim a suicide missile man.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time frame for it: Whether it takes two years, three years or five months  doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to finance Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making "common demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the appropriate measures sought were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough sleep in a class
A new course at Harvard University is ensuring that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure of the widespread macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading universities often are unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came to me and asked, Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was.
This year's first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books, and receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
Then, using a map of the campus with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this  just as you have a right to know how your decision to smoke affects your health, Professor Czeisler added.
The pride in pushing a night shift is still common, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
He said that to ensure sufficient sleep, the secret weapon of all students should be stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and that weight gain could be avoided because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped design the course for Professor Czeisler, who had taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a college-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be for all postgraduate students to be asked to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should set up a wake-up time for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can cause circadian rhythm to go off the rails, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston to Rangers 1:0: Menga-goal forced Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit meant a 0-1 loss to Livingston for Steven Gerrard's uneven-playing team.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first outdoor win since the 4:1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who led by a distance in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the poor-inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of a draw.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third place, only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also facing further trouble after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object that was apparently thrown from the guest's block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same 11 Livingston players who gave the Hearts a point last week, and he must have been thrilled with how his well-trained team kept their opponents on a step-by-step basis.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes when Mengas first pass Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot on the side.
Then a long free throw from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only pass by the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game looked more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have been sentenced after a quarter of an hour because of a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only get two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute hit may not have been the same as the game, there's no denying that they earned it for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a ball that Jacobs shot long in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in midfield and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the change took effect almost immediately as the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play the exact game they deserved, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final stage, but McGregor held out well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow dropped a headball out of the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also called for a late penalty kick after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a standard feature of science, has also become a standard feature of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
Evans: In fact, I hear a bang!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see deformed cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerate cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can see a common protein in many cancers and then inject again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize deformed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory to allow them to see the common protein HER2  of many cancers, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West left a pro-Trump tirade after his performance on SNL and wore a MAGA cap (Make America Great Again).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he flattered US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he continued with a slanderous gunshot to the Democrats, again emphasizing his support for Trump.
I'm often asked by white people, How can you like Trump?
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual harassment allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Shame Day was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West's release.
West also complained to the audience that he had been having trouble behind the stage because of his head covering.
They harassed me on stage.
You said don't go out with your hat on.
You harassed me!
And then they say I was in a sunken area, he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he was going to draw my Supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments sparked at least two public outcry, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported.
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It" in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds:
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just himself and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I do not want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, adopts an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art).
He's free.
The same applies to us., she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now The being formally known as Kanye West (the entity officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in connection with stabbing at Belfaster Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in Belfast's arbitration court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewing the allegations.
Game of Thronesstar Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow swinging sword in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of superheroes, saying that such roles on screen would cause boys to often feel they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31, who also stars in Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was "very important" to him.
I personally find the question very important at the moment, what went wrong with masculinity, he said.
What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for the increasingly toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes a boy feel that he has to embody that particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because there's clearly something wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that after the series ends next summer, he will not be participating in any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones.
From November, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so this is how I got my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow.

HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is widely reported.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are due to insufficient protection from sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senators' data, criticizes dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
Maxine Waters, a U.S. House of Representatives member, denied on Saturday claims that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims of "ultra-legal" experts and websites would be circulated.
Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was leaked online Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The release was made after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was assigned to Waters office, and published the information of a member of Waters staff, The Hill reported.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie, Waters continued.
The member of my staff  whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations  was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"This dementia is furious", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
People accused of something they didn't do shouldn't be angry.
You mustn't be defiant.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You must be calm and calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of infuriating him during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true", he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued,and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Johnny English You only live three times   Weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English The Spy Who Stopped It and was revived stunningly in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will an ironic self-parody of how obviously stupid we are become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the licence of the sloppy, grim-haired, incompetent Johnny English to screw up has been renewed for a second time, and his name more than anything else signals that he is a general comic creation for movie goers in non-English speaking areas.
Of course, he's the cranky secret agent who strangely thinks he's cool and worldly, when in reality he's made up of something like clouseau, a Mr. Bean award, and a bang from this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents, who Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's last adventure has a couple of nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade was attached to his helmet.
Atkins's talent for physical comedy is apparent, but the humor seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because even the serious film series like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more about children than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as imaginative and focused as Atkins's silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The eternal premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on duty, much to the displeasure of the agent on duty, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a bloated and depressed figure who is already facing a complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this almost Teresa May character, but the script doesn't give her much to work with
Her intelligence advisers tell her that all active spies have been exposed and she must recruit someone to retire.
This includes the cool Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy institution, but unofficially teaches undercover as an undercover agent, and there are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy that reminds me of the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a boring woman of higher society whose role is somewhat wasted on Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who always make terrible mistakes in your Majesty's intelligence service, are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful wife, Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque fun: dressed as waiters, they set a fancy French restaurant on fire, they create chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas' luxury yacht, and English tries to unleash pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Voltas' house using a virtual reality headset.
This last sequence will draw all the logs, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the subject is already being discussed in detail on children's television.
It's a fairly moderate material.
Like the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?"
Labour denies working on a plan that would make the British work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party is reportedly seeking to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution to employees in the form of an additional day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
According to sources, the idea is appropriate to the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "An audit of the policies is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day workweek is an endeavour consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of workers and the Party's general industrial policy strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party, however, is not currently generally in favour of this approach.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made clear at the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profits" in public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their full share back as a Labour government could make deductions due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed the plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private company equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are commenting on the news magazine 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about it than his colleague from South Carolina.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I told the court that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, that statement was made, and I asked if he had.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be cut into stone.
"I'm pretty sure about Brett Kavanaugh, and he said a bomb should go off".
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied this, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all who called her could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
And I can't see any changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty in this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is taking place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the seventh time this year, not only to see the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communicating with a leading global politician (by email or phone) or similar actions to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of putting on a cool free concert a sensible way to convince others that it's time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism  if you think you can make a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen reported that the project has seen more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are expected to have helped inspire leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Group also noted that the Commission's decision to initiate the investigation was based on the fact that the Commission had not yet established a specific objective.
The group estimates that the funds secured have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development and pledged to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
And in response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, which is, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
And they said, "It will be a long and difficult journey, with highs and lows.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York City, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy to blockade Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examine, Washington can use the Navy if needed to prevent energy from Russia from reaching markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia's deployment in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently acting at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
I think the real reason for Russia's deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe, he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that sea lanes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a nonprofit group that sees itself as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia, he said, while describing Russia as a One Trick Pony with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for Europe's consumers.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into "captive" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counter-wind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply, says BDI Executive Director Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to look into a 2020 presidential candidate, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that she would be examining a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine a presidential candidate after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy", she said.
Warren has not taken the piss out of her criticism of Donald Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation would be required before the vote.
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for office in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential Massachusetts voters said the senator should not campaign.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent opposing it.
Other prominent Democrats who are in contention for a 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder, which is the path Palin is suffering from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be shared with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they come back changed, that they come back more slowly, that they come back and wonder if there's that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military has given to the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support a new asylum policy appeal
18 states and the District of Columbia support a new U.S. policy to deny asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a court expert statement Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is questioning policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner and his violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are seeking asylum in the United States, as nations facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's attorney general, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels".
Federal law provides that all asylum applications are to be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that court violates this principle, the court expert statement stated.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the country is having a negative impact on the US economy because immigrants could be more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is available to all those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief, Sessions said in his policy announcement of 11 June.
It was never intended to degrade all problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It's all very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while calming her fever-prone little son in a rescue center in the devastated downtown of Palu.
Every minute, a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to gather their wet possessions and store up whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
Everything went way too fast.
I think I was stuck under the walls that were built, he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
I heard my wife's cries for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place.
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the provincial capital of Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid attachment of the China Daily in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling magazine, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to meddle in the US election coincide with a statement from US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign launched by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, who exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling down on this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is asserting the proven American tradition of free speech and independent press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing views at the newsstands here in Beijing and will not see any real reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese might have about China's worrying economic development given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers refused to accept the offer to publish his article, but did not name the paper.
Republicans are shocking voters ahead of midterm elections with the debate over Kavanaugh, observers warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault allegations, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections that could include women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they will continue with a vote.
"These things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in The Hill, told a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute breach was sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow and they won't forget November,  said Karine Jean-Pierre, first counselor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate lobby shouted "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer at the news site, told the BBC.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially for women in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, observers suggested that a backlash could be the result if Republicans claimed confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote or Kavanaugh's review; it's about the way the Republicans have handled it and treated them, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the Democratic vote, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share taking the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents were definitely or likely convinced of Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied about his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford made a swearing-in statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her when they were at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of creating a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it clear that the intent behind Inrupt was to "rule the world".
We need to get active now, he said of the startup theme.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate sectors.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide for himself who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal enhancement and development through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and related skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a number of developers who were hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely transform their entire business models overnight.
We do not ask for your permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee helped to redesign the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a key figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely confident about this new era of the web, he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honoured
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award for his service in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain's highest war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was symbolic because the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic deed.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with the greatest bravery before advancing with a field gun in solitary and extinguishing three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something he could never justify and at the same time something that humiliated you.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be able to attend the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero is seen primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom was not badly surprised when Peppa Pig suddenly appeared.
Some remained unaffected after waking up until the early hours of the morning to watch the battle.
One fan described the switch to the tricky movie character on Twitter as a kind of bad joke.
Due to a government regulation, this content is classified as non-youth-free and had to be changed to a children's show at 6pm, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa, the pig, exactly.
The Bellator CEO, Scott Coker, informed that the company will be revising the timetable to take into account UK viewers in the future.
I think the problem could be solved by the repetition game, he said.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday in the UK viewers' room, and we won't solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying on.
The changeover was a lot of communication, and it was a lot of mess and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical malfunction.
What wasn't the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're gonna reduce the whole thing to five fights instead of six, like we normally do, and we've tried to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is pretty unfortunate.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels down on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who competed in the Olympics as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he realized that he was different from everyone else only in secondary school.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, Olympic victories are no longer so important to him.
The long-time host of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking a break from acting for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, he said he used to consider himself inferior to others because love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others is the basis of my power and strength and ultimately my success".
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person, so that no one would be disappointed when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had spoken on this issue because he was happy to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wanted to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference was never an issue.
He says that when you had to go through so much as a child and teenager, when he first entered the Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son since June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes his whole outlook has changed since then.
Last year, he was the one who had everything to do with gold medals.
But for him, there's more to life than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main asset.
He shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the lead.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible", he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics", he said.
His first song selection, Heather Small's Proud, was also influenced by it.

Mickelson, who is not in form at the moment, is sitting on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work hard to keep this from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day encouraging others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that weighed on him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer, and thus not an ideal squad for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the venue itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson will meet in Game 9 on Sunday with the British Open's perfectionist champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a rookie at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in the 12 singles, and they're off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the world's most famous personalities and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it's been and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.
Mickelson will set the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup run that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time appearances, although Fury said his presence alone enriched the team.
He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to do some pinky stuff, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team, he explained.
I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week.
He's a really interesting person, giving a lot of impulses.
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows the lead may be over soon.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the final individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but barely crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning 141⁄2131⁄2 points.
The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that's just a short, Bjørn said (pictured in the photo) after seeing the Class of 2018 win 53 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow is going to be a good day.
Get on with it and do the right thing.
It's not over until the dots are on the dashboard.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where we're focused.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world.
Happy about the performance his players have achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: "I would never rush this.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, individual performance is the priority and that is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to the limits of your golfing skills.
You have to make it clear to the players that tomorrow you'll get the best out of yourself.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and he's got to make the best of it too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that his players perform better individually than in the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big twist on the final day of the tournament, on the winning side in Brookline before he stood on the losing side of the European Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to take off the fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the momentum is going in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle teams.
We'll set up our team accordingly and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we'll try to cast a spell tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of taking the counter-offensive, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything", Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, it will not be delivered until the following year.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time, which referred to a military spokesman.
The ship was to have been commissioned in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are to contain a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and naval missiles, and camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of marine life.
However, the continued delays may mean that the state-of-the-art warships that are meant to represent Germany as a naval power will be outdated by the time they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate, which was haunted by the disaster, made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship down and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the yard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant software and hardware errors that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the ship was much too heavy, which led to performance impairments and prevented the Navy from carrying out future rearmament measures.
The 7000 tonne Rheinland-Pfalz was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
The costs appear to have risen to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared with the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's deputy for defence, confirmed that the Navy was running out of operational vessels.
Bartels said that the problem grew larger over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be taken from the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
At a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as brown long-eared and water-footed bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations on the property to record the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile testing with portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' cries and determine which species are doing what.
A map and report of the habitat is then created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help to identify the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to conserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their nightly hunting habits.
They use sophisticated echo-setting to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, takes the bat issue very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out examinations, bed inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Wellness manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great bat area", he explains.
We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is much we do not know about bats yet, so we are doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.
It stresses the importance of first excluding bats from the holdings before maintenance work, as the unintentional destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know what their populations are like for many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers try to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people want to be famous for using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The forward of the Portugal and Juventus national team Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" just hours after they were published.
I'm not going to tell you.
What they reported today: Fake News, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
You want to make a name for yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine, the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror over allegations they described as "illegal reporting on privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded damages for moral damages equal to the severity of the breach, which is believed to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly entered the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was 99 percent a good guy who was down to 1 percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but says it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to dissolve the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed a €100 million deal with Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: the UK would regret the loss of carmakers forever
The UK would regret it forever if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should the UK leave the EU.
We need a deal, Clark says.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will see production at our plant stop, says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard exit from the EU without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the automakers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facility is run on a Just-in-Time basis, which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on-demand.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders that could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts, according to the industry.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock of more than one day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company explained, and therefore production had to be stopped.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is designed to avoid such border checks.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said, to not only enjoy the success we have now but also seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the supply chains that have been very successful so far.
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's top official at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's scheduled meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and a possible presidential obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the vice justice minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had sought the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and removing the president from office by means of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he entered the White House last Monday as new reports of his alleged resignation were released.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid collision with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "A date has not yet been set for it. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening with the Supreme Court right now.
But I like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
And host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not due to a dislike of the "effect joke" of TV reporters, but admitted: "I would not deny that they are making a joke".
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President is doing more question and answer rounds than any President before him, she said, without providing any specific evidence.
We are not going to be able to do this without the support of the Commission.
We try to do this often, and you've seen that we've done this often in recent weeks.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, perhaps the president showed why this is so when he made a bizarre and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU NHS staff about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health is addressing people from outside the EU who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express their country's gratitude and wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in the Scottish decentralised public service.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: Throughout the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the troubling times this must be for all of you.
I therefore wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here.
Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, the head coach at Tennessee State, told reporters the injury happened just before the halftime break.
He came to the sideline and just broke down there, Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before he was put on a hold and transported for further investigation.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details about the nature or extent of the injury were known yet and Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, which increased his total number of tackles for the season to 18.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty on their property purchases in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty on their purchases of UK property in the future.
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK, with the additional income to benefit the homeless.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue is to be used for the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and rental housing, could be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to generate additional revenue of up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors outside the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their feet on the ground in real estate.
Many of the country's prosperous areas, particularly the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out for a stamp tax cut to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land without using it and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's 'housing degradation'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a staggering series of housing reform proposals ranging from a rental price cap to a ban on evictions without good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
May explained: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hardworking British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem.
Jack Ross: My biggest goal is to manage Scotland
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says his biggest goal is to become manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North East England club, which is currently in third place in League One and three points short of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish First League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bank and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
But I've seen my father play Scotland with me in Hampden as a kid, and that's something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in managing the club.
Ross's previous managers include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'm going to be judging my success by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities of this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League, he explained.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd only consider my time here a success if I brought the club back there.
Ross can only have a three-year managerial career, after a stint as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he's now feeling more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
That was probably a real crossroads he remembers when he took over responsibility for Alloa.
I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than just playing games.
It sounds funny, because I didn't do badly, I could live well off it, and I had some very pleasant highs.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sport Sound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time to have a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study.
The summer heat wave has seen the revenues of Britain's troubled pubs fail to boost, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultancy that compiled the figures, explained: "Anhalten's Sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pubs saw sales increase by 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks were by far the best performers, with a flat-rate turnover that increased higher than the decline in restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffered from the sun, but not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while sales of food decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry at RSM, explained: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main drivers of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales from the previous year will be particularly painful, in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused operators and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breathing space.
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand rollouts.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant industry revenue monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over £9 billion and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that keep them secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools found an increase in so-called fake Insta sites
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" to show their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates social media accounts that can keep it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in so-called fake Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" they could show their parents, but also had private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle is voted the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected at its Annual General Meeting as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board of the Scottish Athletics Association.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded athlete in the sport and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that Scotland's athletics community would benefit greatly from her election to the Council, says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to being the voice of athletes and hope to make a real contribution to the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, claimed four Olympic gold medals and is now a frequent BBC expert, was unable to run after suffering a temporary blood disorder.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'll recover.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I'm doing exercise today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows is a source of excitement online
A milk pump manufacturer created a publicity clip that compared breastfeeding mothers to cow's milk.
To launch the world's first low-noise portable milk pump, consumer technology manufacturer Elvie is releasing a not-for-profit music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you don't see a cock in me".
The chorus goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video met with mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it unleashed the "terror" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young are taken away within a few days of birth, a commentary said.
The milk pump of Elvie fits neatly into a still bra (Elvie/mother)
Another comment was: Realize traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use it to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another person added: This is a strange advertisement.
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "urcomique".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to over-interpret it.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one person.
Another person commented: This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals to the women that everyone was dancing with the discreet pumps in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps report feeling like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go outside during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, explained: The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that come with them, while presenting the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a fun and understandable way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski,while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is higher than ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, among other things because of the Trump administration's heightened rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target of deportation themselves if they sign up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share those data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80% of persons who are either carers themselves or members of a carer's household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal aliens.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet has been rejected.
To speed up the handling of the children's cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to some children's accommodation staff, require them to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the custody was taken, which was the norm before.
Many will appear in person rather than on video to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
If the decision is negative, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely they are, according to information from accommodation staff and reports released from the system in the last month, to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Advocates say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child having problems are more easily overlooked because of their size.
They also explained that the trauma that many of the children already suffer from could be exacerbated if they were taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now in its eighth year of civil war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and were being treated accordingly.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who are deployed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were in place and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that would prevent them from returning home.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make it possible for them to return home he explained.
They're politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey targeted a large-scale offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be taken against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with al-Qaeda, which will be "dissolved".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to the 'revision of the articles of the current constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers probably hope, a removal or scandal did not end his presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever.
So far, there's no sign that the audience was fed up.
Since 2014, the best-time turnover rates for CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show led the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
It's like a fire that magically attracts people because it's something we don't understand, says Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertainment.
Of course, contrary to everything you can find on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, the possible family reunification, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off the TV is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen to be aware that you've already watched six hours of an expert panel discussion about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar straw leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, a "high-profile" garment) or the impact of Stormy Daniel's riveting description of Trump, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show he presents to you every night says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series The Three of the Pond, about Trump's rotating cast and daily action (breaking a fight with the NFL Football League off the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you won't be coming back.
When I reached Flesh this week, it was 27 degrees outside his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he sneaked inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He just couldn't get off the screen, not when Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought this was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Donations flowed through the narrowest race for congressional seats in the midterm elections.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly-drawn boundaries of the constituencies that have led to two incumbents running for the same seat.
The newly renamed Pittsburgh suburban district is running for the Democratic nomination of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a slash in campaign funding between the major party financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives after narrowly winning a highly-regarded special election in March for the state's 18th congressional district.
That seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won there with a 20 percent lead.
Political experts are giving the Democrats an easy lead.
The US reviewed El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
US State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all US foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the US State Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, was considered for criminal action.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year, and represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively ended the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to be the speaker at the conference in mid-October, to signal the importance the Assembly's government is giving, according to diplomatic reports.
The three American diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for John Bolton's government declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the congressional majority changes, Trump will face an agency that will hold him accountable just as he is about to run for re-election, and possibly before a jury.
That's a lot of "ifs" and I don't want to say that the case of Donald Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history is turning around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What are we gonna do when Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's deciding the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the devil's kitchen since this paper reported last year that he suggested recording the president in secret and speculating that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times report.
What will we do if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we'll have a long winter ahead of us.
But I think we're not going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hooked cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about the game against Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians after an impressive rematch against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for qualification for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept Graham Dorrans out of the game until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good, says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game convinced that we could make something out of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated the first half, but we struggled in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can get through that with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with all the injuries I've had and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a kind of well-being factor.
The team's good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look ahead now, leave the last season behind and be successful.
Fear of old age insurance leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the women in the Nationwide study said they would talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have the conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not express your wishes in time, you cannot prepare your family to care for you.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include traditional care insurance, hybrid life insurance to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as you own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Dismiss legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a pre-emptive power so that you can have a trusted person oversee your medical care and ensure that the healthcare professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and makes sure your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that matter.
What is the medicinal treatment?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Have you already completed this plan?
Man shot multiple times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he went home from work with friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 British time, as "willful".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
Due to the faulty communication systems, emergency services were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, extending over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
The administrative district, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for Central Sulawesi's economy, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
The decline in nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Protection Agency, Palu and Donggala have been the victims of several earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, which killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, claiming nearly 700 lives.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and claiming about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook Pidie Jaya in Aceh's government district, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist-favorite Indonesian island of Lombok, claiming over 500 lives, especially on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing reporting of domestic violence, and resisting state violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska Police Department.
According to the police report, he picked up a phone call from an acquaintance when she tried to contact the police.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been issued.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he answered with "not guilty" with certainty, according to the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the reporting of a crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans organizations in 2016 after attributing her son's behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media is streaming videos from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for a rare death sentence for suspects in the New York terrorist attack.
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented pick-up from the Home Depot construction chain for a terrorist attack in which he raced on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, carrying pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the Southern District of New York states.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury court filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which includes eight counts of murder against the background of organized crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violent and vehicular destruction.
The attack demands "deep planning and determination", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out the act as "abhorrent, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a case with the goal of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal crime was carried out in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, gave birth to a child in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to do the deed after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to police reports, that the flag of ISIS be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP calls for the NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise the power of the people during a protest today at the Tory Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip said politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that the UK would be out of the country if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply contested party was exacerbated by the fact that members of her party who are in favour of staying in the EU took part in a separate protest against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister is having trouble keeping her compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between its package and the 'chaos'.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that Chequers belongs on the garbage.
He suggested that Farage be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he were responsible, we would be out already, he explained.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but Chequers is a piece of junk".
He stressed his opposition to the EU: "We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.
The Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we get elected.
Please give up chequers and start listening.
In a spoken message to May, she continued: Prime Ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises.
In a speech, Farage said that politicians must feel the pressure if they are actually cheating on the 2016 referendum decision.
This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class, Farage said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and that is why we are here today to tell them: you will not get away with it
He went on to say in front of a thrilled crowd: "I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists were waving banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app when the conference opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, says Adonis.
This is a farce.
The European Parliament has also called for a European Parliament to be set up to take action.
Warren plans to examine presidential candidacy accurately
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will examine her presidential candidacy closely after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the running for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts House Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign team.
She was the focus of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Arrested for shooting LSU player Sims to death
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of the wound, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-tall Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the World Cup after his team gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in Saturday's qualifying against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes stall orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the box first and got Hamilton into traffic at the end of the driving range, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but was overtaken by Hamilton after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, risking to wait two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back positions of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, holding on to his tires to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round and failed to make a move in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team did an excellent job of winning a double, Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign rally on Saturday, who insisted she had not given the press the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not address the Senate Judiciary Committee directly, but commented that the Senate's proceedings show that people are "common, vicious and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and mean and dishonest", the president said.
If you look at the leaks and you say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Thinking about your answer... you published the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't publish it.
Okay, one second, please.
Did we--no, we didn't publish it, he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein was leaked the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein denies the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish your story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I accepted her request for secrecy.
Your dementia didn't seem to go down well with the president, who said at the campaign rally on Saturday night, "I'll tell you one thing, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed the Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the ugliness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheel to get power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have recovered from their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday with a 5-3 victory in a replay at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early on with two goals, after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were the home team's balance sheet before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard was a good match for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for Adam Keefe's men, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening, the third Elite League defeat of the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyers opened the door at 3:35 a.m. on the fourth minute after a presentation by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation as Beauvillier extended the lead.
In this exciting opening round, Sullivan brought home the team back into the game after 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to their goal line after 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the halftime break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again played out with a power play in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the win with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play their home games at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Plotter died after making sure hundreds of people on a plane escaped the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died trying to get a plane with hundreds of people on board to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the highly volatile control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to fall.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian air safety service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We have deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news, he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country's disaster protection authority said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
The number is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under the rubble while others cannot be reached, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Authority.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy now, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and declared in a speech to the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks that come with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?
Indonesia has already been hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reported missing after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the remaining passengers until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to water the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane through deep water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on improvements near a construction site rushed to shore with a blasting boat before the plane sank to about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
The Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructing the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its testimony on Saturday in a retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period he reported being with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he reported being in Sanford's pickup that night, Sandford said he lied because my pickup was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records indicated they'd known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis was retrieving their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone for some time after Chambers' death.
He's wiped them out of his life, Hale says.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will be held before the jury later that day.
What's more conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to get back to its roots and make hip hop socially conscious again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nursery girl sues couple for firing after racist texting
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother that she was still a black woman.
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to a blackmail.
Dual mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed dismay when she discovered that the new adoptive mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Plasco-flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending these to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice, twice.
After she recognized her fake passport, the embarrassed plastic flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American foster mother had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and is claiming compensation for the $350 a day that she was paid over six months to complete the job she was originally booked for but without a contract and would have used to be with the couple.
I want to show them, look, you don't do that, she told the newspaper on Friday, I know that's discrimination.
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, arguing that firing was the reasonable step, as they feared they would no longer be able to trust Maurice after they had offended them.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, " husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children with someone who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on , now .
Plasco compared the legal dispute to a blackmail and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was in a difficult situation.
You want to sue someone like that?
This is not very nice, the investment banker added.
As the legal battle continued, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Today, it's very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as a very important family member.
He was a very quiet man and did not brag, Jankel said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always left Paddington himself responsible for its success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance, says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart at the pump were slowly dropping and leaving her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't help but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who had not experienced her experience.
Nobody knew, she told me.
I had lowered my head and tears were running down my cheeks the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys were hanging up on a bridge in Wales with maps of inspiring messages and phone numbers for counselling.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day", she explained.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was about to have a promising career as a chef and that he had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could brighten a room.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after his then 11-year-old brother committed suicide.
Davis explained: "I'm always afraid that this could have consequences.
Davis designed the maps to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to talk about it.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was with for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed, she explained.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom of the ladder, and when the children were packing their presents, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything.
She said his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to go through: it's ripping a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt as the FBI begins its investigation.
I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for, that is, a time-limited and limited investigation, then maybe we could get some consensus, Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your reluctance can be traced back to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6 are just five weeks away, and if the Republicans do poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call the senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide on a ballot and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors sinking under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seek, which relies on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that 1127 cases were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park cited stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human smuggling prices as key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly on this.
The overwhelming majority of the North's successors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the trespassers more illegal immigrants than refugees and often returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks on the cancelled denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without the US, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,  said Mr Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and says he's not fit for office at the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was characteristically unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but be impressed that a woman who acted like she was being called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost crying, and almost broke down in tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational murder" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's statement proves he can't serve on the Supreme Court because it shows he's biased against Democrats.
"I think he has declared himself unfit to speak out against these statements and the way he has treated the Clintons and the Democrats", she explained.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
I'll say this: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but for his current position as a judge, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she's worried about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling, because he's considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, Ah, that's not wonderful, Pelosi says.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overheating anger and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Stone told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's rare, do you?
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique.
I'm angry with you.
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying out of an indescribable rage and was dragged into a stairwell by an older woman, a chilly manager, who I was always a little afraid of.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're stinking.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy with you because they think you've gone for the substance.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well thought out decision", she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already underway, she was behind in funding and vowed not to run unless she collected two million dollars.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
In her speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, and anger at sexism that she was close to tears.
You could have assumed I had a nervous breakdown, Schroeder recalls the pressure reactions.
You could have believed that Kleenex, the handkerchief manufacturer, was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
She was crying?
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is not over yet, Beijing could benefit from a long-term dip between the countries, my experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has repeatedly backed off in the same way, recently raising five to 10 percent of the penalties on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economic power will stumble anytime soon.
To move Washington to intervene would mean to give in, but a public nod to the United States would be far too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized, says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the think tank Center for New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country is improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring back normalcy.
The Commission has also proposed that the Community should be able to provide a framework for the implementation of the common agricultural policy.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with much of the tournament, drowned his 16th-runner (par 3) and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest ranked player in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the trophy back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have contributed, says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the singles match 2-1 against American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, who I've been watching on television since I was a kid, says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A curious statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only outscored by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed well throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the American team said after a disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make any of it.
Put your hat on for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.
Red tide update: Concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota is declining
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more gaping flowering conditions are recorded in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating declining concentrations.
A red algae flower extends about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than the previous week.
A red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in or off the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
In northwest Florida, no new respiratory problems have been reported in the past week.
