Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the top and light or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but they do have other features of feathers  hooks and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for breeding. The researchers surmised that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of a full-grown one and not the downs of a cuckoo.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not cuckoo down.

Among them are medium-sized cats, who eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.

The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar doesn't sound like the lion's full-mouthed roar, but rather like a sentence of growling roared words.
Ozelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals the ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that ozeloids track and track animals for food with their sense of smell, they sniff out where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually matching their surroundings and then leaping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.

After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can't be classified as the same species anymore.
This process we call speciation, which is simply the emergence of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

In those days, there were fierce wars between many nobles who fought for the throne.
Tri-kingdom era was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China.Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a ruler alone.
After the Revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class, the army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as Hira on the Mount of Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
actually, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
You can't see anything except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, there is very little to see or hear of this world.

Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, as well as the large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
Aufstriche (AU) symbol looks like a V and AU (AU) symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom line missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Typically, the smoother sound is produced by the smoothing, while the more powerful and expressive sound is produced by the smoothing.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.

To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic, which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.



Car ownership also leads to higher road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romance had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which drew from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged related to this geography and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.




Gothic reached its zenith in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.

though, in the West, the styles are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow channels of communication.


Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, method of crop production in which the ecoregion uses native seeds and combines them with alternative farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
one of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called ""wilder"" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child".
wolf cubs may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific pet, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid which supports individuals in a new learning situation such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Structures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little desk clamp man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educating, but many are forced to.
e system of care is a piece of security for these children.
Our care home system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The care home should cover all the needs they did not get in the home they were taken out of before.
Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication. Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefits and rewards approach.
Learning and socialization are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement andsustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still correctly judge the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations
segregação e recombinação misturam a variação entre os dois pools com cada geração.
Out in the savanna, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like our own to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Plus, if you don't do it, there are serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.

Sleep delay is the process of waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
lf you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effects) so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses correlates in reverse with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibet Buddhism is based upon the teachings of Buddha but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga.

Kundalini Yoga Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collapse of systems, processes and cultures led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.


The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help the UK.

Goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, probably about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were looked after by goat herders, much like the more well-known shepherds, often children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.

Though the conveyor rails consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.

This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
1767 The first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking.Man began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "straight man").
their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not stand up regularly.

It is really evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of the people have become more serious.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that still exist.

Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use the computer jargon.
A poisoning by itself may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of swallowing poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Wanze is a term used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and predators are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental role.


Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotelis' views on all scientific questions including psychology were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.


Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-swinging cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the definitive pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of the phagen with radioactive phosphorus or they tagged a protein in the phagen with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material concerned and whether the cells concerned are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.

examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.


In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.

In developed countries, you rarely hear this much complaint about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems fail so badly, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because you cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically roughly.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find more efficient food and sexual partners.
Most insects can flap their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.

Aristoteles, a philosopher, put forth the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. He also theorized that they transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget, there are many elements in the periodic table.

Theories of content focus on finding what moves people or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood.

Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of demand hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.

This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and committing employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual, who has to do everything differently than the team did it, and who makes everything his own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.

Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? One goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organisation in overcoming a barrier can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) discusses the continuum concept as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, and thus they narrow down the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, like trauma, injury, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.

This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
examples include control, setting strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.

AI is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into numerous home computer and video game software applications.

For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year. The website is redesigned every year, but the earlier versions remain online and serve as a compilation album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills

Blogging  also forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, pupils can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
