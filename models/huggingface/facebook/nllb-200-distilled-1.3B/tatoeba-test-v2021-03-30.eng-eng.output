Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my housing cooperative.

I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom might need to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
It would have been exhausting to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.

I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.

Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could have.

I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom is handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.

I know Tom is through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.

If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?

All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep left at the next traffic light.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid the first time you were on an airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There is a large supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in contact with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids. I'm not a mother.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It is a great responsibility.
I think you should turn yourselves in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know that you and Tom worked together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.

Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom is concerned.
I wish I had had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew that Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.

My daughter is being toilet trained.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think that Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect that Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're such a nerd.
Everybody was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian, you know.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he had been rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or New Zealand.
I didn't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me that he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not need to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's a very clever boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said that he thought that Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't get jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be difficult for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned on living in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she had read the book he had lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone yet that they're getting married.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do that.
I think Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.

You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you. I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary isn't awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake. I'm not going to.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me? I'm not a good person.
Is anyone scared?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We got married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that correctly.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better at French than she really is.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check on it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the end goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you had done that.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never did!

I wonder if Tom is really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said that he thought Mary was good at French.

I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom is not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We are all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just hard-boiled an egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.

I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know that Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know that Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans on doing that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll be there.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready for this.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We haven't even started fighting yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were both right-handed.
Tom said that he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought that everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said that he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
It's going to be okay.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.

I'm twelve years old.
I had forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone that he was through doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know that Tom is much taller than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that's going to happen.
I knew that Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do such a thing.
You are so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows that I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know that Tom didn't know that he shouldn't be doing that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who had stolen Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held at love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said that he hoped that he and Mary could sing together.
I didn't say anything, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You are a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said that he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said that he wished he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We might need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who is able to do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I aren't going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew that Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom really has a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put down their books.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not feasible with current technology.
They said they try to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humor.
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said that he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope that you will be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.

I believe we spoke on the phone.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually need to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know that Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed us all.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have been doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see to it that that gets done.
I wear a suit but no tie.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get angry.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.

Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary is going to do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you would do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning on staying very long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know that Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said that he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew that Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I got lost in the forest.
I know that Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me that he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!

Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do that.

Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it will take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know that you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.

You have really beautiful teeth!

It's not just a minor problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know that Tom has already finished doing that.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom isn't here.
It's not appropriate to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary is scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know that Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could possibly go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.

I don't think Tom knows that Mary isn't happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said that he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we.
Tom said that he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not need to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said that he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.

I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do that with us today.
I know that Tom is very opinionated.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew that Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom isn't so sure.
Everyone here knows that we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know that Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have done that.

I wasn't as successful as Tom.
Tom said that he didn't think he could do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, neither will I.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know that Tom doesn't know that I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought that Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're going to be okay.
I knew that Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he was glad that that had happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know you're not stupid.
She didn't show up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we're not supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom is in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom is flaky.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom was aware that they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary had asked him not to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will be going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired. I'm not going to.
I'm 18 years old. I'm not a kid.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we could do that.
Tom said that he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grew up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.
I didn't think we had enough money.
You should have heard me, I screamed as loud as I could.
I'm giving you what you want.
I knew that Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
I know that Tom is a good writer.
They said they'd never want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
- No, I'm not going.
I know that Tom isn't a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed.
I know that's gonna be hard to do.
How are you planning on doing that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's going to be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were being cute.
I thought you'd learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wished they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know that Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm a lot taller than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can too.
I know that Tom would be quicker at doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that a lot better.
We work every day except Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's the reason Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I seriously doubt that Tom did that on purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that the other night.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs that are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom is as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom isn't as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that on our own.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never been in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a cell phone.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time that you and I went to Australia together.
Tom isn't the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me that he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I peeled off the lid.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for over a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know that Tom is a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather vane.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer. I'm not a farmer.
It's not easy being married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not worried.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's Canadian.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I presume that Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you are saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me that he's not sure what he should do.
Tom told me that I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not need to do that.
I knew Tom probably wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said that he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he doesn't plan on going with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everybody likes free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know that Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're prepared to help me.
Tom isn't the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you still wanted to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed.
I don't think I can hold out much longer.
Tom isn't as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying to me!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom is talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe that everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know that I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to draw attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom is doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when it rains.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourselves.
I think that everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said that he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I am a college student.
I don't think Tom did that, but I could be wrong.
What country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that's not going to happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said that he had given a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know that Tom was a skinny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans on doing that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me that he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room as me.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room sofa.
I found out that both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was prepared to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's all right tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
It's not Tom who needs protection. It's Mary.
They said they were irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought that I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things to do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anybody here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone please help me?
I know that Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easygoing.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It seems like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle into her new apartment.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they'd never done that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.

They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I have seen Mount Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like doing that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.

Someone's got to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said that he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said that I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is only when you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know that I was still planning on joining the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't very clean.
They said they were safe.

Tom thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.

Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom doesn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom isn't missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I would do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said doing that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I never should have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew that I would be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything about it.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says that he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance exam?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.

Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised that they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Could you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me that he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home alone.
Tom must be irritated.
How long have you had headaches?
Thank you, buddy!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has earaches.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.

Tom said that he thought doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No pain, no gain.

I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.

I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can count on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that's not very likely to happen.
They say that drug is not safe.
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom is going to call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't. I'm not going to.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a Kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said that he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said that I had to study French.
You're not obligated to do that, are you?
You got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know that you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I did.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said that he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.

I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.

I'd like to visit Boston again.
My time is taken up with teaching and studying.

I knew that Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom is downstairs.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big collection of postcards.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew that Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is there anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here. - What?
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was eventually going to leave him.
You're not still scared, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You will suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know that Tom is nice.
Tom already knows Mary is planning on doing that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there many Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.

Check out that girl.

How have you been feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
