28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Francisco Supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a supermarket.
But the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his brother, pointing out that: “His life finally began to improve.”
The body found near a Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a San Francisco court medical examination office spokesman said.
San Francisco police said his death was found to be a murder and an investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother, Luis Galicia, tells ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago went to his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
“We’re a small team that works like a solid family and we’ll miss him very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, we are thinking with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia tells us that at first Frank had been staying in a hostel, but recently his life has finally improved.
"He gathered in a new apartment and met a girl," Lewis told KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn’t know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always comforted his family by cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch," said Luiss Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in quarrels.
He was the one who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New medical strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are calling on their trade unions to launch protests over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Physicians Committee (JAK) is about to call on the council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that the ministers have failed to clear doubts about the agreement.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
The agreement was voted against by 58% of all members who participated in the vote.
In a tweet posted on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena McCarthy notes that the government continues to be silent on this issue and therefore the deal offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote has resulted in a full rejection of the contract proposal and a decision has been made to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government’s silence, JAK today officially requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts that would come into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, a representative of the new doctors of the LMA, resigned.
Before meeting with the 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be signed with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an abandoned alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it gave the impression that this partnership is more needed by Ankara.
Both are collapsing.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked shameless and did not cause warm emotions, even given his usual abstinence.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called Putin his “dear friend” at least five times.
I lost the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes contradictory feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the shooting down of a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow then reacted.
Putin has accused Ankara of throwing a dunce in Moscow’s back.
It was even more painful given that it came from a friend’s side.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, even impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months, the government-controlled television has spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for it all.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan’s own family had profited from illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
Of course, he himself denied this.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of Ankara’s peace settlement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month, in which he was attempted to overthrow.
Numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken his positions.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually provides for the influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are resumed.
They are hoping for a vacation in the Mediterranean during the end of the season.
Earlier this week, Turkish state television predicted a decrease in the price of fruits and vegetables, as imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes, “Tourists for them, tomatoes for us.”
But there were other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for, in her opinion, a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
It can also be added to the discontent with the lengthy accession talks to the EU and Putin’s intervention, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained extra points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, as it itself has deep-rooted fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analyst called it, a “abandoned alliance,” a two-country alliance that feels excluded from the West.
But despite publicly demonstrated unity, there are still considerable differences between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carrier of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two presidents declared at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
But after months of openly hostile relations and a potential disaster, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, the situation has improved as the two leaders at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
The brand SKB will continue to play a supporting role, the bank’s chief executive said.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
It has given up on these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it is decided to put other national brands in the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banana will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, except the headquarters and official listings, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank will now also gain attention.
Makevan was interviewed during a trip with clients and employees across Invernesshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: “SKB will become a brand for our investors and work with our employees because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
“It’s time to become a brand bank, because we’ve long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?” says the CEO.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs, we obviously have made a big change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th victory, winning first place in the New Market with his horse Predilection
Detorians take off champagne, winning their 3000th victory by finishing twice in the first race at Newmarket.
On Friday, Joker Frenky Detory won his 3000th victory in British history, winning first place at the New Market.
He achieved this by winning a second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, playing with Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth joker to such a result in a horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery and William Carson.
Three-time champion Joker Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very excited because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Askot, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are welcomed with applause and cheers.
Two jackers have broken this record in obstacle races - champion Richard Johnson and 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Pigot, the nine-time derby winner, has won 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of today’s best jockers and it’s no surprise that he has achieved successes that only a few can.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jets.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom Race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 victories if he didn’t just take part in the weekends and the big races.
But seriously speaking, it’s a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning the UK races for 30 years.
He is happy with life, which is great for British racing, and he is an excellent jokeer.
Frank Detori celebrated this achievement with his brand name - the flying landing.
From finishing at wind speed to flying landing, Frenkie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This was a journey full of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous “Great Seventh” in Ascot in 1996, survived an airplane crash and was disqualified for using drugs.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character strength by challenging those who questioned him to return to his best shape.
And he could participate in the race for a while - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue to participate in the race until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been among Putin’s closest people for many years.
Currently, the 63-year-old politician is appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin “decided to remove Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” without giving any reason.
Ivanov was replaced by Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old is a deadly diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as president of the country by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to resign and recommended Vino as his replacement.
Does a smile convince?
This move has upset Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a long-time and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, at one time worked for the Soviet security service in the DPRK.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
During a session broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, rarely whom such an explanation convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of a struggle for power?
No one knows.
But the official claim that a man who was considered a possible president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy is seen with great skepticism.
In the comments posted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov told Putin: “It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult position, one might even say, a problematic position, for four years.
I worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the DDR National Security Service, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the DPRK, Ivanov took the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin’s second term, Ivanov was considered a potential presidential candidate because Putin’s re-election for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and returned to the presidency after three and a half years.
Mysterious appearance of fish in a garden in Banff City
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the circumstances of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bean thinks that 75 fish could be sand oysters who dropped with the waterroom.
Mr Bean, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these 5-inch fish got into his garden.
Quinsphere Crossroads: The bridge is now connected to Faif.
The project, currently worth £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensland crossroads and the viaduct, meaning the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connective parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is approaching its completion.
The construction of the Faifa Bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project, currently worth £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Kate Brown had arrived at the site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: “This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensfery Bridge.”
In this project we see an unbeatable engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of these parts alone.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final stage that will connect the bridge with Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be laid.
Michael Martin, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: “The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge.”
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the support of the northern tower, we had to connect the northern section of the road with the land part or viaduct.
This was done by twisting the northern part of the viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Enormous because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be lifted slopingly by about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simona Bailsa wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the worry.
Simon is not worried about it.
A dynamic leap.
Without effort perform exercises on the balcony.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Absolutely flawless .
And finally an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 points was a head trial over the silver medal winner and her teammate Aliya Raisman and the bronze medal winner Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa performed an exercise on balcony gymnastics in the individual multi-fighting final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row to win the multiplayer championship title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually consolidating his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she shed tears because the long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts him next to unbeatable athletes like Michael Phelps, who took his sport to a different level.
Bailsa has dominated her sporting style for the last three years, winning 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such outstanding, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called her "the best gymnast she ever saw."
In Brazil, a final test awaited her, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her, rather than with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailes (left) and Aliya Raismane have kissed after winning gold and silver medals, respectively, in the individual multi-fighting gymnastics final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special farewell party of the random coordinator Martha Karolji.
Although Bailsa claims she hadn’t expected anything like that on her long journey to the heights of fame, it’s not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and discovered by the mother of coaches Amy Burman on a trip to the gym, where the Burman terns took place, has now become a force to be counted on.
She hasn’t lost in multi-fighting races since the summer of 2013 and the series of wins can continue as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafina got a bit out of the lead in two rotates, it was just an illusion.
The balance ball and free movements – the part of the race, where Bailsa will defend his championship title, is just ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the ball and strengthened the lead with a score of 15,933 in free movements.
Raismane gently embraced her as she waited for the results, which was just a formality, and she spilled out in tears of joy when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raisman's outcome was like a small revenge for four-year-old events when she shared a third place with Mustafin, yet lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans referred to as the "grandmother", emerged in a convincing leadership.
After performing in free movements that wiped out doubts about her return, she was able to devote an air kiss to the crowd.
Meanwhile, the viral Twitter post of the 19-year-old fear, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahaj Braun survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, saying it was the second six-year-old boy to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child’s grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahatma Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in the thigh, leg, arm and stomach, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television: "His little body was just rotted with loci."
I cannot believe it.
The boy has been hospitalized in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
His family says he will recover.
He had to start going first class at a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia that one of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of them was the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several gunmen were likely involved in the shooting.
At the scene of the incident, weapons cartridges belonging to various weapons were found.
It seemed to have been a long shooting.
Both sides of the pedestrian passage were found.
“It appears there were several gunmen here who were actively involved in the shooting,” said Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars were also damaged.
No one has yet been arrested and it is that police are checking surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, a missing bullet struck a six-year-old girl in the hand while she was playing in front of her home in the Westouklein district.
He is recovering, but police are still looking for the perpetrator.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby and Laurie?
I call it the Women’s Olympic Team of the Year for several reasons.
First, I have been at all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three athletes in the team, Simon Bailes, Gabriel Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Aliya Raismane, who is a Jew, and Medisona Kociana, who is a Catholic.
Ultimately, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best gymnast is an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabi took 1st and 2nd places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gaby Douglas surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champions Simon Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in individual multi-fighting for women.
Her teammate Aliya Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation in gym hours is completely different.
Simon, Gaby and Laurie entered the Olympic team like Ali and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five", as the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Karol as a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is a expensive sport. Exercisers mainly train in private athletics clubs and areined by parents who pay for training, rooms, trips, uniforms, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in such urban districts that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take all their workouts, and this is a costly and long investment for athletic families.
Amy Burman – Simona Bails’s coach and Megi Haini – Laurie Hernandez’s coach have trained their athletes since both girls started playing athletics.
We need to provide young girls, inspired by Simon, Gabi and Laurie, with cheaper gym training options.
I founded my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer gymnastics training for more than 15,000 city youths (mostly black and Spanish) for free or at a low price.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, logan and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and aim.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to practice athletics and that’s fantastic.
Engaging in this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of the Girls’ Power, winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s offer was rejected, the new doctors plan to spread more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on amendments to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to sign the contract, stating that the NHS is in an unstable state and further delays would only harm staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for working at night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Dr. Elena Makourta, a spokeswoman for BMA’s new doctors, said yesterday evening that new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the workforce crisis and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks until the first group of new doctors signs the new contract, so progress must be made because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the issue through negotiations have encountered the government’s reluctance to intervene and sometimes total silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunt stated that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop inaction, and work with new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to the picket.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on amendments to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate on weekends for 54,000 new doctors covered by new contracts.
NHS Employment Director Daniel Mortimer urged new doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on overwhelmed workers and worry, stress and barrier for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months we have spoken to the new doctor’s committee and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and reporters.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, graduation and gender pay inequality in medicine to show that employers, England’s health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously looking to implement the agreements reached with BME in November, February and May.
Drinking about 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend taking it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurring heart attacks in people with heart disease.
These drugs are already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack.
NICE, represented by the NHS, recommends taking this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NHS currently managed NICE recommends taking this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a thrombus, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thrombus separates from the blood vessel wall, it can go further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of recurring heart attacks.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend people to take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice a day along with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Kerola Longson explains: “Despite the availability of medications to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences.”
Fear of a recurring heart attack can leave a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurring heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend treatment options to thousands of people, which is thus beneficial.
Given the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding when using this drug for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend using it for longer than this period.
Political correctness culture promotes election fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfour Rahman, was fired from office in connection with corruption.
A government report reveals that a culture of political correctness has opened the eyes to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickl criticizes police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the election process because they “are afraid of offending ethnic and religious interests.”
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organization, says voter intimidation for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to deploy guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
For now, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voting voters with a special ink to avoid double voting.
Whistleblowers should also provide greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says, “The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.”
The report was ordered by Dauning Street following the scandal in connection with the city election in Tauerhamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled to remove the mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, from the post of mayor for corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the assertion that the religious duty of Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were fake or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in mail voting is disturbing, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a personal identity document to verify the identity of a person.
His report states: “Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for senior-elected candidates in communities, in Bangladesh and Pakistan.”
“There are concerns that regional institutions are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, as they could offend ethnic and religious interests.”
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, which also included banning political activists from acting with votes delivered by mail to prevent "vote collection."
The report, which was reviewed by Theresa May, also called for closer registration checks to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.

Sir Eric has sharply criticized the Metropolitan Police, expressing his misunderstanding that there are no charges in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: “The electoral court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and fraud.”
He was convincingly found guilty by the standard of criminal proof, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient "check-check" of city council voters in the voter registration districts.
Sir Eric says: “The court ruling last year is a call of alarm.
Our country is known as the homeland of parliament, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretending of the institutions that fraud does not occur threatens that good reputation.

A CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer was “finished like a pig.”
Bairon McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha's finish in fourth place in a 4x200 m free-style staff for women has provoked a storm of outrage among CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flown out of the race, drowned alone" and "finished like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when the 4x200m free-style women's staff outlined his personal opinion at the end of the final.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to give commentary vivacity, said: “That little fourteen-year-old from China can’t keep up with it.”
"Too squeezed, she flew out of the race that she drowned alone and ended up like a pig."
A great thanks!
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana scored 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to hit China.
Viewers across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet, as they were shocked to hear such tones and expressions.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "finished like a pig"????".
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the direct ether.
Ai Yanha of China's 4x200m free-style final for women was named "the little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't go along."
Criticism against Byron McDonald quickly took effect, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe when they heard Byron McDonald’s insensitive comments.
Sarah Paradi, a Twitter user, wrote: “Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and because of you we all sound like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was the head of the CBC live broadcast at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the result of swimming sounded live."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald’s colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
CBC then gathered an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly posted an apology and announcement.
We are very sorry that such comments have been made and that they have come to the direct ether.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Bairon’s comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
However, these were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the live ether and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In a CBC Olympic live broadcast, he said: "I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show disrespect and I really regret that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly holds in the middle of a underwear store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to take off her clothes to put her pants in the middle of the store.
Worsening the situation even more, she pulled them to make sure they fit her and then dropped off, laying her pants back on the shop shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone and picked up four more pants.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – where this woman laid her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, two-child mother Jenny Davidson was also in the store, who tells us that a strange woman put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She pointed out that people couldn’t believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underwear from the shelf, took off her socks and pants and measured them on the spot.
She didn’t even try to find a more discrete place to measure them, she just kept them there.
Everyone watched her take off her pants and apparently the woman didn’t like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more pants until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
She didn’t seem to be bothered that someone was watching or thinking of a person who would buy the clothes she was holding.
Davidson’s young woman (33 years old) from Kent says: “It’s common to think that somebody will buy clothes that have been worn by someone else and that have not been washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's young lady adds: "I assume that the shop staff took the mentioned clothes off the shop shelves after she left - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has put it on and then it’s not washed.
A Primark spokesman said that Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9.
Certain clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at close range from gun attackers, we talked to Krav Maga Grandmaster Ron Mizraki from New York.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and overcome the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then you must first turn around to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon must be closed between your front arm and shoulder and make a blow to the opponent’s face with your free elbow.
Then followed by a stroke with a carpet on the cradle and while the attacker struggles in pain, he must take away his weapon, step in the face with the weapon's spire and retreat, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - it is necessary to avoid the trajectory of the shot, open the weapon and blow it out so that the evildoer cannot shoot out.
At the same time, put pressure on the weapon and strike the opponent on the chest and finally take away the weapon and retreat continuing to target him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not a Krav Maga master, then it is safer to return your money to the thief.
A family of vandals demolishes the social house of Saltash Cornwall and is placed on the street.
A family of vandals is forced out of residence for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to a social home worth £50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were taken out of a property in Salt Lake Cornwall after a number of complaints were filed about them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing officials found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was dumped everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now out of property and most likely lives in some private property.
Cornwall Housing Service Manager Donna Makevoja says there are concerns that the housing will not be able to be renovated.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people can’t live that way.
In this case, a number of factors should be considered, because in the future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed in the property and police say their terror manifested in violence, outing the street with baseball sticks, intimidating locals, using drugs, selling drugs, and loud blasphemy and slander.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the property, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In the demolished houses were found waste.
In the house, where the drugs may have been previously traded, several floor boards have also been pulled out.
Neighbors say they are regularly on the street and are constantly called by the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property when they were given 11 weeks to voluntarily leave the house.
The exhausted neighbors were very happy with the departure, because their life was an absolute hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about other people.”
We’ve lived alongside them for 20 years, it’s always been crazy.
It’s unbelievable how often we’ve seen the police here.
I could not sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they are finally away, it will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighborhood protection at Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and regularly called the police here.
In the grown garden of the house, various old and unused objects were found.
He also said, “It’s very unfortunate that tenants didn’t show any responsibility for their behavior, as getting out of the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service.”
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and it was very difficult for neighbors to observe their behavior.
I appreciate the work done in this case by my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the commune who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope this event will facilitate the lives of neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said the three sons lived here at different times, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
Service workers will now have to tap the dump of waste left in the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was found guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended to commemorate her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the departure, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimut.
On the walls of many houses were painted graffiti.
The police say they will continue to expel tenants who violate their lease agreements.
Police spokeswoman for Devon and Cornwall, Angela Crowe, said the departure was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said: “This is a warning to those who believe they can behave as they want and there will be no consequences.”
Criminal and antisocial behavior is not acceptable for the Devon and Cronwall police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beach.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Cannes has banned the use of burkini swimsuits on the city’s beaches, which almost completely cover the woman’s body and very much resembles a water suit, local officials said on Thursday.
Cannes Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "access to the beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone without a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"A swimsuit that exhibits religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may pose a risk of disruption of public order (crying, clashes, etc.) that needs to be addressed," the order said.
“We’re not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about wearing clothes that are associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are at war with us,” said Thierry Migul, head of municipal utilities.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since July 28, when the right-wing Central Republican Linar signed the decree and it entered into force.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women wearing burkini in swimsuits because of the outrage expressed by both right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-covering headdresses for Muslim women, but religious symbols or corresponding clothes are not forbidden.
On July 14th, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Nice, which was held by Islamic State.
On July 26, two terrorists who had sworn allegiance to Islamic State brutally murdered priests in a church in northwestern France.

The festival “Cuba” began in Lucavsal.
On the evening of Thursday, 11 August, in Lucavsal was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - there until Sunday night will be held "Kubana".
On the first evening, the gathered were lamented by such bands as Enter Shikari from the UK, which was expected last year but disappeared from the program, American banks NOFX, DJ Maxim from the group The Prodigy and others.
Also in the next days of the festival there are notable names on the program – “Guano Apes” and “Garbage”, the bandit of the pancrok legend “Ramones” Markys Ramons with “Marky Ramone’s Blitzkrieg”, “Brutto&Lyapis” with the Belarusian pancrok leader Sergey Mihalok at the forefront, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, the Ukrainians “Vopli Vidoplyasova” and a number of other, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but this did not prevent the organizers from repeatedly attempting - they added a long mark to the title, included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening at 19:15 on the stage climb "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and gained local colorite alongside such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is still too early to judge, because the festival has only rushed in, but, as the first evening observed "Delphi Entertainment", at least for the time being a huge crowd of people has not been able to attract and the number of visitors was similar to last year.

The British team won the final with a score of 42,440 seconds, defeating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for the bronze, the French team defeated Australia.

The president who remained in the shadow: Gustave Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12th, it will be 145 years since the birth of Latvian President Gustav Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the country of Latvia, but unworthy has remained in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakstes and the last President of the pre-war period Karl Ulmann.
No other of our statesmen has so much defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgals, writes Arnolds Auziņš in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal published a decade ago.
In an interview with the portal "Delfi", Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest, like these, are always right.
He taught not to be like that, today it might be the same as Raymond Veyonis.
“He was one who was close to the people,” he said.
Modern politicians know little about history, they referred to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely anyone knows how disgusting he was.
The only person to whom he did not scream was General Balodis.
Even though in pictures he was kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
“Zemgals with his sense of humor and democracy leaves the exact opposite impression,” says Auziņš.
Aivars Stranga, a professor at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with Delfi, agrees with Auziński’s assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and balanced statesman.
He also noted that Zemgal stood out with respect for minorities and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At the time, it was not a usual action, after the Zemgala presidency, Albert Kviesis took on this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and weighty man who had to get used to becoming president for a long time.
He did not seek it himself, he simply did not earn fame.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know French, but believed that the president should definitely know it.
“The basics of the French language were learned during the presidency,” Stranga explains.
Zemgals did not allow him to be persuaded to run again, he did not really like that high position.
In any way, he is a very respected personality in the history of Latvia, already before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Zemgals also managed the famous Zemgala Treasury on Suvorova Street 3, where the Association of Savings Managers and Collectors was located, in which the Latvian state practically entered into government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He was not a big fan of Ulman, but he was also not publicly opposed.
“In private talks, however, it has sometimes been stated that the actual actions of Ulmanis do not sympathize with him,” Stranga said.
He lived a peaceful life, without any suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How do you remember Earth today?
It is a pity, but most of it is associated only with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
"There were no major shocks during his time, i.e. he could associate himself with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, a Latvian state visit to Sweden also took place, which indirectly meant for Latvia at that time full recognition of the neighboring country and inclusion in the democratic nation-house of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgal arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
King Gustav V of Sweden visited Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the appearance of a child’s anger, the appearance of anger, parents see as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" notes psychologist Ekaterina Kess.
The specialist urges a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - the anger and anger that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical act directed against another person, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, agitated - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger within ourselves: express, suppress, hide, hold within ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can rage on the couch, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to ward off anger!), take a shower, sink with a kulak on the table, and do other things we normally don’t do.
We do not direct our aggression toward others, because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
When children get angry, they don’t understand what’s happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They may say, “Go away!”, “You’re a fool,” “I don’t see you,” “I won’t fight with you,” and very rarely, when they can say, “I’m angry with you.”
Children live in a literal sense, they are fully present right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and sincere in expressing their feelings, and are often also captive of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prohibit the child from showing feelings, including anger, do not regret it and do not complain, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do you need a break in relationships?
A day of spirit work in which everything didn’t go exactly as you would like, or just a bad mood – there are so many reasons why you would like to “disconnect” from the whole world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to break the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Or does this indicate that each of the partners has its own path?
The opinions are divided by men of different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: “In my view, if a relationship requires a break, then you’re not with the right person.”
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about every little bit, then this is definitely the right time to explore other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or you don’t think about her in particular or even don’t want to see her anymore.
So the answer is, yes, keeping a break can help you save time and realize how important the other half is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to keep a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then quarrels are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every little thing the other does, and it starts to fall on the nerves.
People start to get upset with each other, especially when they don’t even have anything to talk about anymore, just about what you’ve done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that elsewhere or elsewhere is better, then why does this woman you’re with deserve one who can think that here isn’t good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a small betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I condemn a little those who don't have." said Edmund (46).
Charles (33) has an entirely opposite view.
Everyone needs a moment of rest.
You can’t look each other in the eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice over the unending love.
Thou shalt go!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, for a girlfriend or wife, too, but if both of them can maintain the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then they can survive to the edge of the grave.
That and only that.
Martin (27) said: "It is difficult to say whether or not it is necessary, whether or not it is possible to take a break, but one thing is clear - the initiator has something in the relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question comes out, then it should be expected that there will be some changes in the near future - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I mean, while you are still young and crazy, you need to pause – at least all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together.
“If you can’t withstand each other’s society now and you need a breath from time to time, then what will happen when you’re retired, who comment on how the cats are cuddling or argue about which day the garden is better to cuddle,” explains Kristaps (19).
All the names have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rosenthal first aroused the interest of the Latvian people in the visual arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable," wrote Roman Suta about the old master of Latvian painting Jani Rozentali.
Also in 2016, when the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition was opened in the restored main building of the Latvian National Art Museum, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it will be open to visitors from 13 August and will be visible until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with an extensive retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall honors the painter Jani Rozentali (1866-1916), whose 150th birthday is included in the UNESCO celebration calendar internationally.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Jainis Rozentals anniversary year program.
The selection of artworks is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Art Museum, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classical creative activity, stylistic variation and the diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, Writing and Music Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The centuries-long atmosphere is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the connections of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art, at the same time offers the first stop of the small informative travel exhibition "With a Look in Finland, with a Heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with content presentations in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the autumn in the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Matt Leblanc is looking forward to returning to the show TopGear.
Matt Leblanc, the head of TV show TopGear, said he was looking forward to returning in the second season of the car show, but admitted he did not know what awaits him in the future.
Nothing is officially happening yet.
“If they do, then the BBC will report,” Leblanck told television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas on the Floor!" arose in July when Leblanc's counterpart Chris Evans announced he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanck and "Gas on the floor!" are "like made for each other."
Evans describes the former star of "Friends" as a "true and good husband", thus wiping out rumors that the friendship between the two broke during filming.
When Leblankm was asked what he liked most on the show, he replied that traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC that the show has no plans to replace Evans for the next 24th season.
Meldonia could be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes this year.
It is expected that meldonium contained in the drug Mildronat produced in Latvia could be excluded from the list of banned substances for athletes this year, Ivars Kalviņš, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, told LNT on Friday morning.
He said he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist said he hoped Mildronate would be removed from the blacklist this year.
After the collision, two cyclists were taken to the hospital.
In Siguld, on a street in Switzerland, two cyclists collided, receiving various injuries, state police said.
Both men born in 1987 and 1990 were involved in the accident.
A cyclist was also injured in the crash.
A man born in 1989 died on the street in 1905 and was taken to medical care.
In addition, a motorcyclist born in 1989 tried to escape a dog that ran out of the road and stumbled.
He is also in the hospital.
In the past day, 71 road accidents were registered in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.
In some places, it will flourish and become cooler.
Also on Friday, some places in Latvia are expected to be temporarily raining and will become some degree cooler, the agency LETA learned from the Latvian Center for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
Locations are possible.
According to the forecast, rain is expected mostly in Kurzem and the north of Vidzem.
The maximum air temperature will be within +16, +19 degrees.
The day in Riga will be without rain and mostly the sun will shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backstory of the U.S. model business in his interpretation gained the gloss of a perverted refined photography session and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically, it is a very provocative work, balancing on the refinement and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the boundaries between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre product.
The film with Vigo Mortensen emphasizes the question of whether the conceptually chosen life patterns of parents (ecologism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and detachment from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring blessing or destructivism to their children.
An idealist father of six children, after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and true values.
A thrilling, life-saving film whose author Matt Ross won this year's Cannes Festival Award for Director.
Of course, the shark just does this as an attack on beautiful meets - in the cheeks it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, portrayed by Blake Lively.
The work required her to be a hero.
This survival solo summary can be compared to James Franco’s role in the film 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds’ role in the film Buried Alive.
Per, the blame is also on the main character sculptor Mila Kunis, whose transformation from a model mother to a creative survivor and almost a family-value murderer seems to be merely created by the fantasies of all-out Hollywood screenwriters.
Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State fighters fleeing Menbeij in Syria's Aleppo province have captured some 2,000 civilians who are used as live shields, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus," a spokesman for the Kurdish military council in Manbij said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij has been liberated from the jihadists.
Islamic State captured Manbij in 2014.
The QSD has already expelled most of the Islamic State fighters from Manbij last week, but some have resisted and showed strong resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are heading to Jerabulus, located on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based group of Syrian activists, that the Islamic State group had kidnapped about 2,000 people.
SOHR that Islamists hijacked the city’s inhabitants’ cars, forced people to crash into them, and then took them to Jerabulus.
Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, while seizing territories in the province of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria.
Later, the Islamists released about 270 of the prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled from Manbij is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish military council in Menbisch said the QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbisch.
According to SOHR, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, were killed in the fighting.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kołegova has resigned from the candidacy for the post of Chairman.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA informed in the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova says her candidacy debate has increased the conflict between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with evaluating my professional abilities.
“This is also not acceptable for me,” emphasizes the former candidate for the post of the VID leader.
In the event of her candidacy being approved in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow to work fully and to realize the necessary changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, a full-fledged work would not have been possible, concludes Kolegova.
“I have repeatedly stated publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is too politized,” she said.
"Thank you for the trust and support you have shown me, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," Koļegova wrote in a statement to Reizniece-Ozolai.
Unity said on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegova there were "significant contradictions" between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers about the dividends costs of SIA Pallogs, as publicly available decisions of the meetings of the participants of Pallogs foresee not to distribute profits.
Currently, the duties of Chairman of the Ministry are held by Deputy Director-General Dace Grey.
In Lviv, police are involved in the rescue of two small children left without supervision, informs the State Police’s Latgale Regional Administration.
Notice of unattended carriages with babies received on Friday at around 7 p.m.
They were found in Lviv near the former store building.
Both children were immediately handed over to medical services.
There was also a suitcase with documents and a cell phone.
In less than half an hour, police investigated the possible location of the children’s parents and went there.
Upon arriving at the woman’s home, the police found that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of heavy alcohol.
According to preliminary information, on the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 stayed with a girlfriend, where she consumed alcohol.
Already walking home after a joint sitting, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unclear circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court, which will also decide on the future fate of the child.
Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Harbor Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on the Russian Island port activities to move from the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed in the company.
The approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Riga Free Port Board.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the VK’s view, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Administration also guided the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the international auditor Deloitte at the Riga Freeport Management and the recommendations for improving project management in the future phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the VK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port Administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the VK on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian Island project, we treat the implementation of the project and the funding provider – the European Commission (EC) – very responsibly.
I would like to emphasize that all the planned construction works within the project are fully completed within the scheduled timeframe and in the planned amount.
“In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and the steward, that the main goal of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the VK on project management and supervision issues,” said Sanita Kaire, project manager of the Russian Island.
For the purpose of monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective, the existing long-term operational plan was supplemented with the main planned activities of the parties involved and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and periodic reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important thresholds.
The approved action plan for achieving the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the VK, was supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the timing of activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Riga Free Port.
In order to improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been redesigned, defining the areas of project management and indicating the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure scheme has been developed, reflecting the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve the communication of the Riga Free Port Administration with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the parties concerned for the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of the exchange of information.
In order to improve the control of the use of funds, the need to conclude or initiate a service contract and the rule of law will need to be justified in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure of the Russian island has been built in accordance with world standards - four new deep-sea ports, railway accessories, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund were completed and put into service at the end of last year, resulting in funding savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Security at airports in Slovakia has been strengthened.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday tightened security measures at several airports, the Ministry of Interior said.
"In light of the threat, we have strengthened security measures at the international airports of Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the information we have received," he added.
The European Union (EU) will hold an informal summit in Slovakia on September 16th, in which all member states will participate except the UK.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia holds the Presidency of the European Union until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the number of deaths near the former East German border may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the real number of victims are still not cleared.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people were murdered at the border with allied zones and later communist authorities in West Germany in an attempt to escape their territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned while his family tried to get to West Germany through then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet deserters.
"The ultimate extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Alexandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to flee a communist-controlled country are cleaned up and not destroyed," Hildebrant said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is unconvincing," said John Stath, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Taking into account the number of people who died trying to flee the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the territory of neighboring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not directly related to violence.
“If seniors aged 70 to 80 died of a heart attack after collapsing with border controls, it must be the consequences of this ‘murderous boundary’,” says Hildebrante.
But the State is convinced that there should be a distinction between old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose deaths were caused by long waiting in hot weather on the bus at the border.
Regardless, the counting of victims is not easy, as the communist authorities of East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers must search the documents in various scattered archives, state said.
However, the State Group has recently obtained new documents, so it could soon come up with a new estimate of the number of victims.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with a coach accreditation; for himself it is a surprise.
The late president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspar Pone, has arrived at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with a trainer accreditation, but he himself is surprised by this.
On Wednesday, a widespread riot broke out after Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakov’s coach, German Jakubovsky, revealed that in the last minute he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while Pone had to stay home.
Initially, the list of approved riders included swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Kolins, as well as Federation President Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants for the Olympic Games, and before leaving, Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans will be and tickets are being sought for him.
"H, apparently for objective reasons he did not go," Pone said, expressing the opinion that it did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the Federation, the coach of Uvja undertook to help her.
Mr. Pone, who is himself a member of the LOC Executive Committee, has sharply criticized the LOC’s activity, blaming the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organization.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five people in the Executive Committee and not to take one out of them.
“I don’t know why the Swimming Federation didn’t have enough space,” Pone said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated by the society, and reminded that the presidents of the federations were not paid.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he filed a complaint with the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. Pone could not explain why he was in the Olympics with the trainer accreditation, which most likely had to match Jakubovsky.
“I was nominated as a team leader, but for unknown reasons I got the accreditation as a coach and now I don’t get anywhere.”
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment I thought German would be, because I had no other information.
According to information available to the agency LETA, a couple of days before the start of Ribakov, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after the swimmer was with tears in the eyes, however, the LPF president himself stated that it was a daily conversation with the desire to mood the athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF oversees five sports that are on the Olympic program, and four of them are being trained for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation stated that the issues of sliding in Latvia are also very important and he also talked about such programs, while in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the Federation’s work and stated that the World Cup phase could be held in Latvia in 2018.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.
There will be 600,000 babies in Doha.
During the AS Latvenergo fish resource restoration program this week in Daugava, near the Mangal Island, lax and timber babies are being dumped, and this year more than 600,000 one-year-old lax and timber babies, raised in the fish farms of the Bior Tomes and Doles scientific institute, are planned to be dumped.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the loading of fish will continue in the coming months - each year in the waters of the Daugava basin a total of 6 300 000 different species of fish babies and larvae are allowed.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, the larvae of the frogs and nuggets will be released, in June - the siga, in July - the single-summer salmon, in August and September - the zandarti and the wimbs.
Latvenergo Production Director Māris Kuņickis said that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo’s sustainable development.
“In fish resource protection and reproduction measures, all activities are aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by raising and letting fish in the Daugava basin, and by realizing other activities,” Kuņickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and stallion babies will be allowed into the Daugava stallion.
Already the second year of fish babies before landing are marked by cutting the fat spruce.
Today, the cargo brought contains 25,000 lax babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year in scientifically based species composition and numerical volume in Daugava and its basin water bodies fish babies and larvae are landed.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies in accordance with normative acts is carried out by Bior, on the basis of an expert analysis of the losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo’s economic activities and giving a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of this assessment, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo’s annual compensation in the fish resource restoration programme is EUR 1,035,000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We fish" for the fifth year, is installing 400 artificial fish nursery nests in Daugava near Kaibalas and Ikskila.
The cooperation with the association to promote the natural breeding of fish is an initiative Latvenergo further supports within the framework of the fish resource restoration program.
The placement of artificial nesting nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" has a countryside, forest, cirsma.
Sleep in a tent, eat as in a restaurant, walk in the bars and listen to explored chamber music while enjoying the quiet peace of nature – such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansouzi, which invites you to the region of Akniste for the third summer.
The festival will take place in Susie - an inexisting village - in the courtyard of the former farmhouse, next to the woods and shrubs.
During three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine the refined enjoyment of natural and academic music.
Here with music meet the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest forms, find young listeners in a free and open environment without the rigidity of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to a smile in the face and lightness in the feet only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can be captured only by spending all three days in it," invites the initiator and host of the festival, operabaryton Armands Siliņš.
The festival opens on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
There will be a program with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, as it is the most saturated - from 9:00 a.m. until the next dawn.
"The names of the artists are available on the homepage www.sansusi.lv," says Armands Siliņš.
The colourful artistic bouquet includes, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, chellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartets Quadra and RIX and even Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erik Kiršfeld, Martini Zilbertu and actress Anci Strazdu created the contemporary circus performance Confines about the artist’s inner struggle.
There were also special events for the festival.
In the children's show "Kukainis", composed by Oļesja Kozlovska and Jakab Nīmanis, along with Armandu Siliņu, musicians and actors will participate entomologist Ugi Piterán.
Oskars Herliņš wrote the first Styrous Quartet, and Anna Kirise - The Tree Opera, a performance, the main characters of which in the direction of Andrzej Kalnozol with the video projections of Katrina Neiburg and the scenography of Andrzej Eglīš will be trees in three small poodles in a three-hectare wide coal.
Singing in the voices of Laima Leden, Dinara Rudane and Zigmar Graş, they will enter into a romantic relationship, just as the Swedish natural scientist of the Enlightenment Karl Linney’s study of the Wood Wedding (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are opened today by one of the highest hopes of the Latvian delegation, seven-time athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the race at 15:35 Latvian time in the 100 meters barrier race, and at 16:50 will be expected the race in high jumping.
On the night of Saturday at 2.35 a.m. starts the bullet gravitation, while at 4.05 a.m. starts the 200-metre sprint.
The seven-fighting race will end on Saturday with long-hauling, squeezing and the 800-metre race.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won bronze at the World Championship last year, was mentioned as an Olympic medalist.
In May, the Latvian set a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fighting competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won ninth place with a repeated Latvian record.
In the past year and a half, the athlete has improved the national record four times.
The start is scheduled for Latvian judo fighter Artur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first round of the match with Azerbaijani athlete Ushang Kukauri.
This will be the first Olympic Games in his career.
The agency LETA has already that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms loss already in his first fight experienced Latvian judo fighter Yevgeny Borodavko.
He ceded to the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later won bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zeļonijs brought Latvia the Olympic bronze prize, but in the next four Olympic Games Latvian judges in seven battles together won only one victory, which in London made precisely Borodavko.
At 6:30 p.m. after the qualifying time of Latvia, Dainis Upelnieks will start shooting on the stand of the qualifying race, but the selection will end on Saturday.
Upelnik received the Olympic travel stamp only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that he had been quite safe about driving since April.
Athlete arrived at the site of the Olympics as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the course of the competition.
At 19.05 on Latvian time, the three rides will be held by the Olympic Games debutant 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes in sailing windshields in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine runs, Birzule is currently in 25th place among 26 athletes.
On Saturday there will be a final tournament for the medals.
Today is also scheduled to be held a competition in academic irrigation, in which to participate the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pušpurea.
The race was cancelled on Wednesday due to bad weather.
Pušpura will compete at 19.10 in the C/D semi-finals for the only women, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, in the quarter-final race, she scored fourth place, from third position, which would allow to continue the fight for the medal, lagging 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure won the 13th place in London four years ago, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be distributed at the Olympic Games – in arc shooting, athletics, trekking cycling, hiking, shooting, trampoline jumping, judo, academic skiing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland as Supreme Court judge.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is confident that in case she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland’s approval since March when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Scaly.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid’s spokeswoman later said he hadn’t personally spoken to Clinton about the matter and that it’s just speculation.
He praised Garland and stated that Clinton's team't want to "shake the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "fake" and acted in the interests of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Trump is not suitable for the presidency.
Treats announces a nude photo calendar for women and men.
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Belmer to create a 2017 Pirreli calendar in the 1970s style.
In its 2017 NU Mouse calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats magazine president Steve Show announced that his erotic art magazine differs from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is a men’s magazine.”
This magazine is for women.
He also talks about the calendar.
In a press release about the calendar creation, Shaw said: “We need to return to portraying unshakable and classic nakedness in pictures, where a woman’s body does not disturb, but inspires both women and men.”
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person for casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
The buyer, after testing the motorcycle, leaves behind.
At 10 a.m. on August 10, a Yamaha YZ250 motorcycle, which was not registered, was stolen from a house yard in Rembates.
The owner of the motorcycle, by means of an advertisement, wanted to sell the engine.
At the agreed time, a potential buyer arrived, got on the motorcycle as if to try it and left.
Employees of the Ogres Police Division of the State Police Administration of the Riga Region request to recall anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the criminal offence.
Call request: 65002403 (at work) or 65002400 (all days).

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says the longevity record belongs to a female, who may be 272 to 512 years old and five meters tall.
A French court has rejected the demolition of shops in the "Jungle" refugee camp.
A French court has rejected a request by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of self-constructed shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, authorities stated that the state should demolish 72 self-made stores, where in the camp area people trade various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The prefect’s office in Kalye pointed out that these self-established companies must be demolished as they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, and also pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small are critical because the food provided by governments and support groups do not meet the needs of the camp, where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who had set up 72 self-made stores, but it understood the Prefect’s concerns.
Judge Jean-François Molla said food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than just providing food to people who live in “extremely harsh conditions.”
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons, and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult escort.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
A letter to the Guardian said the liquidation of the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
On Friday, two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to 9,000, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins silver in a Rugby-7 series battle when the Fiji national unit masterfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the rugby-7 stage ended on Thursday, when in an exciting final fight at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio Fiji, the national team convincingly defeated them with a result of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in the handling of the ball, the playing of the balls with the foot, the playing of the support and the playing of the brutal force, winning the gold – the first Olympic medal in the history of its existence.
The defeat brought a revered consolation prize - a silver medal, which was Britain's third medal at the time. The British team can boast of their success in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough battle in the semi-finals, in which the Boxing team suffered a defeat with a result of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably struck Britain in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is currently in its best shape to win a 15-man team as well.
Although unlikely, yet a certain consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. This is Fiji's random head coach Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan’s leadership, they lost all the matches of the Rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively kicked off the match, discouraging Britain's power techniques for pleasure.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his comrades, it was like a collision with several opposing buses and the World Series champions took the lead with 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the advantage by landing on the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team didn’t even really touch the bomb.
Mitchell’s great power technique prevented the characteristic Leoni Nakarawa from getting three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji’s result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua landed in the right corner, consolidating the advantage over Britain to 17:0.
After the overplay, Nakarava further increased the preponderance and had more than a minute left until the end... the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some of the rough British force techniques and crossed the line to score points.
The result was 29:0.
It seemed that the Fiji were born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were just learning.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team made profound changes in the half-time, breaking the Fiji line of players... a full four minutes, which was good on the first half standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Den Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and scored 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the Southern Islanders fans sang, waved flags and danced in the tribunes.
It is impossible to ignore Fiji’s happy attitude.
Mata William made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
When the game ended with a whisper, the Fiji could start celebrating, but the British were able to sit down on the bench after defeat.
In the first half of the day in the semi-finals, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very harsh battle both teams gained by landing and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kail Brown put Box in charge of the team, while in the second half, Dan Norton brilliantly crossed the line and delivered the ball between the pillars, ensuring the British victory.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony of England’s rugby-15 team player,’s excellent strength technique at the end of the game gave the team a victory and another silver medal.
Coach's struggle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Stanning to win the racing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heter Stanning played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although only the two athletes were on board, they were accompanied by Robin Williams, who inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in women’s pair racing, becoming the first women in British sports history to such success.
They undoubtedly dominated, as for the 39th time they won an unbeatable, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with the elegance of a gulb sliding on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal won, there is a whole team working hard to ensure that the athletes continuously improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success was made by a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
It disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and so it happened.
If it did not, it would spread throughout the body.
The situation becomes uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the mid-season of 2014 and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if so to say.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulates recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked a distance of 6, 10 and even 15 meters, although the doctor said a few steps would be enough.
So it all started.
It was a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought immediately came to William, who was very anxious all morning and spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: “This was an emotionally tough week, but it means a lot to me.”
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been wonderful.
Without Robin, we’t have achieved anything, so great thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I can’t imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heter Stunning have not lost in a race in five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that the competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover's dominance was too big.
We feel every moment.
Helen cried, “Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
Not losing concentration is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we didn’t have high expectations.
On that day, we didn’t intend to break records, we just played well and won the race, and we did.
It will take a few days to decide what to do next.
Next month will be Glover’s wedding with TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, “The feeling is fantastic.”

The Chairman of the Board of Directors will continue "to the end".
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinski (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Dan Reizniece-Ozolai (Union of Greens and Farmers) are already “principally important” to approve the candidate led by the finance minister Kolegova as head of the Ministry of Finance.
Raevsky estimated that for both Kučinski and Reizniece-Ozol in this government, the approval of the head of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs is the "first major decision" that can affect his future as a politician.
If the decision to change the position of the candidate for the post of Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman.
The agenda of the Cabinet meeting next week includes the issue of the transfer of the head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the government agenda.
Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola appointed Kolegova as head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after Ināra Peterson resigned from the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the competition for the post of Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ended without a result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday, Dace Pelek said that if she was offered to run for the post, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he is not considering any other candidates for the post of Chairman.
Raivis Dzintars, the leader of the National Association of Seimas, also acknowledged that NA continues to support Kolegova in the leadership of the VID.
In Spain, the potential to reduce the budget deficit is threatened by the failure to form a government.
On July 12, the European Commission (EC) ruled that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce their budget deficit to 3% of the euro area’s gross domestic product (GDP).
Despite the austerity measures implemented, the budget deficit in Portugal at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain it was 5.1%.
The European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on the two countries, but has set fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the Commission has failed to impose sanctions on both countries is the growing euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics, however, point out that the Commission is not consistent in its decisions, agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then failing to apply them to life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, giving citizens the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommendative rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the budget deficit settlement deadline until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission has pledged to test the progress made by both countries in the coming months, but said both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances require it.
Preliminary forecasts indicate that Portugal could be able to meet its targets on time and the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5 percent of GDP this year.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Program, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year’s budget, with a further focus on controlling the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, for the next two years, consolidation measures should be at an annual level of 0.5% of GDP.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on forming a government for eight months makes it difficult to these goals, and the possibility is growing that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
But polls show that the third election would not significantly change the political picture in the country.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s People’s Party, which would win less than 33% of the vote again.
The popularity has increased slightly only by the socialists, while the popularity of the party “Podemos” or “Together we can” and “Ciudadanos” or “Citizens” opposed to austerity measures has decreased slightly.
The People’s Party wants to get Socialists and Ciudadanos into government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As Rafael Hernando, a member of the Parliamentary Group of the People’s Party, has said, if a government fails to form and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing spot for Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
During the fifth year of surveys of the beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately the number of waste found is increasing every year, and this is mostly the guilt of swimming pool visitors.
The most polluted swimming areas are in Riga.
The capital government explains that swimming pools are cleaned every day, but fighting against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, waste left on land can be swallowed into water during rains, thereby significantly deteriorating its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzem, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This was announced this week by volunteers from the “My Sea” campaign.
During the five-year walk along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year the critical assessment has entered.
“We see that this will be the year when the amount of waste on the 100 meters of the beach may even exceed 200 units,” says Janis Ulme, a representative of the expedition “My Sea”.
Called by Latvian Radio, he was on the beach of Tuja, where the volunteer march continues along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, among various household garbage and picnic remains, activists even had to collect daylight bulbs left in the sea sand.
The participant and organizer of the tour Ulme said that the people are responsible for the pollution.
“The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, ranging from bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the degradation stage, they can no longer be identified, and smokes, bottles, curls,” says Ulme.
Among the dirty beaches there are also swimming spots in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgry, on average, almost 800 units of waste are collected per hundred meters, which is critical.
Campaign organizers also explain that smokers are also put on almost every step and no warning or prohibition signs are placed everywhere.
“The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together – Daugavgrivu, Vakarbuļļi and Vecāki – are unfortunately high and far exceed the desired or target, to which Latvia is allegedly moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020,” concludes the environmental defender.
Bathroom cleaning in Riga takes place every day, even twice in the hottest days of summer, explains the representative of the Duma Uģis Vidauskis.
However, dealing with dirty visitors is quite difficult.
Let us return to the culture of these people.
“Those who drink, drink, smoke and do all the things that are not allowed to do, even special signs do not work,” Vidauskis said.
Therefore, Vidauskis urges swimming sites visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and in this way all fight.
There may be some new warnings, but, as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
“Because everyone together should simply turn and be intolerant to such offenders,” he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out this summer for the fourth time by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in all other years, the quality of the water is good and satisfying.
Currently, the situation is such that the water quality of all 56 swimming pools has been good all the time and there are no swimming restrictions.
"The last time we will take the analyses will be in late August," said the inspection's senior specialist for environmental health Normunds Kadiček.
During heavy rains, waste left on land can be swallowed into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotating of the Russian elite continues - the change of the leader in the Putin administration.
Have you left the job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to resign as the President’s Special Representative for Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin gave Ivanov his words of appreciation in front of television cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have worked with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with how you are fulfilling the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well our agreement not to use you in this position as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I understand your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will also use your knowledge and experience to the fullest in your new position.
However, it is highlighted that leading the presidential administration is a very important position and that made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that elections to the State Duma are due in Russia next month, rumors have spread that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called Putin's possible deputy president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the position of the president's representative on nature conservation and transport issues raised doubts.
According to the LSM.lv archives, Ivanov is a general colonel of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov was an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his course in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
During the reign of the first Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin's rise to power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, and already in 2005 - the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defense industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the post of head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
The guilt comes from the family of the Soviet party's elite.
The position of head of the presidential administration was recommended by Ivanov himself.
I and Antonia have known each other for a long time.
From the time you were in government.
And for the past almost five years we have been communicating virtually every day.
"Therefore, I am confident that after all the professional and personal character qualities he is ready for this job," Ivanov said.
The guilt came from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet Party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988 as its first secretary.
The Internet magazine Medusa, referring to the book "Estonian Self-Determination and Independence", writes that in the late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to permit the use of force against the protesters.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his position.
Shortly thereafter he moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
In recent weeks, Russia has been shocked by the dismissal and arrest of several senior officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives in several districts.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is rearranging the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 election.
One of the main features - representatives of power structures are increasingly in the leadership positions.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko also loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that there were very little expectations for Nikiforenko, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the Judo fighter suffered a shoulder injury in the battle.
Remarkably, in order to get to the Olympic roadmark, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual – i.e. in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani fighter was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki stood for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed to cast a cast worthy of pure victory.
The Judo competition in Rio de Janeiro has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by Jewish Jevgeni Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but ambitious people can sometimes surprise.
He did not make.
For Arthur Nikiforenko, the task was even more difficult, because the experience is less and the opponent is also respectable.
The result was similar, though on the tatami he stayed almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvian Jews are mostly lacking in ambition.
Since Gunars Kirson and his financial stut Vladimir Šestakov passed from the leadership of the federation, Alexander Jackevičs left Latvia, the "Golden Score" is no longer taking place - the development of judo runs downward.
Jackević, who advises Kazakhstan’s judges here, and Vsevoldo Zelyonius do not see heirs.
But if it doesn’t move, it won’t.
This is the prerogative of the Federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy, the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised to win medals in Rio.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš – Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
The intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers' games ended.
The Latvian duo had a small deviation – they could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension increased in the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy court sprinkled throughout the length of the match.
For the players, the brotherly wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be our - which is more comprehensive - ally.
But did not become.
Playing against the Latvian duet here was quite easy.
Serve it to Samolov and wait for it to break.
Against Canada, Cuba broke up at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third set, because the load was not on the laugh.
He could fish at the time, because there was little work, but when there was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilian Samoilov could be defeated in two sets, as in the first set he took the lead with 16:15, but on 16 also remained, exhausting the limit of losing points.
But it was also possible to lose with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third was already in the Evander serving mark.
A chain was formed - a convincingly taken server, the second game often flies too close to the net and Samoilov had very few options for a resultant attack.
If there was a stranger in the square against the Cubans, then this time he acted more successfully, and it would be unprofessional to bring a loss only to Saša.
Kreilis also made a mistake, and quite symbolically that the last ball in the block was hit by him.
Losing the team.
This time definitely missed success – in the third set only two Evander attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two passes were next to the line.
Also, the controversial episode of the video decided in favor of the opponents.
If in the first two games Evandru was tortured with servers, then against us they were very productive.
Everything was lost on the table.
Now the causes of the failure should be calmly analyzed.
Per as many should live next to the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
Per a little self-confidence gave the seven-final series.
Per we shouldn’t have played in Klagenfurt, but we should have arrived here sooner and better acclimatized.
Per there was a mistake in finding the top of the sports form.
There are more questions than answers.
Our games are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments and the Masters.
In his life, he has never been and will never be a friend, because he has too many different personalities.
But it is also not necessary.
When a dream of Olympic medals is broken, the thought of divorce can also arise, because the guilt will be sought not only in yourself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers play beech, but John and Tom have already tried and also divorced themselves, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world’s peaks.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, to return to Martini Plavini, but it will not be better than this option, which has not once proved itself in the World Cup stages.
Copacabana's sand did not smile to them this time.
and all.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are coming into circulation, and only the rare height is less than two meters.
This is not yet a guarantee of success, but is an important argument in the struggle for victory.
The ones are not longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to host in the locations offered by the game organizers, as well as to choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have sought a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time for the modest accommodation offered by journalists were demanded exaggerated prices.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment Irish.
The risk is because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Kopakaban and Ipanema.
200 meters from the beach, half an hour walk from the beech arena.
The area is quite safe because of the favelas, but you should not lose your vigil here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100 meters barrier run and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa lagged from her personal records.
There are five disciplines.
After a break of 10 years, "Porgy and Besa" sounded in Liege.
Porgijs and Besa was first performed in the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeated.
This is why the organizers of the César Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum in close cooperation decided to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s masterpiece.
“We are very pleased that after a break of ten years, when Liepaja was able to enjoy an opera performance for the last time, this magnificent version of the concert study of George Gershwin’s “Porgy and Besa” opera can be with us in the newly opened concert hall “Great Ginseng”,” says Baiba Bože, director of the concert hall “Great Ginseng”.
The opera “Porgy and Bessa” is a story of love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
“And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep,” says director Viestur Kairiš.
What I like most is that when listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops – famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this structure," the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the concert studio of the opera "Porgy and Besa" Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous opera of Gershwin.
It is good to feel the breath of the world.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lam.
The concert study was special by the fact that in the newly opened concert hall "Great Gintars" for the first time an orchestra played in the orchestra hole and for the first time an opera concert ceremony was held.
The square near the restored building of the Art Museum could be named in the name of Jainis Rozentals.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks at the opening of the Rosenthal Jubilee Exhibition said that the address of the museum itself could in the future be not Krišjānis Valdemāra Street 10a, but Jaņa Rozentala Square 1.
The director of the museum, Māra Lāce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a heavy bureaucratic burden, but the idea is generally appreciated and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936 with the establishment of a monument to Burkard Dzen to Jan Rozenthal, which stands next to the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I’m a little bit upset all the time – but William Purvity, where will we put his name?
“But if you, Mr. America, promise to think about it,” said the Bear.
The National Museum of Art, after an ambitious renovation and modernization, officially opened its doors in May this year.
The renovation of the VEF Cultural Palace will finally begin this week.
The castle will be rebuilt for approximately 11 million euros.
Several rooms of the castle are planned to be renovated, including two auditoriums, as well as the building to be adapted to people with disabilities.
Riga Duma intends to attract six million euros from European Union funds for the project, but Riga Duma’s Property Department Director Oleg Burov admits that for now there is no clarity about the European funds for the project.
“Despite the political will to start repairs at the VEF Cultural Palace by attracting European structural funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be granted or not,” says Burov.
We were told last December that it all depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to make its own decision that Brussels will not make a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussions is forming again, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I want to say that the Riga Council without a doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed on time,” Burov said.
It has already been that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the immediate, upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building has not yet begun and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga Duma Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Cultural Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction sets, where each will ensure the implementation of different palace functions.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Cultural Palace and improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the neighborhood and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is to improve the offer of VEF Cultural Palace services.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, the restoration of walls and ceilings, the stage and sound recording studio, as well as to arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve the equipment of the workshops, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" the legendary rock band can be seen in the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will showcase various "Līvus" characteristic objects - photographs that are arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from its beginnings until 2010, when the group's end is announced.
The participants will also be shown stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert papers, as well as other things not yet seen by the general public, which reflected the creative activity of the group "Livi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the Liepaja Museum.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elite Patmalnieci.
Also, musicians who were associated with the group "Livi" and their relatives, appealed to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be sought in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble is created in the Liepaja Cultural House, led by Juris Pavítols.
The ensemble participated in its original composition in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavítols met Erik Kiigeli and founded a group in the Metalurgical Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrīdu Gūtmani, Andri Krūziņu and Jāni Grodumu to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been considered not only once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing – the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing – remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys felt different from the generally accepted stereotype of an estrade singer," said the group's music viewer, Klas Vāvere.
In addition to the above-mentioned musicians, there were such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Rusviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Stark, Laimis Rācenājs, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27 in Liepaja Concert Garden "Pūt, vějiņi" will be held the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "Livi" "LIVIfest 2".

Zbigniew Stankevič: The time comes, and the truth rises.
The Archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevičs said in an interview with Independent that if we want to gain strength in life, the gospel message should be placed at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the strength of evil.
Many are already on their way to the feast of the Enlightenment of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the believers receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main worship in Aglon has been expressed by the Pope’s nuncio.
Therefore, the main content of the message is also in his sense.
It is also a kind of tradition to develop that the Cross Road is led by Bishop Janis Bulis.
He will also make his own message.
The previous day I was conducting the Holy Vigil service.
Last year I addressed the Encyclical Laudato si of Pope Francis and actualized the common house, the theme of the earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I’m watching what’s happening in the world and I’m trying to react to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s suggestion that the gospel message should be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of man’s life and inspires him to go further.
It speaks to people.
But in Cessis, in the Light discussion, you said that "return to the consciousness of the full man."
What do you understand by this?
Does this mean that a man deviates from the message of the church?
Does the church have such a resource today?
In the capital of India, a man is robbed by a dead man on the road.
In the Indian capital, no one has heard of a man dying on the side of the road – it turns out that he slept on the side of the road for an hour and then was robbed, the BBC reports.
It is that the man, who was identified as Matibul, was driving a rake during the day and worked as a guard at night.
Matthew was on his way home at 5:30 in the morning when he was struck by a car.
Surveillance cameras showed that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour, when no one was aware of the bleeding man, he was robbed by a carpenter.
About 90 minutes after the shooting, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died of injuries.
With the withdrawal of her candidacy for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova saved the government from fall, says Associate Professor Ojārs Skudra of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova’s explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy due to contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In a speech with the agency LETA, he said it is difficult for him to imagine that "United" would support Kolegova's candidacy at a government meeting next week.
Therefore, if the “Unity” ministers voted against, but still approved Kolegova in office, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
Also, the expert believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova consulted with both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozoli and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it was also a concession to the "Unity", which firmly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether it will be possible to find a suitable candidate through the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected, or the agency will continue to run as the CEO of Dace Grey.
At the same time, he points out that if the finance minister has previously stated that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a hint for the Gray that he cannot participate in the competition.
LETA has already that the head of the State Environmental Service Koļegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director-General of the Ministry of Environment.
Due to "unity" objections, the government postponed for a week the approval of Kolegova as Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she is still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, later opinions changed - on Friday in a petition to Finance Minister Dan Reizniece-Ozolai she stated that she would withdraw her consent to the transfer to the post of head of the Ministry of Finance and this is not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska’s press secretary Andrey Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
There was an accident in Riga, involving a police car.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon a road accident occurred in which a state police car was involved.
A police car with sound and light signals turned on rushed to the highest category call, until it collided with another car at the crossroads of Baron and Dzirnavu.
Police are clarifying the circumstances of the incident, but initial information shows that the second engine did not miss the police car.
One woman was injured in the accident.
This year, the population of Riga decreased.
At the beginning of this year, Riga had 638 784 inhabitants, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital had officially registered 641 000 inhabitants, the Agency LETA informed the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capital cities of the European Union (EU) countries and the major cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the statistical office of the EU, Eurostat, Riga has the highest proportion of women – the capital of Latvia is convincingly ranked first among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
The three capital cities of the Baltic countries have the highest proportion of women in the major European cities: in Vilnius there are 123, while in Tallinn there are 121 women per 100 men.
There are warning pictograms.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gailite, a representative of the property department of Riga, told LETA.
Currently, the repair of the glass speed of the museum, which was caused by the activities of skateboarders, has been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be placed on it in the coming days.
They will tell residents that the coverage tends to be slippery during rain and snow, it is not allowed to travel by cars, as well as to visit by bicycles, skates and skates.
Ushakov also wrote about this on Facebook at the time, stating that no security threats are caused by the damage, but "seem unaccurate", and skateboarders "should have to drive."
For children and parents, new children’s playgrounds are set up in Riga.
This summer, the Riga municipality has installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kīpsala and Čiekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trubes and sliding mountains is installed on the Chipsalas beach.
The playground is intended for children of all ages.
In the field are also installed slides and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is fulfilled by an attractive location on the coast of Daugava with views of the passenger port and the cruise ships there.
In turn, the playground between the 4th and 5th crosslines of Čiekurkalna has a playhouse, batut, stairway, balance bridge, slopes, playballs and other game elements, as well as a gym area with rings for strength and coordination training, along with other sports elements.
Under the area there is a rubber cover in different colors.
Next to the playground, a new, colorful bridge cover has been erected on the side of the street.
A reconstructed section of the road has been opened.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) management, as well as the builders SIA "Binders" and representatives of the municipalities today opened the reconstructed section of the main state highway Russian border (Grebnevo) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Granice (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of how, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the country’s main roads is improving.
“As the forecasts show, in this planning period, the resources available for roads will be learned already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most congestioned roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding,” Uldis Augulis emphasized.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction works from Medum to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The renovation costs € 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
“The reconstructed section of the road has been completely restored and repairs will begin next year from Medum to Daugavpils itself, thus arranging the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils,” said Janis Lange, Chairman of the LVC Board.
The country’s major highways are the most loaded, and by 2018 we plan to get all the country’s major highways in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing timely periodic maintenance and performing the replacement of the asphalt overlay every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers are looking forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange noted.
In the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the Medumu center.
Significant groundwork has been carried out: large-scale reconstruction in four stages and large-scale incubation and accumulation work, the longitudinal profile of the road, which until now was very uneven, has been leveled.
Public transport stations have also been renovated and a turning point for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient carrying capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road shared the terrain.
The next construction season is planned to restore a section of the highway from the border of the city of Daugavpils to the now reconstructed section (144.80-156.40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometers of national roads.
Information about all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
“In order to desired weight loss results, the right choice of food combinations is very important,” says Lithuanian dietitian Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, this is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A thoughtful combination of dietary products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also targetedly promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel moody.
Cayenne peppers and protein-rich foods, such as poultry meat or protein cocktail, not only produce a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings after large meals at subsequent meals.
This combination of foods can increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdominal area.
The composition of eggs contains a metabolism-enhancing nutrient - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking in sufficient amounts of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and thus the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body.
The oatmeal crust, which is added with fresh berries, is another tasty and fat-burning meal for breakfast that is worth including in your menu.
Peas and berries contain fiber, which, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, controls ghrelin – an appetite-stimulating hormone – and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are assistants in weight reduction and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins can also do wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they promote a feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the process of digestion and provide a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid?
Fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch found in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits break down mechanically in the stomach, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth stage in the digestive process that occurs in the intestines.
The hardness is divided into three different stages that begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "trapped" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow up.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peanuts, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products along with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of which has a different strength, characteristics and time to enter the stomach.
Cranberry, honeymelon, muscatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you consume large amounts of protein-containing products, avoid consuming fat altogether.
This also applies to refreshment - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (containing proteins) with an entire avocado (containing fats).
Such a combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How to cook better?
"Cooking, thermal processing leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of products," says the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients are lost when foods are boiled in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods increases, directly boiling.
After cooking the vegetables, the remaining liquid is recommended to be used for soup preparation - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
Vegetables are recommended to be cooked, including steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in the composition of tomatoes.
Cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes increases the amount of lycopene by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal processing of eggs and meat deprives the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Also, the thermal processing of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
Keep in mind that freezing foods can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but freezing the fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-creating iron found in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products, than blood-creating iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-creating iron in the body by taking non-blood-creating iron-containing foods in the diet along with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-creating iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to the muscles and brain.
To get the most benefit from salads, add healthy fats to them, such as olive or flaxseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines to non-added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed by the intestines and plays a vital role in the bone formation process.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) along with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, strawberries, avocados and other fruits or berries help stabilize cholesterol levels as well as avoid clogging of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect criticized for caricaturing the Asian
Snapchat representatives say the filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racist-insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in an absurd way every day and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or an image that fits in the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are cloudy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have been criticized in the past, receiving accusations that the app promotes too black or light face skin tones as a benchmark for ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were released, allowing users to create skinny eyes, skinny teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist cartoon of the Azores – “yellow gems.”
It was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denial erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the lens is intended to depict Anime images, not to caricate people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarities with Anime.
Korean-born American art student Grace Sparapani’s Twitter post on the images gained widespread resonance. In an email she states that the lens effects are “offensive and uncomfortable, not to say more.”
She added that it is difficult to ignore the visible similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat’s large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then “these things don’t go unnoticed today,” said 25-year-old Kathy Zhou in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager at Medium, deleted her Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article on “Medium” and in a telephone interview, she explained that, in her opinion, racial problems arise due to Snapchat’s employment policies that under-support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the company’s leadership, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
“This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Or some representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not take such a position to be able to express their opinion safely and conveniently,” says Zhou, a Chinese-American.
Others agree with her opinion, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origins of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a human resources specialist who will focus on bringing racial minorities that are not widely represented to the company and will promote inclusion in the company.
Zhou, on the other hand, did not renew his Snapchat account, adding, “Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to realize that this is not right.”
The House of Congress says military officials have misrepresented reports about Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Representatives said U.S. Central Command representatives misrepresented the reports, portraying the war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it really is.
Central Command intelligence analysts have expressed general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task unit set up by Republican representatives from the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Financing Subcommittee, stating that their leadership controlled reports of American advances in the fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that monitors U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report says that intelligence reports, approved by high-ranking Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it really is. Facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses show.
California Republican spokesman Ken Calvert says, “Centcom’s behavior is unacceptable – our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive false reports.”
Centcom management errors are sought in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the Central Command’s reflection and analysis of U.S. efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide unwavering evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration had misrepresented reports, it suggests that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to present a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
In the first half of 2015, the Central Government’s press releases, statements and reports to Congress depicted the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom officials have publicly announced that the operation to recover Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq’s second-largest city still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Party spokesman Mike Pompeo said in a statement: “A multi-month investigation clearly proves this.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior officials of the U.S. Central Government distorted reports, depicting ISIS’ threats in Iraq as weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a working group after learning that analysts are concerned that information about Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, a report published on Thursday will follow new findings in the case.
The Ministry of Defense’s General Inspectorate is conducting an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence activities.
Members of the Intelligence Management Committee of the Democratic Party published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree to some of the findings of the Republican Working Group.
Democratic spokesman Adam B. Schiff said in his report that Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process “stopped the spread of information”, undermined the work ethic of analysts and “distributed facts inconsistent with the truth.”
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to develop reports according to "a pre-determined or political stance."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, the New York Times that the Pentagon General Inspectorate had opened an investigation into the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report as long as the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defense and the Intelligence Agency call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by an increasing number of Defense Ministry officials).
But last year’s charges raise questions about whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration about military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade-old events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the war in Afghanistan without thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hucker also played an important role in uncovering the intelligence issue of the Islamic State.
Last year officials that the Hooker team revealed that contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil plants did not significantly deteriorate the terrorist group’s financial situation as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times in the September issue that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Government.
At the time, Centcom’s commander, General Loid Austin III, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers thought war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the U.S. duel with Britain in women’s field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus achieving the fourth victory in a row.
A day after winning over Japan with a score of 6-1 on Thursday, Katie Bama scored her first two goals for the U.S. women’s field hockey team, when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember if she had ever done something like that.
She said, “I have no idea.”
I am not one of those people who count their goals.
But she knows that the U.S. score at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives her in her group an undivided match with Britain, which on Thursday, after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0, remained unbeaten.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the final match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six-team group and which second.
The first place winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
Even if Saturday’s game did not develop, the Americans have already caused a surprise storm, four years ago in London occupying the last place among 12 teams.
There was also a bat in the team.
She grew up in Blubel, the field hockey stick she first took in her hands at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in the sport in Dresden) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the history of the team.
She did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, England’s Craig Parham was appointed as the random coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it “culture, mentality and physical change.”
We did not invest in London as much work as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama revealed the result, scoring a goal in the first half with a back-to-back throw from close distance.
India started the game without a win on their account, but their team was very tough and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama regained goals.
She entered the ball into the opponent zone on the left side of the square, then noticed getting into the middle of the square and sending the ball to the opponent’s goal, putting the Americans in the lead 2-0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first dry game by U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Brig, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She is entangled.
The same goes for Bama.
“We’re going very well right now,” Paham said, but how well exactly, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food in the period of depression is “Sweet Meal”
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in an oval room to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted delicious culinary delicacies such as the pasta of the beetle or fuagra and the Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sausage and dessert – a slime pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says: “It’s a way to solidarize in cooking with people who have had a very hard time.”
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "It's also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou’s last book, The Vegetable Soup, describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman, in his book, The 97 Apples, describes life through food at a rental house in the lower eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, The Satisfactory Meal, which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they held a meal together by reporters at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch diner located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929 when the Great Depression began.
Mr. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and crushed olives, while Mr. Kou, 57, ordered chicken, potato cheese and vegetable salads.
When a reporter ordered a fake rabbit, the couple admitted that his choice was very relevant to the conversation about the Great Depression food.
Mrs. Ziegelman told me that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut rabbit, a liver rabbit and a bean rabbit.
They were prepared from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it feels like to eat as many peanuts as you want to have in place of lunch.
Mr. Kou was upset.
"It probably seemed like the stomach was full of lead," he added.
In pre-depressive years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women cooked food for their husbands-workers, and fresh-cooked snacks were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans.The "Sweet Meal" described how the Americans adapted to conditions when America suddenly was no longer a land of abundance.
“At the time, food became the main focus of the American people’s everyday attention,” says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on the subject.
The new budget diets became equally important: unknown foods such as fake rabbits and snacks became everyday, snacks were “a great way to use excess,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unattractive ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American dishes for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of the food was more important than the taste, new, unprecedented formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for cooking onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch table supplement."
Ms. Ziegelman emphasizes: “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions are not compatible.
Many home recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined a nation’s eating habits that were not experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become “economists” and take on challenges such as turning a mixture of pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
The “Sweet Meal” is a meal of historical delights.
Particularly interesting are testimonies of the government’s attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “let me eat a cake” attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, he actually ate like the subtle millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says, “He liked European cuisine like fish with cucumbers sauce.”
He ate in an almost golden living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had advised him to be an example with his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a housewife who did not learn how to cook, making the White House a place "where not only one of Washington's most tasty dishes was served, but also the worst cooked dishes."
As soon as the country’s economy recovers, most of the culinary patterns of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science to cooking, Ms. Ziegelman added.
The couple say that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw food out.
“She was really afraid to throw food out,” Mr. Kou said.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, “She actually harassed people.”
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we had eaten at the Eisenberg dining room, a couple of writers took out a home-cooked dessert from the bag: a sludge puddle that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
“It’s a foam cream,” said Mrs. Ziegelman, adding that at the time there was a common habit of giving modest dishes a chic name.
It has no foam cream, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently soaked the spoon in the brown mass that was on the plates.
Surprisingly, it was not so bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more cakes.
Listening to an experienced “economist,” he said to his wife, “A fine slice of crushed straw nuts.”
Gilead to get reimbursement for legal costs in battle with Merck for Hepatitis C patent
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to be reimbursed for the costs of the legal services it paid in the case of breach of the hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in a case for a £200 million fine for breaking two of Merck’s patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a U.S. federal judge found misconduct in Merck’s activities, such as lying after sworn in and other unethical activities.
During a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal costs incurred in defence in the case.
Merck is trying to gain market positions against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which are effective in 90% of liver disease cases.
The case was initiated in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead’s medicine.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken control of the city of Manbij from Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city of the last opponent fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages captured by militants, Sharf Darwish of the SDS-allied Manbij military council told Reuters.
"At the moment, the city is under our full control and we are searching for the fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton donated $1 million, mostly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million by acting as a speaker and the former secretary of state earned $3 million in revenue from her book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton’s election ally, U.S. Virginia senator Tim Keane and his wife Anna Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Keane continue to set new standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign partner, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various pretexts and excuses to avoid fulfilling his promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
“Your move,” Clinton’s campaign partner Ian Sams tweeted about the Democratic candidate’s tax information.
Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information until audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, say his resignation raises questions about his real amount of assets, donations and other business obligations, including his ties to Russia.
Clinton poured oil into the fire on Friday by publishing a video where several influential Republicans demand Trump to disclose his tax information.
She again came back to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: “He will refuse to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades.”
According to Politico, Trump has paid very little or no taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business column author said on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a key issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Warren Buffett’s proposal, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
During Clinton’s speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett urged Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump was afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has been publishing tax information until 2007.
Clintons now live in Chapappa, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for unlocking Israeli telephone code at an Arab request - RT News
A Jewish-born French filmmaker raised a storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code available.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentary about the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his disappointment with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli telephone code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was slaughtered and destroyed in 2016?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers calling to the country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman wrote that the answer he received “shocked him.”
The hotel manager explained that "this was a deliberate decision by the hotel management."
The reason for the removal of the code further sinked the film director.
“Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code,” Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsmann, called the incident a "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this happened precisely in Germany, in this hotel network, is even more humiliating.
Explanations are not needed.
The official said: “We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions.”
This event also gained a fairly widespread resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel is simply a good deal for Arab customers.
Another recorded "shame" stating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The newspaper Der Spiegel that the hotel itself quickly dismissed all the accusations, stating that it was all a "misunderstanding" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of countries," Kempinski told Suddeutsche Zeitung.
The code is added to the list again.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education reforms.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcers tried to drive out students, as a result of which police applied rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students demonstrated against the reform of the education system.
San Paolo Governor Geraldo Alckmin proposes closing 100 public schools and relocating 300,000 students to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators painted graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
The protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to support President Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skiners finishes first, bringing Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skiner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome last night. The British team defended its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Howe proud and marking the victory for New Zealand’s favourites.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprising victory when Hughes won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hugh had already ended his athletic career.
Problems were at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as he had to replace the experienced start specialist Jamie Staff.
They succeeded at the last moment.
When Hugh left, his place was sought to be filled by Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
The British coaches put hopes on Skiner, seeing in him the potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoye and Skiners, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the race started better for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus in their circle were in close up, Kenny stood in the lead, and the Skiners protected the lead.
The change in strategy played an important role in the victory as the Hindus ran with a larger gear to allow Kenya and especially the Skiner to drive faster.
Hugh watched the race as a BBC representative and grabbed the eyes of Skiner, Kenya, and Hindus as they climbed the honor pedestal.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said: “It was an inexpressible honour.”
I will do everything to defend my name.
In the final we set an Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes admits to intentionally falling off the track after a failed start.
He later refuted this comment and the British competitors were unable to prove the opposite.
There was no such incident this time.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the tribunes reminded me of London."
Over the last three months, we have become a solid team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will race for a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team’s progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat Hoya’s success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medals won. Furthermore, Kenya was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a holy date for the British, as on this day Steve Regreev, Mo Farah and Roger Banister are also born).
On this date was also born.
Kenya’s next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue over the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "I just enjoy it all right now.
Team travel is always the best.
You can win with your team members.
If honest, then winning one is a little lonely.”
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be placed in the Order of Knights."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it wasn’t the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clency, Steve Burke, and Owen Douls were the fastest qualifying times in the four-mile race.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be at the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip he had a disagreement with the police station when the judges called him to measure his height.
On the women’s ride, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joan Rovell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald from Milwaukee set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hopefully. will win medals in the mid-stage of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind-the-scenes has been different, after accusations of sexism and harassment of dignity, Technical Director Shane Saton resigned, and the career is also ended by Hughes and Victoria Bendleton.
But when the first cycling race begins, it seems that Britain will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Meltinghouse becomes uncertain due to an ambitious contract being broken.
The future of the aluminum melting plant and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, announced the termination of cooperation.
This announcement is based on the Victoria government’s plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue operating.
20 years of subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the alloy consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s entire electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesey power plant.
The Alcoa Portland alloy works with losses and may be closed.
These events were driven by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of the factory’s production.
The plant’s power supplier AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the joint venture Alcoa and Alumia, as well as the Chinese Citic and Japanese Marubeni Corp. holding companies.
AGL hopes for the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the melting plant,” said its representative.
AGL said the agreements are so-called “risk-restricting agreements” that are scheduled to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a duration of 12 months, so they will be in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in fiscal year 2017 as well,” the company’s spokesman said.
Starting from the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favorable market forecasts for future wholesale prices of electricity.
AGL says it has already recorded losses of $187 million in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa says the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue operations or supply energy to the melting plant.
The U.S. company says it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but it will be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland mill in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
AGL CEO Steven Mickelson said last week that analysts estimate that Portland will consume 600 megawatts of energy per year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants left the energy market, energy demand would decrease significantly.
And that’t be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 claims are rejected, and if the budget is reduced, the situation could worsen.
Three out of five people in Queensland – mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to fight illegal exile – are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The community’s legal center, which is already overwhelmed, warns that as funding drops, the situation will only get worse.
As of next year, these legal centers will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the National Association of Legal Centers’ latest report says that thousands of people in need are currently being denied legal assistance.
Mr Farel pointed out that if this decision is not revoked, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: “The Queensland Legal Center is constantly getting underfunded, which means that aid is being denied to thousands of people in need.”
People trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not get the necessary help.
Starting in June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning several thousand more Queensland residents will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately halt the funding cuts so that people in need of legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their clients and the Palazchuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign prosecuted for one of his employees pulling out a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign organizers have been sued in court for failing to react to information that its North Carolina operations chief opened fire on an employee when they were in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had waited for months for an internal investigation into the case, but realized that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Philip "pulled out the gun, placed his right index finger on the tail and turned the rod against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people have experienced the same.
"The weapons do not have to be fired in order to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican presidential candidate sparked a scandal by informing people that the “Second Amendment people,” i.e. weapons owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton won the election and she elected judges.
Trump’s campaign officials said the media had pulled his words out of context and that he had never incited anyone to violence.
Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, and from Filipsa for assault, illegal use of weapons and creating emotional stress.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Houpa Hix, did not immediately comment.
I was unable to contact Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
He also has not been able to call his consultancy "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition is the celebration of sport and sport.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered together for a sporting festival.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that the Lake Festival would no longer be held.
A new page has been broken.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time the competition was not in the traditional ways and too seriously taken, because, for example, the rifle had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the shoe flew, with the left hand thrown, "bumping" has not been at all in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, clever and reckless he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the open-air stadium where the celebration began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could take part in the inflatable attractions and gain a new image in the grimace of faces.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was the car parade, which attended both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone was addressed by the head of the district administration Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, who wished a nice rest and dry weather, but the rain did not cause much disturbance.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the young people.
It’s really good that the garden has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
Amateur art collectives from the Engures region had arrived with the performances, the viewers liked the performances of the senior dance group "Autumn's rhythms", the performers of different national dances "Redas" and the young dancers "Golden Pearls".
It’s not unlikely that someone on the wet scene has also slipped.
Of course, the local people and guests were delighted by the famous actor duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as Berzciem’s attractive wives from the fishermen’s set “Dieniņas”.
The ball was played by the group “Brujis”.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hitler.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also across the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in London in 2012, where we invested enormous work to ensure that all regions of the country benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Eysthenes won outright much from the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, create 40,000 new jobs and finally end youth unemployment in the Heathrow neighborhood.
As with the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people who will consider this challenge too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics on time and that it would be a worldwide failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and in the case of Heathrow they would not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits the whole society, not individuals.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has generated an infrastructure investment programme worth £11 billion in time and budget ranging from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years on site, to Terminal 2, which has been built between the two most intensely used runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be funded by private investments of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trade future and creating a new environment for employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former trade secretary of the Ministry of Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman finds herself on a highway while trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he landed on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when several cars struck her on the highway early on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in the canton of Vo.
A Vo Canton police report said the woman, desperately trying to commit suicide, had stumbled onto the road in the dark, where she was struck by several cars.
In an apparent attempt to commit suicide, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss, was struck by several cars, including a heavy car.
He died in the event.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others have not yet been identified, police say, which calls on the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched, which is a logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Genève.
It is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
Hofstellers added: “The prosecutor will find out.”
Two similar incidents that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, a pedestrian was on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a policewoman was justified for murder due to negligence when she drove a man who slept on the A1 road in the middle of the night near Paijern.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drunk and later noticed to fall asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on her way to the scene of the accident, was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the man lying on the road was "a completely unpredictable and extraordinary incident".
Anyone with information about the Thursday accident near Morges is advised to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are gathered on the Internet for a competition for the post of new CEO.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started to collect signatures for the competition for the new head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), stated that society wants a transparent and professional process of appointment of officials.
The petition was formed on 10 August, and it has now been signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating Ingas Kolegova for the post of Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is opaque and unprofessional.
It reminds us of the best traditions of Soviet officials.
This discredits public administration and once again makes the public disappointed in government and politicians.
“There is a need for a competition with clear criteria that all candidates should be evaluated against,” the petition reads.
Its author Janis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for choosing Kolegova for the position.
It is also unclear what the candidates intend to do.
The petition states that the State Chancellor should establish a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel training specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola last week officially nominated Kolegova for the post of head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this week in the government was scheduled to approve him in the new position, but all ministers of the party "Unity" voted against, so the question for a week was postponed.
If I lost, I played badly.
The beach volleyball players Aleksandr Samoilovs and Janis Šmēdiņš hoped for a prize in the Rio Olympics, however, not coming to it, there is no difference in which place to conclude the competition, after leaving the tournament said Samoilovs.
One of the world’s strongest beach volleyball pairs lost on Thursday in the final and decisive match of the subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to Brazilians Evandro Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado, ending their participation in the most important sports forum of the four years.
In three subgroup matches, the Latvian athletes won one win, but the same ratio was for two other pairs.
Furthermore, the ratio of small points between the three pairs was counted, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duet.
“We were in the lead in the first set, but from 16:15 we stayed on 16 points,” he recalled.
I don’t even know how we left the rest of the set without points.
It cannot play.
Then in the second set everything was fine and in the set final we broke the game, and that should also be a good basis for the third set.
We started the same way, but after changing sides, the result grew only for one team.
We made a lot of mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
“We should have played more like that, not give 3-4 points in a row,” said the athlete.
We knew that Evander could be emphasized.
“In the first set we managed to do it, in the second we put 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 he had already lost the game,” he recalled.
We tried to play the best game.
Sometimes it came, sometimes not.
I didn’t see the overall situation before the match, but I knew we needed as many points as possible.
“If we lost, then I played badly,” said Samoilov.
From Evandru we expected a good server and we did well in the first set, but in the third he opened a server and it was difficult to build an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes in the reception right at Pedro’s serving, but I had to deal with it.
Samolov said that unlike the previous match, today’s athletes were not nervous.
“We went, we played, the defense was too, but we needed a better serving,” said the athlete.
“They played well and eventually came to the top.”
We said before the tournament that the draw was the most uncomfortable that could have been.
We also had a chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"Everyone expected a medal from us and we from ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov had the third Olympic Games in his career in Rio, since in 2008 in Beijing he started with Martini Plavini, and four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
This was his second start at the Olympics.
Latvenergo also follows the process of opening the gas market as a potential trader.
The state-owned energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market both as a consumer and as a potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, press secretary of the company.
“The decision on whether Latvenergo will also join the gas market as a dealer in the future will be determined by the model of the gas market and the legal framework that will be established.”
“Therefore, on our part, we are actively involved in the creation and commentary of normative acts, as well as submitting our proposals,” Bider said.
The Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulation Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has drawn up a draft regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers "Rules of Commerce and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users the right to freely choose the natural gas dealer from 3 April 2017.
In working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and understandable as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "dealer-centric model" has been chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the dealer - one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the operator of the distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
After April 3, 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas dealer will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing dealer at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, traders will have to choose a natural gas dealer with whom to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement for a certain period of time, the natural gas traders will be provided with the natural gas trade by the existing natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The draft Cabinet Regulations detail the rights and obligations of natural gas distributors, system operators and users.
The Regulations determine the procedure in which natural gas is supplied to users and its supply is discontinued, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gas-based facility in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure in which payment of received services, the amount of delay interest, the procedure for changing trader and the supply of users in the event of disturbance of natural gas supply; the procedure in which natural gas supply to connected users is provided by the public trader.

The crew who went to call suffered a traffic accident and the man was detained by another crew.
A gas gun was found on the man.
It was that on Friday, in a hurry to call, a State Police (VP) car could have crashed into Riga centre.
The accident occurred while driving on a category A call or going to remedy a situation in which the health or life of a person is at risk.
However, in the corner of the street of Baron and Dzirnavu there was a collision with a car.
Next week will be discussed the raising of the general manager’s salary.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS)) plans to talk next week with Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about raising the salary of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of raising the salary of the Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to be addressed urgently in order to make the position more attractive to potential candidates for re-concours.
We will also discuss the change in the terms of the competition next week.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of a specific candidate to apply for a vacant position.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good director-general of the Ministry of Environment.
In the case of the current head of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs Daci Pelēko, who has expressed a willingness to apply for this position, the Minister has repeatedly expressed the opinion that the new Director-General of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs should have a "look from the edge" and should not come from the structure of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs.
She also stressed that she expects the Saeima to return from vacation in order to move the legislative amendments necessary for the reorganization of the VID as soon as possible.
The agency BNS has already that the head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has submitted to Finance Minister Dan Reizniece-Ozolai (ZZS) a request withdrawing her candidacy for the position of Director General of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs.
In the filing, she said it was not an easy choice, but her relatives have experienced severe emotional pressure over the past two weeks, despite not taking any action that could be condemned by law.
Kolegova also noted that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the conflict between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It is also that the former Director-General of the Ministry of Environment, Ināra Peterson, resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock indices in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the value of the U.S. dollar, are rising.
Global oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, positively influencing investors’ sentiment, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said, reinforcing expectations that the biggest oil producers will take action to stabilize the global oil market at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three major U.S. stock market indices reached a record high on Thursday, which has not been seen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise of European stock exchange indices.
The U.S. dollar rose against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen on Thursday.
In New York Stock Exchange e-commerce, the price of WTI brand crude oil for deliveries in September rose by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
Brent’s crude oil price for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange increased by $1.99 in October to $46.04 per barrel.
Conserve manufacturer Blue Lagoon’s turnover decreased by 33.8 percent last year.
Conserve manufacturer Blue Lagoon's turnover last year was €4.202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses fell 5.7 times - to €904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report says that in 2015 the company worked with losses incurred for a number of reasons, including due to the continued lack of circulating funds caused by Unicredit Bank’s departure from the Baltic market, interrupting the previous credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts unable to fulfil them.
As a result, the company did not have enough funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and get a volume discount.
The bank’s departure from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU structural fund support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial creators in the past year were negatively affected by rising commodity prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
“Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new – highest – prices,” the company’s management said.
Also in 2015, Blue Lagoon began negotiations with potential investors, including the evaluation of the company’s movable and real estate.
Investors have already been to the company’s largest lender, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes to greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of installations were purchased to provide a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of the Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company’s plant to fulfill such orders that were not possible before.
The first batch of production that will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the intention protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, all produced will be sold according to the intention protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros a month,” the company’s management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon sent its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its sales market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States in September this year.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon operated with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and a loss of EUR 5,113 million.
Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a capital of €1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals – Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirshon (10.89%).
Welcome to the 15th at the museum to attend the cinema duo Zaru Leander and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the beloved film diva Sarah Leander.
The meeting of Zara Lenderes with Crownmother Ruth, who was the lady of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 was fateful, because it was she who revealed to the woman of Zara Leander the unusual low contrast, which she attempted when she debuted on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Per precisely the accidental appearance in Riga became a fateful turning point on Zar’s creative path towards world fame.
Riga Zara Leander was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest shows, but unfortunately these expectations were not destined to come true, as the Second World War began.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the role of the outstanding Zara Leander will be felt by the great Ieva Kerēvica.

Traffic for other participants will be provided along the road - the scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants come to this festival, including pilgrims.
Therefore, motorists should be especially careful, as there will be intense pedestrian traffic on various highway routes in the direction of Aglon.
We urge drivers to be aware of the introduced traffic restrictions, to observe the order of traffic organization, as well as to count on the possible longer time spent on the road.
The water temperature in all water bodies dropped below +20 degrees.
With the cool weather, the water temperature continues to decline, and currently in all the rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea it is below +20 degrees, according to data from the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center.
In the sea, the water cooled to +16..+18 degrees, on the west coast of the Gulf of Riga, under the influence of the wind, the water temperature dropped to +13 degrees in some places, and in Rojo at times to +9 degrees.
In Bigup and Daugava, as well as in the large lakes, the water temperature is +18..+20 degrees, in other water bodies +14..+19 degrees.
A year ago, the water temperature in the rivers and lakes on 12 August reached +24..+25 degrees, the southern coast of the Gulf of Riga was up to +22 degrees warm water.

The man was unfamiliar to the girls, of white skin color and about 20 years old.
Kurdish activists occupy the building of the German public broadcaster.
A group of 30 Kurds seized the public broadcaster WDR building in Düsseldorf on Thursday night, where they held a two-hour demonstration, German police said.
Demonstrators, who came with posters taken with them, sang various slogans, trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was peaceful and protesters eventually voluntarily left the buildings at the request of employees.
The insurance company will pay compensation to passengers for flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance compensation to a family for a flight cancelled on Wednesday, August 10 at Riga Airport, which forced them to refuse to attend a planned music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to a flight cancellation at the airport on Wednesday, the client was charged a compensation for the reservation of accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the festival tickets purchased in the amount of 204 euros.
The airline has promised to reimburse the money spent on air tickets.
If Insurance has paid compensation for cancellation or cancellation of a trip on average in 15% of all travel insurance benefits.
“These times, the costs of purchasing, returning or exchanging tickets, as well as booking accommodation are reimbursed,” says Dagnija Rutka, Product Manager for Insurance of Insured Persons at If.
As is known, on the evening of 10 August, a private plane stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, so only canceled several departing flights, but several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
Due to a neighbor’s repair, a man gets to the broken ceiling and is forced to leave the house.
In the LTV show "Studio 4" appealed Dmitry Saidyašev, whose neighbor has begun capital repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has broken a patch from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors did an arbitrary construction and there are damaged ceilings in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga construction board, the house manager and other organizations.
The building management said we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
“The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there,” says Dmitri.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what happened and acknowledged that the cover is in an unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the construction board, and until the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether the location in the apartment was not life-threatening.
In the building council said - this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga Dome, but they transferred the house to the administrator, then the administrator again to the building board, and then there is a clutter," says Dmitry.
After examining the entire pile of paper, it is clear that the construction works have been stopped, although from time to time you can hear that someone is working there.
Within two months, an expert examination should be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment, who carries out repairs, all these defects should be removed.
The independent expert has drafted his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert did not specify whether the metal grid in this carrying structure was affected, therefore there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is posing a danger.
“That is why we have requested additional explanations from this expert,” says Ilze Žūka, a representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction is continuing.
The fine for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in the specific case the penalty can be much harder.
While waiting for an expert opinion, the construction board has decided that both the apartments should not be operated - both the one where the construction works are taking place and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the construction administration, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have posed a danger not only to their property, but also to the owner of the underlying property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit their property," says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry has to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But the losses Dmitry may attempt to collect from his neighbor in civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, staying in both apartments is currently prohibited until the engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait even three weeks.
The damages will be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repair was carried out.
The owner of this apartment, for not taking into account the statements of the construction board, is also threatened with a prison sentence of up to six months.
Think of it!

The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" will cost 22 million euros, says Gita Želve, a representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Kemeri".
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former sanatorium in Kemeru.
The second phase will be a wellness clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Turtle notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she notes that it will be located in the building of the former Kemer resort polyclinic, which covers an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
“Park Hotel Ķemeri” and the planned clinic are owned by the international fund “G Capital Europe”, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund.
George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier that a total investment of more than 30 million euros is planned to be between 12 and 15 million euros in the construction of the former resort polyclinic.
In the restoration of the cultural and historical park of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of access roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive natural tourist object, the repair of the territory and the construction of a parking lot on Emily Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jūrmal and the increase of the number of tourists, the Jūrmal Council plans to raise from European Union funds 14,5 million euros, co-financed by three to four million euros.
Planning works are scheduled for mid-2017, but construction and repair work will begin in the autumn of next year.
As, the historic sanatorium complex "Kemeri" is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and a "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction is lengthy.
In the 2010 report, it was also stated that Ominasis is constantly communicating with hotel operator Kempinski, who continues to provide daily technical control in the Kemeri sanatorium, and already in 2011 will be "complete the reconstruction of the upcoming Kemeri hotel" and immediately start preparatory works for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Ķemeri confirmed its willingness to purchase a set of property belonging to the insolvent “Ominasis Latvia” in Kemeru sanatorium at an auction, but a month later the auction was recognized as not taking place, because the winner did not pay for the purchase at the specified time.
The sale price was determined according to the initial price of the last unsuccessful auction – 2.86 million euros.
Ieva Aile, a representative of the city council, informed LETA that the municipality, signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union structural funds, it will repair the adjacent infrastructure - it will restore the historic Kemeru park, create an interactive natural tourism facility, repair roads and parking spaces.
The President will award the opera singer Antonenko the Order of the Three Stars.
President Raimonds Vējonis will hand over the Order of the Three Stars class III to Alexander Antonenko next week, according to the presidential agenda.
The award ceremony of the Order of the Three Stars will take place at the Blackbeard House at 13.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Jozef Mediński College of Music in 1998, where he studied blowing instruments and learned singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Division of the Latvian Academy of Music of Jāzepa Vītola in Arvīda Lustes class.
In 1997 he began singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F. Hendel’s opera “Alchin”.
He was awarded the 2003 Grand Prix of Music for vocal performance in opera and Verdi’s Recommendation.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, engaged by the largest operas in the world.
Since the fall of 2004, he has sung at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Dresden Semperoper, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Dusseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in Nar.
In 2011, Antoinenko with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra sang the title of "Otello" in the Paris Opera, in the Covent Garden Opera he sang Luigi in the New Study of "The Garment", and also participated in the "Girl from the West" performed by Christopher Lois in Stockholm.
A year later, Antonenko sang with great success the role of Otello in the London Covent Garden Opera.
Former NATO commander Bridlov’s email was hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers may have carried out several other cyber attacks, including the emails of former NATO European forces commander Philip Bridlov and the servers of the George Soros Open Society Institute, Bloomberg on Thursday.
The hackers published the information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there was also a Bridlov list and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
The hackers had access to the institute’s computers for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with the Russian intelligence services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose the sanctions, the administration will have to officially accuse Russia or Russian authorities-backed hackers of cyberattacks on the Democratic Party’s servers.
WikiLeaksly published about 20,000 emails from the DNC computer system in July, suggesting that Democratic leaders sought to harm Hillary Clinton’s former rival Vermont senator Bernie Sanders’ campaign for a Democratic presidential nomination.
According to U.S. media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the hacking of Democratic servers, and other U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack is almost undeniable.
McCartney: Joko Ono’s presence threatened The Beatles.
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currentlyins a "good" relationship with the widow of the unhappy John Lennon, but at the time she went to the band to visit the recording studio, McCartney was frightened because Ono was the only woman among the band members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They are really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do this, but not very successfully because we were very tense.
We weren’t sexists, but the girls didn’t usually come to the recording studio, they allowed us to act.
When John started meeting Joko, she wasn’t sitting in the control room, but in the middle of us four.
The author of Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he is now in regular contact with former band member Ringo, and occasionally confirms the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise The Beatles have "stopped working".
Asked if he was still meeting the legendary rock band’s other only surviving member, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine, “Sometimes not.”
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t go to meetings, I feel a little distracted from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
Instead, I sent John Eastman to meetings and said, “Let me know what everyone is saying, because I can’t stand sitting at that table.”
It was too painful to see your pet die.
The company now works so that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Research Institute have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon, has ever had conditions similar to Earth.
Scientists have previously speculated that the slow rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a flat, Earth-like atmosphere and that it rotated slowly.
The model also looks at the earlier topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to form life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a GISS model simulation, the rotating model of Venus reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes the matter, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as a rainbow, protecting the planet from solar heat.
As a result, a temperate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the garlands were burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water completely evaporated, only a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas remained – Venus as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado's Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed a resignation as a reason for mentioning insufficient influence on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President and General Manager Joe Sack confirmed the news and informed that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have been vigorous, enthusiastic and dedicated to my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Colorado Hockey Operations,” Roy said in a statement.
During this summer, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team’s performance to give it the brilliance it needs and higher-level results.
To this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully match the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions that relate to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league’s best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the elimination games the Colorado team was defeated by Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not entered the elimination games for two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team, failing to win the second special invitation of the Western Conference organizers.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy has won four Stanley Cups in his career – two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers’ strikes over the salaries of North Sea oil platform workers have been postponed as the two parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders said.
Periodically, strikes against the oil processing company Wood Group are held on the North Sea oil platforms where Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement said Wood Group and Unite and RMT agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examining problematic issues.
The unions said their recent events, organized after a break of more than 25 years, were aimed at a planned 30 percent reduction in wages.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group has cut salaries for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market decline.
Shell has already cut salaries to several thousand people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
Nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiadian constellation.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive catalogue of the speed of rotation of stars in the Plejadic constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, and how the speed of star rotation can be attributed to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more insight into the relationship between the masses of the stars, their age and even the history of their solar system,” said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at the Caltech Infrared Process and Analysis Center at Pasadena.
The Plejad constellation is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to rise, reaching about 125 million years of age.
It rotates at maximum speed.
At their maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When winds enter the star's magnetic field, they brake the stars.
As stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable region of the star, such as a sunspot.
The latest catalogue of the speed of rotation of stars shows that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, larger dancers perform pyrues slower than small dancers.
Rebul says that the Pleiadian ballet shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to its close proximity, the Plejadic constellation serves as a great space laboratory where the characteristics of the stars can be compared to the speed of rotation.
Rebul says that the Plejadic constellation helps to build theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down, and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues detailed the analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plejadic stars in three new publications that will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
