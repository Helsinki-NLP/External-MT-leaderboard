Parliamentarians are concerned about the issue of 'looking like fools'
There is confusion among Members of Parliament some have the view that their head should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been the result of a proposal to change the name of the convention to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Parliament of various political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour Member of Parliament said his party was concerned that it "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means original and pwp means hammer.
A Plaid Party Member of Parliament said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and would take other measures.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open to other ideas" about the name change, but he noted that it was a shortened version of MWP to Muppet.
In this case in Welsh w is pronounced the same as the pronunciation of the symbol u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to establish the name, said: "The final decision on the nomination of Members of Parliament is a matter for those members to consider".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public inquiry where it found that the public was in favour of the decision to change the name of the building to the Parliament of Wales.
In the case of the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP's decision received a lot of support in public debate.
AMs appear to be making further decisions, but struggling to reach a consensus could be a major challenge for the Director, Elin Jones, who is expected to issue an unconfirmed order on the change within weeks.
The bill also includes other changes to the way the legislature operates, including legislation to remove Members of Parliament and the composition of committees.
The members of the Parliament will vote on the name of the building after the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country
Voting on Sunday will change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A popular vote was held to resolve the centuries-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has argued that the name of its northern neighbors represents the meaning of the region's ownership and has repeatedly refused to support its request for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change proposal, said he would not vote.
However, those who want the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is the cost of joining the EU and NATO
St. Martin's Bells Silent Because of the Troubles in Harlem
From historical perspective, the adults I spoke to say there were bars and a church everywhere", Mr. Adams said.
"Now, that's not the case".
He also said that the lack of a bar was reasonable.
"People have different social attitudes" today, he said.
"A bar is not a dining room where people go often".
Regarding the congregations, they are concerned that the cost of goods sales will not be as long as the leaders expected, "and they will soon return to their original position".
He added that churches could be replaced by tall buildings with sections filled with humanity that could not support the remaining nearby shrines.
"Most of the people who will buy the new buildings are white", he said, "and that is why it is speeding up the closing date for these churches together because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the building will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the Western Congregation before Harlem became a black city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist church left in the 1930's.
A black congregation worshiping nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a raid on merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but after Mr. Johnson's followers rebuilt the building, several bells were installed.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Mr. Johnson and a follower at St. Martin's, proudly called the installed bells "bells of the poor".
A scholar who blew the bell in July called something: "Cultural economy" and "a constant historical tool".
The scholar, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also says that these were the world's first bells to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church's main bell tower 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martin's has not taken their place.
The events at St. Martin's in recent months have been a hot topic for architects and contractors, some brought by lay ecclesiastical leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
A regular churchgoing group called - the parish governing body, made up of lay clergy - wrote the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "requires a regular churchgoing group to pay for the expenses", although the regular churchgoers did not participate in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent to work on the project.
Some of these regular churchgoers complain that the diocese is not open.
A 13-year-old swimmer in California was injured by a shark
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while swimming in California on the first day of the swim, officials said.
The plot took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing a swimming game with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then got up with a group to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought I was just holding a frog, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I've been bitten!
I'm bitten!'
Her shoulder was torn apart", Hammel said, "and she realized that as soon as she got there with the boy.
"I called out to everyone: 'Water has a shark!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was admitted to the intensive care unit.
The species of shark that injured him remained unknown.
Marine Corps Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed not of a harmful species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the ground.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours to investigate and develop local safety measures.
Giles estimates that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most do not appear to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to open a jewellery store in the UK market
Sainbury's will compete with other retailers such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams who own stores with sections and luxury shelves with other professional support.
As part of a major move towards a $2.8bn UK jewellery market, which continues to grow as the clothing and home goods market recedes, a large, door-to-door luxury store will be tested in 11 stores across the country and moved to other stores next year if it proves to be successful.
The idea of entering the jewelry business came as supermarkets were looking for ways to use the shelves used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it could double the size of the jewelry items to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have a number of branded stores that are similar to those found in shops like Boots.
This supermarket is also launching a cosmetics store so that many products are tailored to non-meat eaters - something that young shoppers are keen on.
In addition, the fragrance shop will attempt to sell in two Sainburys stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the daily shopping pattern of small-scale food in nearby stores means that stores need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainbury's, says the store will look like a department store with a number of branches as the supermarket with many branches tries to counter the low-cost Aldi store and Lidl offering more than just food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos's stores in hundreds of stores and has also launched a number of residential properties since it bought two branches two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made the sale more profitable.
The store's recent attempt to renovate its jewelry and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over who would distribute the money from drugstores to its supermarkets.
The new approach came after Sainsbury sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy chain, for $125m, three years ago.
He also said Lloyd should take part in the project, adding several skin care products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a sales manager at Sainbury, said: "We have altered the look and feel of our beautiful gates to make the shopping area more attractive.
We have also spent a lot of money on our well-trained friends who will be there to give advice.
Our product lines have been designed to meet every need with beautiful scenery and simple environments to the point that they mean that we are now a fascinating place that challenges the old shopping method".
Peter Jones was 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's departure from a $11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left 'angry' by the departure of TV presenter Holly Willoughby on a £11million deal for the brand of his high-quality advertising business to manage his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to run their Truly business selling home furnishings and other items.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model.
The 37-year-old This Morning host went on Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones of Dragon Den's talent angry at leaving a marketing business partnership with a very high return on investment at the last minute - to oversee her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "was upset when the talented TV actress admitted at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth £1.5 million - meant that she had no time to run their Truly home-made clothing and accessories business.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model and was suggested to have doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
At the time Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and left Britain for his other vacation home.
The source said: Truly it was a key part of Holly's priorities.
This was his long-term future that would keep him busy for decades to come.
Her exit thought left everyone involved in shock.
No one would believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of goods that is ready for sale at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most trusted technicians, could cost the business millions of dollars due to the overspending on consumer products such as household items and clothing, and the potential for a slow start-up.
And it can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as a co-chair in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S' ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We can't say anything about his business".
The main theme is "before we loved one another"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the press for commenting on what others might consider "leadershipless" and confident of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump spoke in the words of his derogatory "reader".
"I gave nothing . . ".
He also said Kim wants to attend the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step in North Korea's nuclear arms embargo.
But discussions on the prohibition of nuclear weapons have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean governor-general Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "similar action" from the U.S. as North Korea had previously done in arms embargoes.
Rather, he said, the U.S. continues to impose enforced penalties.
Trump had high hopes for the speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a better relationship".
He also noted that their efforts to build a good relationship with Kim have yielded positive results - halting rocket testing, leading to the release of prisoners and the return of U.S. troops.
And he justified his strange approach by talking about friendship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the hall, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and kill millions
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national disaster was reported, which is necessary since international aid is needed.
"Often, unfortunately, it is obvious that they are not seeking help from other countries, so it is a bit of a challenge", said Sister Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a group to move to Palu, it is unclear whether these foreign workers will be allowed to work.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for disaster relief, said Indonesian officials are testing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to provide relief.
Despite the many earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not well prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami houses have been built in Aceh, these are unusual on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning had already been issued, must have contributed to the loss of life.
During these times, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A medical Ngarawa stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive when the new disaster strikes.
President Joko Widodo has urged Indonesia's infrastructure improvement to be a key part of the election campaign, and has donated substantial funds to roads and railways
But the financial crisis has affected Joko's government so much that he is due to be re-elected next year.
Joko is also facing hardships from religious unrest in Indonesia, where many Muslims have adopted a monotheistic approach.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes as Christian and Muslim militants fight in the streets, using spears, arrows, and other futile weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player scored the same goal in the penalty shoot-out.
The player saved Liverpool from the threat of a 89-minute game against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge who was 30 blocks from Chelsea's goal got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri as his team was left with a goal 1 to 0.
He moved the ball to the left and then pulled the bomb that his ball hit the far side of Sturridge.
The ball rose upward and went straight to the top corner of the net.
The ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who had thrown himself, and entered the net.
It was a struggle to get in the right place and get the ball and players like Shaqiri push the ball forward often, so I tried to make the most of myself said Sturridge in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I hit the ball once and then pulled the bomb twice without thinking".
Chelsea take a 1-0 lead in the first half after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through Belgium's Edin Hazard.
The forward for Chelsea transferred the ball to Kovacic with a heel in the middle of the court and then turned and ran into the Liverpool team's half.
Kovacic passed the ball to his fellow player who returned it to him in the middle of the court.
He then gave a good ball that led Hazard into a public box at Liverpool.
Hazard outperformed the hinders behind Liverpool and with his left leg hit a ball that passed Alisson Becker and entered the goal on the far side of Hazard's.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Saturday.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the ruins of structures destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
Palu, a city of more than 380,000 people, was filled with rubble from damaged buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman
An inquest into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged the local people who see or hear anything to come.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is still early but I would have asked anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can take anything from the dashcam to contact us because they could have the same keywords as our search.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found to be from Birkenhead and was found inside the house.
This evening, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where they had been this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are reportedly working hard to alert the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his home, but police say no one is allowed in or out.
He was shocked to learn what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours for them to be allowed back into their homes.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the entire area was being turned into a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He went on to say that it was 'too bad'.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the courtyard and another car was outside.
Several officers had stood inside the courtyard inspecting the building sections.
Anyone who is aware of the incident is requested to send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers by private at 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament serves as a final reminder of the 'try to rewrite history
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of much of England's moral and religious life by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's views as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current dispute over the removal of the statues that the subject of Oliver Cromwell's shadow outside the Palace of Westminster should not be discussed.
The depiction of the English Civil War was not commissioned or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps this guilty Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his grandfather Thomas had done a century earlier.
The beautiful Cromwell representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century ideology and another piece of human history that many believe is still to be admired.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more especially in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary champion against foreign pressure, in his case of the monarch.
Whether this is a complete demonstration is that this ancient controversy continues.
The fact is that the middle-seventieth-century conflict has changed the development of our country, and Cromwell is a well-known figure representing one side of the landscape.
His role as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering".
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by a pig
A farmer was bitten and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan", was found dead of a ruptured artery, bloody near a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He said that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
Early in the morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door of a nearby pig house open.
He said that in the house of the pig there was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and curved", said the streetwalker, nicknamed "Wu", as Guiyang Evening News explains.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the flea was locked up and protected from anyone else's clutches, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market officials are reportedly discussing how to pay for his death.
Although rare, reports of human harm to pigs exist.
In 2016, a pig injured a mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig slammed a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the fly.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not cruel but that the taste of blood can be "the cause".
"It's just a game.
They are like children, curious ... not wanting to hurt you.
You should give them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the storm Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa is bringing flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane, beginning at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located about 385 miles (385 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is being launched in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward into the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the island of Baja California on Monday as a hurricane begins to push moisture into the northeastern U.S.
Rosa will bring about about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterward, the humidity associated with the cold winds could bring more rain to the southwest in the coming days.
In the area, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause flooding, landfills, and landslides.
The extreme humidity causes rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
About two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding can be caused by the deterioration of the environment as rain falls in tropical areas.
It can be dangerous to travel in the wilderness under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn small rivers into large rivers of heavy water and thunderstorms can bring storms and dust.
A cold, approaching wind will cause heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
More than half an inch of rain can fall, causing small debris and roadside debris
This will be the first rainfall in the region during their rainy season.
Tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Tuesday and finish falling on Wednesday.
October can be a different time of year across the US as the Arctic begins to cool down, but in the tropics it will remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to a change in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of the variation in temperature in different parts of the US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the temperature of the planet is trying to rise again.
Most of the Central and Eastern US is expected to see an 80 degree spread from the Southern Plains to other parts of the Northeast beginning in October.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above normal city temperatures.
Our long-term weather forecast shows the potential for a higher temperature in the eastern U.S. in the first quarter of October.
More than 20 million people watched the debate on the Brett Kavanaugh case
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, testify Thursday with Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political conflict continues, while the media is disrupting the regular program on the Friday last minute segment: a news program organized by Sen. Arizona Fl Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was caught drunk and tried to undress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a kind testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It appears that more than 20.4 million people as Nielsen reported on Friday saw this happen.
The company was counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Some statistics were not immediately available on other networks that aired the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble getting office-based viewership figures.
To illustrate this, the size of the audience is similar to that of a football game or a Graduate Ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which has its own television host who strongly supports Kavanaughled's nomination, surpassed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day of broadcast, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest in ending the matter remained high.
Flake was a key player in Friday's events.
After the Republican central office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning screaming at the opposition as they tried to get on a trailer to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
She had stood her face facing down for a few minutes in shame, on the CNN television station.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the world the truth?
She was told, "You have power whereas most women have no power".
Flake said the office had issued a notice and said that before the carrier was closed, he would have much to say at the committee meeting.
The Internet and all the television stations were broadcasting the story at once in the following hours, while the Judiciary Committee had to vote to approve Kavanaugh's election to the full Senate to vote
But Flake said he would do so if he understood what the FBI would release in the next week's investigation into the alleged candidate, which a few Democrats were promoting.
Flake agreed to it in a small interview with his colleague, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was powerful, because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes in favor of Kavanaugh without a poll.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate cases involving Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has denounced the opposition as 'playing politics' with the Brexit issue
British Prime Minister Theresa May denounced opponents of her decision to leave the European Union as "playing a political role" with Britain's future and disrupting national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In an interview near the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to challenge his plan known as the UK's Future in Brexit, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU receiving each other's money was "unfounded"."
Wayde Sims shot dead: Dyteon Simpson arrested by police on suspicion of killing an LSU player
Police arrest a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for a second murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Simpson fight, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on those glasses, according to reports the WAFB has a partnership with CBS.
When Simpson was questioned, the police said he agreed to shoot Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the prosecutor said.
The Coroner's Office in East Baton Rouge Parish released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the local community for their support in the investigation that led to their arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "hard work and adherence to fairness".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-6-year-old player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano releases ash from Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Agency warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it erupted again in the valley and recorded 183 gas and ash for 24 hours.
The organization was making sure that there were no murmurs and quakes in the area.
The footage on the video shows a small amount of ash covering the car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Astronomers have observed an increase in volcanic activity in a volcano 72 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcanic eruption known as "Don Goyo" has been going on since 1994.
Police fight Catalan separatists before the day of voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a clash between anti-riot police and activists, and as thousands joined the clash to mark the anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
A group of masked protesters banned by anti-riot police threw eggs at them and painted them powder, creating black and dusty clouds in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The violence erupted again in the afternoon with the police using their staffs to end the fighting.
For several hours the independence groups singing "Don't Forget, No Forgiveness" met with the union's opponents shouting, "Live in Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the riots, local media reported.
Security threats remain in the autonomous community a year after the October 1 election which was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by the Catalan autonomous community.
Voters voted heavily for independence, even those opposed to secession did not come in large numbers and especially did not go to the polls.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to block the election in the provincial polling stations and trigger riots.
Independent groups set up camps and spent Friday night to prevent protesters from committing acts of violence in support of the country's police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take place in a different way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participates in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer believes Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year was a very good year.
I saw my parents cry joyfully at the opportunity to vote but now we're back", she said.
Despite achieving a modest victory in the local elections last December, Catalan independence parties have been struggling to get to work this year with their most prominent leaders either in solitary confinement or in prison awaiting trial for allowing elections and declaring their independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests in collaboration with the police on her phone, said the clash was politically motivated on both sides.
"It's getting more dangerous", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been in prison before being sentenced since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate in European elections is one of the best ways to strengthen the anti-democratic and oppressive work we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men hit houses and cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was repeatedly hit in a house in Londonderry.
This occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred to the doors and the building.
A bow can also be thrown at a car at a later time.
Menga's goal scored a 1-0 win over Rangers against Livingstone.
Dolly Menga's first goal made the Livingstone team a success.
Livingston's motivated team surprised the Rangers team and caused Steven Gerrard to lose a second time in 18 games as club manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal tied Gary Holt's team to Ireland in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain the winner of the Premier League this season, and next Sunday they will face the highest-scoring Hearts, who are also eight points behind.
Prior to the match, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is adding the team's winning streak to six games, and team captain Holt has been undefeated since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team misses a chance against the incoming visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead before the goal was scored, with their improvement in the ball causing problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got a chance but failed to score in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow just tried his hand at the move to face Craig Halket's head football near the gate.
The goalkeepers were content to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could harass the visitors with the flickers.
This is how this most important yoke came about.
The Rangers team made a mistake and started a foul and the Livingston team took advantage, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson handed each other the ball and found Menga, who touched the ball in the middle of the box and scored the goal.
The Rangers were the most conservative team at the time, but found that the goalkeepers of the home team were not easy to get into and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not injured.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos showed a man blocking Kelly's ball.
Scott Pittman's ball was hit by the foot of Ranger Allan McGregor's goalkeeper and Lithgow failed to score on the Livingstone team's goal.
Cross balls always entered Livingston's box and were continuously removed, while two penalty requests were denied - after Halkett's mistakes against the replacement Glenn Middleton, and another error in the ball capture.
'Amazing' from the Livingston team - according to one viewer
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Good play and amazing results for the Livingston team.
For me, they have played much better, than we would expect from this progressive victory.
He hasn't changed his playing style and his players have since then been more successful than all the teams, but the greatest honour should go to Mr. Holt in the way he has helped the team since he arrived.
He had many talented players.
Halkett was the team's captain, encouraging his well-organized defenders, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Rangers team was not encouraged, however.
It failed to meet the standards it had at times under Gerrard's direction.
Their last game was not good - they only got a chance to try out against the home team - and it's a surprise for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the league standings.
Erdogan is received in Cologne in a variety of ways
It was a smiling and cheerful Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO members.
He debated issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to officially open a new high mosque.
The majority of the Turkish population lives outside the country.
The police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - many of them Kurds - also voiced their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-part exhibition reflects the divided public opinion about this foreigner whom some German Turks view as a hero and a ruthless enemy to others.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The drivers stopped and emergency responders tried to provide medical assistance, but the man died instantly.
The accident comes months after a cyclist died in a Childers Street accident, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The City Police said they were working to identify the man and alert his family.
Road closures and bus jams are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid these areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot
Six officers have been injured in a riot at a maximum security prison for men, the Bureau of Prisons has said.
The demonstration began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
"Tornado" experts have been brought in to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and takes place in one area.
The officers received medical treatment after a minor eye injury.
"Well-trained prison staff have been sent to deal with the situation at HMP Long Lartin", said a prison spokesman.
Six workers have been rescued from injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be sent to the police and could spend long periods in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous in the country.
In June it became known that the prison warden had received medical treatment after being arrested by a prisoner.
And in October last year the police were called to the prison to deal with a major riot when their staff were beaten with balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening to Destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Flood (Drops Can Benefit)
It is unlikely that a hurricane will hit Arizona, but that is what should happen early next week as the strength of the remaining Tropical Storm Rosa will cross the Western Desert, posing a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a detailed flood risk assessment on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday, and again on Monday late in the rain.
The International Meteorological Commission in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that "only ten hurricanes have remained with tropical or tropical winds within Phoenix of a 200-mile radius since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck 40 miles [40 km] across the AZ border".
Recent images from the World Hurricane Administration show 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with rainfall in various places reaching 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Some areas of the Western Desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin can be 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of waterfalls in different areas of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, Rosa rainfall can be a blessing as the area faces drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some rainfall can be beneficial since the Southwest is facing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-largest category, "weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides in the Mexican state of Baja California.
Rosa, still a strong storm on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles (385 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is hitting the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing its strength.
So, it is expected to fall in Mexico during a storm surge on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a risk of flooding in the area.
"A rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible drop of up to 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a hurricane before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, which will follow through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The most anticipated threat from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
This flood is expected to cause severe flooding, a large amount of waste flowing through the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old father were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy after being found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was "well-heeled".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old father were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have asked anyone with videos of the incident to come.
Trump says Kavanaugh "encountered, cruelty, anger" from the Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote against the brutal and dangerous policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has faced, at the same time, the brutality, anger of the Democratic Party throughout his term.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and brutally denying the accusations of rape by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified.
On Saturday the president said "the American people saw Kavanaugh's talent and courage" that same day.
The vote to approve Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to approve one of the most successful lawyers of our time, the judge with the best record for public service", he told a crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The president mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the need for a positive outcome for Republican Party supporters in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important decisions of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm running a lot", he said.
"That is why I am everywhere fighting for the right candidates".
Trump said the Democrats are "against the ban".
The first major step in the voting process for Senate members for Kavanaugh's election is expected to take place before Friday, a GOP senior aide told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia are on the rise
More than 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by waves that hit the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, government officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu Friday when a 6 meter (18 foot) high wave broke through the beach in the evening and swept many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still working on the ground and did not run away, and they were affected", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, logs, houses, and carried everything out", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were relocated to 24 places in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges broken and damaged and a mosque surrounded by water.
The seismic activity continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Several earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) also estimated that the magnitude of the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location is at the end of a long, narrow harbor, and that has increased the spread of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "major" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed houses, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are unknown.
Nugroho said the damage could be severe in the 300-km (190 miles) northern coast of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication methods were "totally affected and there was little information about the situation" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there", said the Red Cross, adding that staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
It's already a problem, but it can grow, it said.
On Saturday the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the tides came at the time the warning was issued.
In an unverified video shared on social media, a father can be heard on the roof of a house shouting to warn people on the street floor that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes a wall of water collapsed on the beach, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that rendered communications ineffective and made it difficult for governments to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military aircraft have begun to send cargo and supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials have said, but survivors still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport had been opened to serve the self-service needs of the city and would be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the rescue centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It is very bad.
While World Vision personnel from Donggala have successfully reached the city of Palu, where workers live in wooden bags installed on their office yard, they arrived with damaged areas on their way, Mr. Doseba says.
He told me that he had seen many damaged houses", she said.
It is terrible.
While aid groups began to prepare to provide assistance, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being banned from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign money, donations, and labor only begin to flow when a national disaster is declared.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we can call for help from other countries but no such information has been provided at this time".
The second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing had the hope that their loved ones would return like miracles never before in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was carried out of the toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been locked under the rubbish for two days with her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in parachute flying, had trained two of the missing players in the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those locked up at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a parachute skier, I have my own concerns", he said.
Mr Gendon also related how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse spread to a group of parachute-flying athletes, he tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu athletes, who are taking part in a beach party.
His messages, however, only produced one white mark, instead of the two blue ones.
I think it means that the messages did not arrive", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while a car leaves cash in a cash machine at a restaurant and tourist attraction in Newport
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, $26,750 was stolen Friday morning when the car left the cash machine at a restaurant and tourist attraction in Newport.
The drivers leave the cash machine in the entertainment hall and plan to leave more money, notes Detective Dennis McCarthy in his report.
While the driver was distracted, a man passed behind a Brink worker and stole a purse of money that the driver had to leave somewhere.
Witnesses reported seeing several people flee the scene, but the police did not say how many.
If you have any information about the attack, call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changed his name to Ye
Musician Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth studio album, which was released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show who quit "for reasons of disagreement", said the show's producer.
Besides being a shortened form of his professional name, West said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It came from Kanye, meaning the only one, the only one to Ye - just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, all of it.
This album is a clear reflection of who we are".
He is one of the most famous musicians to change names.
Sean Combs is better known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for love titles like Love and Brother Love.
Former West ally JAY-Z also announced that his name could be pronounced there with a line or without.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the mass shooting.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
The military shot students at a peaceful demonstration on the stadium on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people during the time when school activists were based in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to those who attend and opening many free public universities.
He also noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to become involved in organized crime.
The U.S. government raises the price of a human-like machine
As China advances in human-computer technology, America needs to increase its spending on research in this field, says businessman and technology advocate Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This has led to many U.S. government agencies announcing that they will use the technology, while the country has no effective AI policy.
China has already launched the initiative last year: it wants to be No. 1 in the world by 2030.
"Raising research funding would be a good start, given that all countries are far behind the U.S., and we need to find jobs that are more advanced in this field", Lee said.
The additional funding could double the chances of AI-related successes happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a Chinese venture capital firm that has invested heavily in research into human-powered machines, Face++.
In the 1980's, the Carnegie Mellon University executive designed a machine that defeated the actor Othello and later became Microsoft's Research Director and head of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge for its launch and wanted to know when the competition would be held again to help identify the next generation of technologists.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government awards, Lee said.
"It's not China that is hiring educated people; it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other companies have been hiring university experts to work on AI projects in recent years.
Lee said that the change in immigration policies could also help the U.S. to strengthen its AI projects.
"I think that those with PhD degrees in mechanical engineering should be granted American citizenship.
China launched its Automated Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to schools in the same way that the National Natural Science Foundation and other government agencies do to researchers in the United States, but Chinese education is limited, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to include employees in industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced $2 billion in investment in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently spends over $100 million a year on AI research.
While the National Security Commission puts in $100 million a year for the development of the Human-like Machine.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The vote on Sunday was a vote to decide whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would have triggered a global dispute with Greece over its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents its ownership of the territory and has therefore refused to register Macedonia as a member of NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments agreed to change the name of Macedonia, but cultural activists have denied this, saying that the change in name is a derogatory view of the great Macedonian culture and history.
The country's leader, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that the vote is not taken and that the lack of a majority has created a risk that the voters may not reach half the population to approve the vote.
The question in the referendum was: "Do you want us to become members of NATO and the EU in line with our alliance with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a difficult but necessary move to allow the country to become a member of the EU and NATO, and to withdraw from the former Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote to prepare the future of our country, the future of young people in Macedonia to live freely as members of the European Union because this means that all people will live without fear", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
Although it is not legal, most members of parliament have said they have agreed to the results of the vote to make a valid decision.
The name change will need to be approved by two-thirds of the members of the legislature.
The country's election commission said there were no problems by 1 p.m.
However, 16 percent of the electorate voted, compared with 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections for registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, for us Europeans", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the election in Macedonia by changing the country's name which would open the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018
In the parliament in the city of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov repairs the youth tower and sets up a tent in front of tents set up by the opposition.
"We want to be members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with a clear mind, which is not through coercion", said Mr. Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, yes, but we are honored.
If they do not want us to become members like Macedonia, we can register membership for other organizations such as Russia and China such as the Euro-Asia".
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a NATO member would boost trade in Macedonia, which also has the highest unemployment rate.
"I hope that many will be prejudiced because more than 80 percent of our citizens favor the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a vote for ya would be the key to our future".
A poll released Monday by the country's Institute for Policy Research showed that about 30 to 43 percent of the general public would participate in the vote - a figure below the expected attendance rate.
A news conference on Telma TV showed that 57 percent of those interviewed would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of respondents said they would vote in favor of changing the country's name.
To be successful, the election requires 50 percent of the vote, including one vote.
The rejection of this idea is the first failure of the European Union to take the leadership in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero crosses the barriers behind Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the barrier behind the Brighton team as Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem as simple as possible when he hit 65 minutes.
The Argentine forward received the ball in the middle of the field early.
He ran the ball with him and hit three blockers back and then got a chance.
Aguero then met four Brighton players.
He then hit one of the hinders and ran faster than the others and entered the public box for Brighton.
He then passed the ball to Sterling, who was on his left.
The Englishman hit the ball once and returned it to Aguero, who with his right foot hit the ball in the goal across Mathew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from foot pain", Machester City head coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he got a goal in that time".
But it was Sterling who led the team to a place in the Cup.
His yoke came in 29 minutes.
Aguero won the football in the Brighton team district.
He then gave Leroy Sane a good ball to the left of the court.
Sane hit the ball a few times and then passed Sterling by the ball.
Sterling just pushed the ball into the net before it slipped over the line.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the European Champions League qualifiers at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Sinheim stadium in Germany.
Scherzer wants a special game against the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no need to resume another game.
But the hard-hitting Scherzer wants to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, unless the outcome of the game is scheduled to have a share in the race, which the Rockies, in the NL West, are leading against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies got a chance after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first league title.
"While we won't win anything, we will enter the stadium knowing that the Denver crowd and our team will be the biggest game I can play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play such a game?"
The Nationals have not announced who will start Sunday, but they are likely to release Scherzer to play the game first.
Scherzer, who will be making 34 first-team appearances, made his preparations for the game Thursday and will play Sunday after a full break.
The Washngton yu has a 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and struck out 300 batters in 220 innings in two third-round games this season.
Trump's meetings in West Virginia
The president mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the need for a positive outcome for Republican Party supporters in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important decisions of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I don't run but I run too fast and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the right choice", he said.
Trump continued, "You see the horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore energy by any necessary means, you see, the hard, the bad.
He cares not for those who hurt him, who have to cross for power and correction, what they want with power and correction only, and we do not give them that".
The Democratic Party, he said, is "anti-prohibition".
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and cruel and mean and untruthful".
He also mentioned the name of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein as a Democrat, who was met with a derogatory response from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Have you released the document?
Ha, ha, why.
No, ha no, I'm waiting along - that was the worst body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a large church.
He does not allow anyone to express his feelings
When Momentum supporters in my party decided to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the Labour MPs to be told that we are not welcome - all because of our own expression.
My fellow lawmaker Joan Ryan was treated the same way for her opposition to religious extremism.
For me, the test subject has criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With the need for sound financial policy, national security, in Europe, issues Jeremy disagreed with past leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For my eight years as a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were the same.
Sadly today, not many conventions were held and the promise of political action in a "good, gentle" way has already been forgotten so that if this were the case, it has already happened.
It also seems that different opinions are not allowed in the Labor Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as my friends I thought were my political allies began to expect me to change and live in a position where I was not involved - whether it was in national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I spoke freely - and no matter what I said - following social media persecution they wanted me out of office, to criticize local politics, to tell me not to be a member of the Labor Party.
And I have more than just that.
Indeed, I know that I have more luck than some of my peers as the comments that have been made to me are political.
I admire the skill and dedication of those who face sexual abuse and discrimination every day without embarrassment.
One of the most frustrating aspects of our political era is how violent news is viewed as unusual.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should adopt a more socialist approach.
The truth is that we are no longer a larger congregation and with any "disbelief" or change in the rules the party diminishes.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years as they encourage me to lower my head, be less talkative, and be a better person".
But that was not the reason I got involved in politics.
Since joining the Labor Party 32 years ago as a student, frustrated by the failure of the Thatcher government to leave my entire class at the fall school, I have endeavored to promote good public service to those who need it most - whether it be a homeowner or a minister.
I never concealed my political motives, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed in any way by my policies and issues I disagree with this new leadership.
For all of them they promoted the idea on Friday, what I can say is that as the country enters a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government services, I do not understand my intention to waste time and energy loyal to the Labour leader.
But the message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the community I represent, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no electoral or political threat will prevent me from doing what I believe is important to all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undefeated team reaches the top
The final two goals changed the outcome, but Ayr was not surprised to win the exciting Tennessee League.
Ayr are the top, and the only undefeated team out of ten.
Finally, the defensive backs were successful, and the team's success was due to the lack of opportunities for the players.
"We've been up against tough teams but we've never lost, so I have to be happy", he said.
"Honor to Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did", says Robyn Christie of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's opportunity in 14 minutes was used by Ayr's manager Frazier Climo, but receiving a yellow card from Rory Hughes of Scotland, led the Melrose team to score through Jason Baggot.
Climo added to Ayr's goals by penalty shoot-out and scored a second goal before Ayr's lead was 17 to 5.
But Melrose's team got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's chances were used well by Baggot, who scored a few goals to cut the deficit to 5.
The match was then halted by an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the back, after Ayr scored more goals through a wounded Climo through a gap arranged by Stafford McDowall.
Ayr's assistant manager, Blair Macpherson, also received a yellow card and was released and Melrose took advantage of their surplus and tried to throw the yoke at Bruce Colvine, pressing Ayr's team.
The home team scored again, and after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored on the penote line for Ayr.
Climo was injured, as he was when the ball was restarted, when Kyle Rowe hit the ball in the box to give Gregor Henry the front-rowers a fifth chance for his team.
Still Game's talented artist is expected to launch a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game talent designer Ford Kieran is expected to launch a new career in the hospitality industry after it was announced that he was appointed as the CEO of a licensed food company.

The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season is the show's final, and it is likely that Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to the list of approved companies, he is the chairman of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in the Scottish Sun also said that Kiernan wanted to participate in "a lucrative food business in Glasgow".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia a remote country hopes to reopen the road to the Pacific
The Marines are in charge of the naval armament headquarters in La Paz.
Government buildings fly blue flags.
The naval camps from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a slogan: The sea is ours for freedom.
To make it our responsibility".
Throughout the remote Bolivia, the memory of the beach that Chile lost in the bloodiest war of the 20th century is still well-known - as is the longing to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is perhaps the greatest for decades now, as Bolivia awaits a decision by an international court on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a strong, united and peaceful spirit, and it has great hope and confidence in the outcome", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's governor.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's ruling at major demonstrations across the country, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's claim - after years of deliberations - that Chile should negotiate to give Bolivia a seafaring base.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's most prominent president - facing a tough run for re-election next year - also has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some experts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia - and minor changes may be made.
The United Nations from the Netherlands has no authority to assign territory to Chile, and it has said that it does not know the outcome of the negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final cases were heard shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean jurist.
Besides advancing Bolivia's goal, the past four years may have brought the country back.
"The issue of landing has been taken up by the Bolivian authorities here", said Zárate.
Morales' harsh words have ruined all the good that remained in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue to discuss, but it will be much more difficult to discuss after that.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the suggestion that the court decisions were surprisingly swift.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to establish new relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "solve 139 years of conflict and build a fruitful relationship", he said.
Calzadilla also criticized Morales - one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - for using maritime affairs as a political strategy.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to the Pacific", he added.
"This is an opportunity to undo the past".
North Korea says it will not destroy nuclear weapons unless it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says their country will not destroy its nuclear weapons for the first time if they do not trust Washington.
Ri makes this remarks on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill its promise at a meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume the failed three-month nuclear talks at the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "just a dream" that continued economic sanctions and US refusal to declare the Korean War over will cause the North to kneel down.
Washington does not want to announce that before Pyongyang begins to destroy weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are seeking a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang may be determined to abandon what the country sees as the only security option.
Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows unveil a number of new hats on the way to the High Street near you
If you want a variety of hats or a full sunscreen, look nowhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a number of large SS19 hats on the street that delighted and surprised those with some fashion at Paris Fashion Week.
Unthinkable hats were posted on Instagram last summer and the designers have brought their most beautiful creatures to the street.
Valentino's clear hat was a high-heeled, large, feathered hat that filled the heads of the exhibitors.
Some larger additions include a velvet design, a strange hat and a navel - but they didn't make your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled the color of the amazing facial masks - and during the Halloween celebration.
Many of the beautiful face masks were lipstick and more in line with Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembles a water bathtub filled with tubes and glasses, while another creature resembles a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you keep talking about this fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion managers predict that large bonnets can go to the main streets near you.
The large hats are prominently displayed alongside the 'La Bomba' shoes, a two-legged grass hat that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The religious icon behind the unthinkable hat that spread on social media sent another giant creature to the street market - a beach bag made of large grass almost like swimming gear.
The orange purple, palm-price and white leather bag was a highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope to see big hats and seabags hit the high street next summer - as the manufacturer has made a big impact it may be hard to ignore the need for big brands.'
John Edward: Speaking different languages is a must for all people on earth
Independent schools in Scotland have a very good academic record, and this has continued in 2018 with some positive test results, which are only encouraged by excellence in sports, arts, music and more.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible care for children and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career, and their status as global citizens.
As a field of education that can design and implement interactive school curricula, we see modern languages continue to be the most sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a father in his language, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, what is going through his heart?"
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build friendship and trust with foreigners.
From the recent results of this year's tests, we can see that languages are being studied by more people and that they are doing well in these subjects in independent schools.
About 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages did well and achieved Special A grade results.
The data, collected in 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Mandarin A grade point average, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language education as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, being practiced in the same way in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers reported a lack of language skills due to the difficulty of finding suitable people.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare young people for future careers.
Since many job opportunities open up to language skills, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of the career choice, if a person learns a second language, he or she will have the opportunity to develop such a long-term skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners puts a multilingual person first.
According to YouGov's community of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language enough to communicate effectively and only French is spoken by a figure of two-hundredths, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching programs is now essential for modern children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing countries, will help children to find better jobs.
In Scotland, each school has its own language.
Several schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem to be of great importance in the UK for the 2020 year, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in these fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to developing learning strategies on how to prepare children and equip them with the skills they may need to succeed, regardless of what happens in the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in the global business world, that languages continue to be of great importance in the future of this world, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "global communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to deliver this choice, increasing and improving the lives of Scottish children.
It must be well done.
John Edward and the Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans hoping to see LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact time limit was not known.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James may be able to play a few minutes.
Following a practice exercise earlier this week, James was asked what he planned to do about the Lakers' six-game schedule for the season".
"I don't need a seasonal game at this time to get ready", he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
It is one of five Trump meetings for tomorrow's week, including stand-alone meetings in Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the vote to approve his nomination to the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump wants to call a midterm election while his Republican party is in danger of losing power in the November parliamentary election.
When is the convention, and how can you view it online?
The Trump summit is at 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the program live on the Internet through the Internet site YouTube.
Trump is due to speak out on the cases of Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, which sparked outrage because it relates to Kavanaugh's alleged attempted rape after a confirmation vote has been suspended for a week now as the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the conventions is to help the Republican Party win a majority in the November elections.
Thus, the purpose of the five Trump meetings is "to encourage our supporters and well-meaning people as the Republican Party seeks to protect and increase the number of its members in the legislature", according to reports by Reuters.
"The presence of a large number of councillors is a key factor in the fact that the presidents have held these meetings in many places as we go to the time of the rallies", one of the campaign leaders for the election of Trump told Reuters.
The convention, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, will be open to attendance from Ohio and Pennsylvania and broadcast by Pittsburgh radio", according to the West Virginia Metro.
Saturday marks the second time in the last month that Trump has visited the west side of Virginia, a city he won with 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is also running for re-election.
"The support of the presidents in these elections is not a good image for Morrisey", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA has shown a manly victory in its games to keep their chances as Sunday's game draws near
After three games, a four-man Saturday game could be a game if it deserved the Ryder Cup.
Evolution is a complex game, but it is a matter of belief, especially in competitions like this.
To whom, then, is this a privilege?
"They led by six points but now by four, so we take this as an opportunity", Jordan Spieth said as he walked slowly.
The European team has a chance, leading by 4 points with 12 games remaining.
The American team, Spieth says, feels that they have a lot to offer, such as the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been successful and has set a fine example.
As he and Thomas continued to shout, the ball dropped into the hole, giving the teams a four-point lead.
His pitching beat the game on the 15th hole and the crowd grew the same, a sign of his conviction that the American team never won.
"You just have to wear a suit and think about your game", Spieth said.
That's what all these players have here.
Only 18 holes later the team has shown a man.
The players with the most points to beat Spieth and Thomas in these two days are Frascesco Milinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are the current holders of the Ryder Cup.
The two European players have won four out of four and are perfect.
"Moliwood" was the only two-man team not to play near the pitch on Saturday afternoon, as well as Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine holes in the final.
This, along with their strength and speed, is a sign that they are a team that will be hard to beat on Sunday, and no European team will beat Fleetwood or Molinari more than the sun sets at Le Golf National.
They may be in different caves.
It is still easy to say that the European team has won the cup, so far.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, who was a team mate with Alex Noren in a four-ball game this morning.
The close pitch and the two first nine pitches led their team to the point where the Spanish and Swedish champions refused to return.
But God has no one to diminish his success.
A four-ball game with four players is a thrilling sight to behold because of the interaction of two players in each team, the instructions given, the instructions not given, and the changes in the gameplay.
So far the European team has played well as a team and is heading into the final with a strong lead, but the four-man game showed that the American team has the potential to win, which is especially doubtful for the Stateside.
European team leads by 10-6 points on the final day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will have a great opportunity to play the final game in the Ryder Cup after defeating the American team in four football matches on Saturday by 10-6 points.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who led the team against Tiger Woods in a tough match, their success at the Le Golf National Stadium led to their four points.
The European team, coached by Thomas Bjorn, seeking to recover the trophy they had refused to defend two years earlier at Hazeltine Stadium, pressed the American team into their morning four-ball game, on a 3-1 schedule.
The American team held on to the four-ball game by winning two games, but it did not hold back the victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday games to win the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row in the competition and through their best performance on Saturday, he and Molinari, who are simply dubbed "Molliwood" by fans, are the second two players to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After a brutal victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, the first American to win the championship, were defeated by a best score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who tried to pull himself out in two Saturday games, occasionally showed a strong showing but has so far lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-man matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, retired from the morning four-ball game, then formed a two-man team with Henrik Stenson in a four-man game and won by 2 points to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the top three in the world.
On a cold day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not pass through the clear.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the American team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 points over Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter of the Spanish team in the four-ball competition and beat Poulter and rory Mcllroy 4 and 3 in the four-ball competition despite losing their first two games.
The Ryder Cup is the only time in history that a team with four points remaining in a single game has won, although the Furyk team defending the cup only needs to match the other team to win the cup.
After two days of second place, Sunday's top game looks to be a tough one.
North Korea says it has "no reason" to stop its weapons without reliance
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continued non-proliferation increased their distrust of the American government and that there was no reason for its country to abandon its nuclear weapons at that time.
Ri Yong Ho spoke at the annual convention of the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "a decisive step" in the past year, including stopping its nuclear and bomb tests, breaking down its nuclear reactor and vowing not to add nuclear weapons.
"But we have never seen America do the same thing again", he said.
"Without trust in America, we will not be satisfied with our national security and in these matters we will not be able to begin to abandon nuclear weapons ourselves".
While Ri repeats North Korea's complaint about the "slow" withdrawal from nuclear weapons to the United States, which deserves praise for North Korea's major achievements, his words were effective because his country has not been as aggressive as Pyongyang has been in the past.
Ri referred to a message co-written by Kim Jong Un and Trump at the first U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try "to stop the use of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" and Trump stressed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long wanted an end to the war between North and South Korea, but the United States has insisted that North Korea stop using nuclear weapons.
The United States has refused to reduce the severity of North Korea's sanctions.
"The United States is insisting on "the first steps to stop nuclear weapons", has been increasing the scale of North Korea's efforts to pressure North Korea, and the United States has refused to "declare an end to the war", said Ri.
"The idea that punishment can be imposed is a fantasy of those we do not know well.
The problem is that this separation increases our intolerance".
Ri did not mention the second Kim-Trump meeting that the US president announced at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke of Kim's meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae over the past five months and added: "If the disarmament issue had been between us and South Korea rather than America, the disarmament issue on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a level of disagreement".
Still, Ri's remarks were different from last year's at a U.N. summit when he told them that targeting American territories with North Korean weapons was easy when "Wicked President" Trump called Kim "an expert" at a futile summit.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for being the first man to stop using nuclear weapons, but said that much work needed to be done and that North Korea's sanctions should be continued until North Korea stops using them.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time limit, saying "either two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have asked the UN Security Council to pay tribute to North Korea for its efforts.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.S. National Security Committee: "The sanctions imposed on North Korea by the U.S. National Security Committee should continue and continue until the country has fully eliminated its weapons".
The Committee has been expanding North Korea's simplification since 2006 to prevent North Korea's investments in nuclear and other nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would travel to North Korea next month to arrange a second meeting between Trump and Kim.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
They left North Korea saying that the talks had been successful, but hours later North Korea opposed him by saying that he was offering "subversive points".
North Korea promised to meet with Moon this month to destroy the nuclear plant and the nuclear warehouse if the United States did "the same thing".
They said Kim told them that "the same things" he wanted were Trump's promise of security in Singapore and a new way to repair relations with the United States.
Harvard University students are learning a lesson about promoting adequate sleep
The new Harvard University study, which began this year, has led to the goal of getting enough sleep for graduates to eliminate the habit of reading all night with 'sleep-suppressants.'
One scholar observed that students at these world-class universities lack basic skills to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, produced what he believes is the first study in American history.
He recommended starting the study after the lecture on the consequences of sleep deprivation.
'After graduation one girl approached me and said: 'Why am I being told this in my final year?'
He said no one told him the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The study, which began this year, explains to students the importance of getting proper sleep in school and sports, as well as the health benefits.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Institute of Health Sciences, said the university decided to launch the study after finding that most students do not sleep well during the week.
This one-hour study includes a variety of interviews.
In one section is a picture of a hostel room, where students tap on a cup of coffee, curtains, teachers, and books to be told the dangers of sleep-disrupting drugs and how theater performance is impaired by insomnia, and the importance of getting to bed at the right time.
In another study, students are told that sleep deprivation often puts people at risk for heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The school map with the articles provides a message that encourages the students to reflect on their daily activities.
'We know that they do not change the behavior of teachers' immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the harm of smoking,' said Professor Czeisler.
The prideful attitude of 'studying all night,' he said, adding that new skills and the students' stress and education add to the students' insomnia.
Ensuring adequate sleep, he said, and a healthy way of sleeping, should be the students' 'secret tool' for dealing with depression, fatigue, and anxiety - and they should avoid being overweight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to lack vital resources and thus often starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old medical student from California, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study by learning one of the lessons he had learned during his first year at Harvard University.
He said that the study opened his eyes and encouraged him to encourage the professor to reach out to everyone at the university.
Next, he wants all graduate students to pursue similar studies before entering the university.
Professor Czeisler asked the students to set aside time for their watch to sound to remind them of the time to sleep and wake up, and to consider the dangers of cell phones, laptops, and electric lights that cause sleep deprivation.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga goal gave Gerrard the lead
The Rangers won again on the road - while Dolly Menga's goal led Gerrard, who seemed to be unfair, to a 1-0 lead over Livingston's team.
Ibrox's team is likely to win their first league title since February when they won 4-1 against St Johnstone, but a victory over Gerrard's team by Gary Holt has led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games since the start of the season, leaving the team eight points behind the top-flight team in the Hearts league.
Menga was injured seven minutes into the first half and the missing Rangers were not seen to return.
While the Rangers have dropped to sixth in the league standings, Livingston has moved up to third place and is just behind Hibernian by just six goals.
And there may be other challenges for the Rangers when assistant drummer Calum Spence was treated by doctors for a head injury after being hit by a supposedly thrown object from the side of the end.
Gerrard converted the eight players who defeated Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
While Holt did not change players who played a match of strength with the Hearts team last week and he must have been happy with how his team played the Rangers.
The Rangers were the best kept ball, but Livingston were the best kept ball.
And he had to kick in the first two minutes when Menga gave Scott Pittman a good ball to kick in the goal with Allan McGregor but the midfielder hit his ball on the side.
A ball from the film played by Keaghan Jacobs caught Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow but the back-up player along with Craig Halkett fought on the sidelines.
The Rangers were a man's team, but they seemed hopelessly discouraged, especially when they reached the top.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been given at least 15 minutes when he fought Steven Lawless, but the players turned down the Colombian player.
The Rangers only managed to score twice on goal but the former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not affected by the balls from Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
While the score of the 34th minute was against the pace of the game, no one can deny that the team had to score.
The Rangers also refused to remove the ball from Jacobs' film.
Scott Arfield did not close the ball when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson who played calmly and passed it to Menga who was easily injured.
Gerrard expressed his dissatisfaction with the Rangers when he fired Coulibaly and signed Ryan Kent and the change was quickly fruitful when the players handed the ball to Morelos but the top player Kelly rushed to remove the ball.
Livingston's team, however, forced the Rangers to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett only taking away long balls.
Holt's team could have scored more goals in the end, but McGregor successfully defended Jacobs, before Lithgow hit the ball side by side with his head.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton, who came from outside, cried no more after Jacobs's defeat, but Thomson, the players, refused the invitation.
Almanac: Manufacturer of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago to the present, is RECURSING ... the date on which the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure the energy released by atomic processing, a process that eventually led to the creation of a device called the Geiger Counter.
As a major scientific tool since then, the Geiger Counter has become a well-known tool, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear to be unreliable scientists:
Brother: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger Counter, used to extract electrical salts, such as uranium.
If you put these headphones on your head, you can feel the effects of the energy released by the atoms".
Evans: "This is truly amazing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But its products have survived.
A new cancer vaccine may help the immune system 'recognize' the dangerous cells
This new cancer vaccine may help the immune system 'recognize' and kill dangerous cells
Vaccines have helped the immune system to identify the dangerous cells as a way to treat the disease.
This involves removing body cells from the patient, then transforming them into a lab
Then they can "see" the proteins found in many cancers and then give him a shot
The vaccine is a trial that offers hope for people with various cancers.
A woman who receives the vaccine, who trains the immune system to detect dangerous cells, saw her cervical cancer go away for more than 18 months.
This involves removing the cells from the patient, transforming them in a lab to "see" a common cancer protein called HER2, and then restoring the cells to the body.
"Our results show that we have a vaccine to help us", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "combines several types of cancer, "including breast, uterine, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of removing body cells from patients and "teaching" them how to manage cancers will also work in treating a type of blood cancer.
After appearing on SNL, Kanye West launched a Trump-friendly campaign, wearing a hat written Make America Stronger Again.
It Did Not End Well
Kanye West was humiliated in the studio on Saturday Night Live after performing a performance in which he praised the US President. and said Donald Trump would win the 2020 election.
After singing her third song Ghost Town that night, in which she wore a hat written Make America Strong Again, she spoke out harshly to the Democratic Party and repeatedly said she supported Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and he says, 'How can you love Trump, you racist?'
So if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago", she said.
SNL originally introduced the show with Matt Damon as the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of rape.
Although not publicized, West's comments were posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with what he posted online.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he suffered greatly from his hat behind the stage.
"I was found behind the stage.
They said, 'not in there with that hat.'
I was found!
Then they say I'm in a vanishing position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
"Do you want to see the disappearing landscape?" West continued, adding, "he will wear my hero's hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His comments were criticized twice by the audience and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety noted, with one person there saying: "The whole studio was just silent".
West was replaced by singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend, singer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when she sang her song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was assisted by the head of the TPUSA self-help group, Candace Turner who wrote on Tweeter: "To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR STANDING IN THE GROUP".
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted a statement on Twitter that West was "just being who he is and it's very exciting".
"But I have not chosen to give any award (by buying music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe accepts and brings dangerous emotions into our community.
They have freedom.
We too", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that she had changed her name, stating that for the time being "I'm Kanye West".
They were not the first musicians to change their names and follow the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow singer, Snoop Dogg was once dubbed Snoop Lion and the legendary singer who died Prince, changed his name to the icon and then the singer who was previously known as Prince.
Murdered in a Belfast restaurant shooting
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after shooting his father in a west-side restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
His cases are heard by the Judicial Committee.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is angry with the fearful feelings about a man
Kit Harington is known for hitting with a knife as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress, who opposed the idea of being a hero, said that such roles on social media meant that young boys often felt they needed to be mature enough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something is wrong' and asked about ways to deal with the fearful attitudes about men in this #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a co-star in Game of Thrones, admits that he feels that it is "necessary" to address the problem.
'On my own, I wonder at this point - where did we waste it to make it?' he said.
'What are we teaching men as they grow older, especially in the challenge we are facing here?'
Kit believes that the radio can be one factor in the development of this trait but thanks to some of her male characters having good behavior.
He continued: 'What is man born with and what is he taught?
What is taught on television and in the public schools that makes boys see that they must be this way to become men?
I find this to be one of the most important questions now - how can we change this?
Because something is obviously wrong with boys.'
During the visit, he also agreed that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones series until the morning show, saying, 'I have finished the war and the horse riding.'
Since November Kit has been involved in the revival of the Sam Shepard-directed True West drama about a filmmaker and his brother who is a burglar.
The actor said that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing he had ever seen in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the set of the play, so I found my family forever and my whole life from now on,' he says.
Rose was Ygritte, who was in love with Jon Snow's real name Kit, in the drama that also won a medal at the Emmy Awards.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 in the backyard of Leslie's parents' farm in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 percent in the number of new cases
The country has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials say.
The current 40,000 participants were in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of these people were infected through sexual intercourse, which led to a change in the course of their lives.
Initially, the HIV virus is spread widely through blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV through this method has been reduced, the health ministry of China told a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV has increased dramatically in homosexual relationships.
The laws against same-sex relationships in China were repealed in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has increased in the country.
Because of the anti-gay culture in the world, studies have shown that about 70 to 90 percent of gay men eventually marry women.
The prevalence of the virus in these relationships is due to unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide HIV-related assistance to all in an effort to combat the virus.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee was the one who reported the Republican congressman, calling it a "false lie" and "a lie"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied reports that her office staff had leaked confidential information from three Republican lawmakers to the lawmakers' website.
Waters, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said that the article was published by "people and websites" that are obsessed with corrupting the public's reputation.
"This is a lie, a terrible lie", Waters said in a tweet on the game's Twitter page.
The message contained the addresses and telephone numbers of the American counselors Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The message was posted online on Capitol Hill on Thursday after an unknown person posted it during a suspected case that Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated justice of the Supreme Court, tried to rape women.
The message was released after the three counselors questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative party websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState also reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the site was linked to the Waters office" and provided information about the Waters employee, Hill said.
"This nonsense is a complete lie", Waters said.
"The employees of this office - whose name has been given and whose confidentiality and security have been compromised for the alleged falsehood - are not the ones who have issued the message.
This is a complete lie".
Waters' comments will be criticized by several people on the Internet, including former White House secretary general Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is anger", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that he is not fit to be a Member of Parliament.
If someone is being lied to, he should not be angry.
They should not be disrespectful of authority.
They should not hate the motives of those who accuse them.
They need to be calm and calm".
Fleischer appears to be discussing Waters' speeches and the criticism of the judges, Kavanaugh and the Democrats, who were accused of answering questions in a furious Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"The biggest story, if it's true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his speech, Waters said his office "informed the appropriate authorities and the police of the matter.
"We will make sure that the people who publish this information are known", he continued, "and they will be held accountable for their actions in accordance with the law because they are dangerous and disturbing to all my employees".
The cover of Johnny English Strikes Again - Atkinson's uninspiring spy comedy
It is now clear that the benefits of Britain's Withdrawal from European Union are being swept away by every British magazine and this is happening in the context of another Jonny English film - first in 2003 with the Jonny English film and then again in 2011 with the re-release of Jonny English Reborn.
Would a rash and derogatory talk about this point point to the harm of making the world a business?
On any level, Johnny English with his large eyes and unconscious appearance had the ability to recreate things again  to show that he had the ability to make a comedy film that spoke English without reaching a wider audience.
He is a major figure, who even in his humorous routine is a police officer, and Bean is a British superhero who is the message of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The story is based on Atkinson's trip to the old Barclay radio commercial, which caused a stir.
There's a month or two of fun in this new Johnny English movie.
I was fascinated by Johnny English as he followed the plane with his old-fashioned safety gear and knives hanging from his hat.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but his humor is somewhat shallow and "wonderfully" woven, especially considering the great humor of 007 and Mission Impossible.
His humor seems to be for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's visits are less skillful and more consistent than Atkinson's silent and Bean-like films.
The first of these is Britain's serious crisis.
Some hackers infiltrated British spyware, leaking information from all British officials in various locations, disrupting a local official - a small part of Kevin Eldon's campaign.
It's the final act of a fearful and distressed prime minister, who is facing the consequences of her political neutrality: Emma Thompson is burning at the stake for her divorce as Teresa May but nothing more is added to the drama.
His wise advisors tell him that since every spy is distracted, he should fire someone else.
And this is what Johnny English, a former headmaster at a high school, is saying about the secret work of a secret police officer: the pope has good things, while English teaches various children about espionage.
English is taken to a meeting in Whitehall for an emergency message and meets a longtime colleague, Bough, who is also taken by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a naval officer, a part of a coward who Vicki Pepperdine misused.
So Batman and Robin the heroes of the great King have also misused, who meet Olga Kurylenko's daughter, the influencer Ophelia Bulletova.
Now the prime minister is confused by the actions of a wealthy man who claims to solve the problems of Britain's computer system: Jason Volta, who is replaced by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough have begun their work: pretending to be catering providers at a public restaurant, they set fire to a French restaurant; this caused a stir until they boarded the upper Volta train; and English caused a stir when they tried to use a tape recorder to see what was inside the Volta house.
All the final events take place in the final episode, but the excitement and thrill of it, makes it a children's video in every way.
It's a little bit of a thrill.
As with other Johnny English films, I failed to think: could British filmmakers not give Rowan Atinkson a role in excavating his talent?
Labour rejects a plan to give British citizens four days a week to work but only five days a week
Jeremy Corbyn's party has a big idea that sees British citizens working four days a week - but being paid five days.
The group says it wants employers to share the profits of artificial intelligence (AI) with their employees by giving them a day off.
The plan would allow workers three days of rest - yet they receive the same pay.
According to the release, this view may be "in line" with the party's economic ideology and the ideology of changing the world for the benefit of workers.
The four-day workweek adjustment was approved by the Employment Representatives as a way for workers to benefit from technological advances.
A Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It may not be a one-day plan but a four-day workweek plan is well suited to party policies so that workers can benefit from economic advances and new business processes.'
The Labor Party is not the first to confirm such a proposal, while the Green Party pledged four working days a week during the 2017 election.
However, this is not the view of all members of the Labor Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not a party idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took the opportunity of a Labor Party meeting last week to present his ideas on changing how people can benefit from the national economy.
McDonnell says he is determined to recover power from "hopeless executives" and "profitable" philanthropists.
The leader's plans also mean that shareholders in the water industry cannot get their full income back as the Labor government may make some of the money 'withdrawn' for reasons they consider wrong.
He also confirmed the introduction of a plan to enlist 10 percent of the workforce, resulting in an annual income of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy has told "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the alleged case of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by about a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings from the investigation should change any Republican senators to dissuade him.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, television journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"To be honest, that's it", said Kennedy.
"Going to hear the case, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and he said, 'Have you done this?'
He was courageous, determined, and unshakable".
Graham's vote, however, is clearly not going to be voted down.
"My view of Brett Kavanaugh is unchanged and I should change it only in the case of a serious case", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who mentions him can prove it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything that could change right now".
What is the International Festival of Musicians, and what has it done to alleviate poverty?
The annual New York City Music Festival, held on Saturday, brings together musicians from all over the world to sing a song about ending poverty.
This year's festival, which will be held for seven consecutive years, will draw thousands of people to the Central Park Zoo not only to celebrate such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to spread the word about the festival's ultimate goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The International Music Festival, which began in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project's global campaign to combat global poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against poverty.
To receive a ticket to the party (unless you want to buy a ticket for the celebration), the participants must perform various activities or activities such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the president, cheering, or any other intelligent means that could help spread the cause of poverty alleviation.
But how much has the Festival accomplished in the 12 years that have elapsed since its purpose was accomplished?
Is free music a good way to get people to act or is it just another way to fight online - to sign a document online or to send a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Festival Directors have reportedly obtained 19 million items from their followers to fight their various goals.
They say these developments have helped to encourage national leaders to agree and develop plans for $37 billion in investment to support 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 projects from its events, of which $10 billion has been donated or already raised.
The organization's contributions have changed the lives of 649 million people on earth.
Among other initiatives is the UK-based health promotion campaign "Childhood Development", which pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million in funding to combat childhood obesity, after receiving 4,700 tweets.
"With the help of the UK government, the goodwill community, national governments, and people like you, we can end obesity one of the most prominent health advocates, Tracey Ullman told a London music festival in April 2018.
The group also said through more than 5000 speeches the group was encouraged to encourage the UK government to improve the health of mothers and children, and the government announced a financial contribution to the programme which will benefit up to 5 million mothers and children.
In response to a question they received on their Internet system, "What do you think we can do about poverty?"
The group responded: "It will be a difficult and time-consuming battle - and we will sometimes lose and fail.
But like the liberation movements of the day, we can achieve our goals because unity is a force.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will entertain the crowd at a New York City party, conducted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America could use military forces to "stop" Russia from exporting power - Minister of Foreign Affairs
The United States will use its Navy "if appropriate" to prevent the export of precious stones and energy from Russia to various countries, including Asian countries, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to reports by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's operations in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the country's official government - are a fake way to get a market for precious stones and energy.
"I believe that Russia has sent its people to Asia to access its energy market as the country is doing in the Eastern European countries", he said.
And, he added, there are ways to deal with this.
"America has such a potential, with our Navy, to open the gates and, if necessary, to block their power from reaching the market", he said.
Zinke said this in a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself America's "mouth of energy consumers".
He said that Washington's confrontation with Russia is similar to that with Iran, saying that it will have the same objective.
"Russia's economic system with Iran is the same, developing and transforming oil", he said while comparing Russia to a "purposeful profit" on oil.
This comes as the Trump administration is on the cusp of boosting its European oil market, replacing Russia's low-cost oil market.
In this regard, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump, is trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 deal with Russia, Trump said that the deal made Germany a "slave" of Russia".
Russia has argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to increase its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters by length and width, is economic policy alone.
Russia has repeatedly accused the United States of being hostile to the system for economic reasons and of being a model of trade oppression.
"I believe we agree that energy markets should not be a threat to others and that energy users should have the opportunity to choose who sells them", said Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. actions were not pleasing to Germany, and Germany has insisted on continuing its cooperation with the regime.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's largest trade association, has urged the United States to stay out of the European energy and energy cooperation with Germany and Russia.
"I am very disappointed when another country interferes in our energy purchases", said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI after a meeting between German leader Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Together" Consider Participating in the 2020 Presidential Election, Massachusetts Representative Said
Massachusetts representative Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "deeply" consider participating in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At a convention in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider participating.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included a high-ranking woman", according to The Hill.
"After November 6, they want to 'think deeply' the issue of going to the presidential election".
Warren responded to President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that he was "taking the region in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was at the forefront of the criticism of Trump and nominated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "we really need an FBI investigation before we vote".
The township released Thursday, indicated that most of the Warren area don't think it's appropriate to run for election in 2020.
Ninety-eight percent of those "who can" vote in Massachusetts say the senator should not participate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent agreed with the participation proposal.
The survey shows that the majority of people agree that former governor Deval Patrick should be involved, with 38 percent supporting the possibility and 48 percent opposing it.
Some of the most prominent Democratic candidates who are being discussed for the 2020 presidential nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a good decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin discusses the PTSD related to Track Palin at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted on Sept.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"My son's experience, his experience on the way back, I can understand some of the families affected by PTSD and some of the experiences our military is going through", he told a crowd at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said her arrest was "a big issue that no one wants to mention" and regarding her son and other fighters, "they come back a little changed, come back strong, come back wondering if there is any respect for what fellow soldiers and workers, and any other member of the military, have contributed to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, disrupting the reporting of a domestic violence case and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, Spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. oppose new refugee protection laws
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are opposed to a new U.S. law that prohibits aid to refugees fleeing domestic violence and terrorism.
Lawyers from 18 counties and districts on Friday filed a lawsuit in Washington state court to support a refugee seeking asylum who is also opposed to the law, according to a report by NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the government's policies was not disclosed.
She also claimed that her husband, "and a gang of violent children", were abusing her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Grace's assistant attorneys described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which bring the largest number of asylum seekers to the U.S., as countries facing increased hardship from gang violence and domestic violence.
A new US law on the protection of refugees from domestic violence amended the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allows undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek protection.
Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said Friday in his statement that the law "ignores decades-old federal, state, and national law".
"The law requires that all refugee claims for threats be judged on facts and circumstances, and such a ban is in violation of the law", the lawyers said.
The lawyers also summarized that the ban on immigration could have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, saying that the immigrants could be businessmen and "essential workers".
In June, Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide safe haven for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Protection is provided to those who have fled their homes because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular group or political opinion", the Court said in issuing the order on June 11.
Providing protection did not mean solving all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
Emergency rescue operations in Palu are underway to find survivors as the death toll doubles
For survivors, things are getting worse.
"It's getting more difficult", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her malaria-ridden son at a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
People are seen returning to their destroyed homes, carrying their belongings in floodwaters, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to cope with the demands.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to some strong earthquakes that were ongoing.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he had with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
He pressed me into the ruins of the wall, thinking to myself, "Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding ceremony.
I heard my wife crying for help, and it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope she is fine".
The United States has accused China of "disturbing" "commercial communications"
A week after a reputable Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial report in the U.S. newspaper that denounced the U.S.-China trade agreement, the U.S. ambassador to China said that China was using the American newspaper to spread false news.
U.S. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a special section of the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest newspaper, which was edited by a Chinese newspaper - following the president's accusation that China is trying to disrupt the November 6 U.S. Senate election, a case China denies.
According to Reuters, the US government's allegations against Trump's election campaign have been a sign of a new US campaign against China.
While it is legal for some foreign countries to publish commercial communications in newspapers, China and the United States are having a trade dispute, a dispute that has led to high tariffs on imports.
China's import tax was aimed at countering the Iowa businessmen who were Trump's Republican allies, said Chinese-American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the mayor of Iowa, which exports agricultural imports to China, said China's actions had hurt American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
Writing in the Des Moines Register, Branstad said: "China is making a big deal of the messaging by putting fake commercial messages on our own papers".
"By spreading its lies, the Chinese government is using the freedom of speech and press freedom that America is proud of by paying for the advertising of the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the street newspaper market here in Beijing, you will find little criticism and you will not see any light on the Chinese people's economic crisis in China, since the press is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
Not to mention his newspaper, they added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided publishing" his story.
Republican Party Votes Women in the Swamp About Kavanaugh, Investigators Warn
While many Republican leaders are in favor of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a judge of the Supreme Court even though Kavanaugh is suspected of attempting to rape women, experts say this will cause problems, especially from women in the upcoming elections.
The issue has sparked outrage, and the Republican Party has publicly declared that it is ready for a referendum to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
These things cannot be returned", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's undergraduate school at Syracuse University, said in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that encouraging FBI investigations that Arizona state councillor Jeff Flake is taking time off would ease the anger of voters.
"Mothers will never forget yesterday - not tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, head coach of the women's movement MoveOn, according to reports in the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted November is coming! as they protested in the lobby of the legislature when the Republican-led committee decided to proceed with Mr. Kavanaugh's election despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic newspaper reported.
"Interest in democracy will be low", said political scientist Stu Rothenberg to the newspaper.
"People say that interest has been high; it is true.
But it could be particularly prevalent among urban women and young people aged 18 to 29 who are also eligible to vote, who may not like the president, but do not vote".
Although Ford's evidence of Kavanaugh's attempted rape had not been released, experts said that if the Republican Party could confirm Kavanaugh's election, the public would be outraged.
"This has shown the defects of the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week according to NBC newspaper reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or final vote or Kavanaugh's approval as a Supreme Court justice, but the way the Republican Party has handled the matter and how it has handled the woman", Guy Cecil, the director of the Center for American Progress, told the paper.
On the other hand, Americans seem to have different opinions on the matter, especially on the basis of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and many are on Kavanaugh's side.
The new YoGov township showed that 41 percent of the township's participants believed Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said Ford lied in his testimony.
Following Flake's allegations, the FBI is investigating the case reported by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Mr. Ford testified before the House Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, had tried to rape her at age 17.
Ramirez said Kavanaugh showed off his nudity at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980's.
The World Wide Web's creators are planning to launch a new website to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a website to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new project of the expert, called Inrupt, is a company that wants to continue whereas the Berner-Lee re-developed Solid program has ceased.
The Solid Web site allows users to choose their own storage and to choose the content they want to see.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal of Inrupt is "to win over everyone".
"We must do it now", he said of the site.
"It is a very good news".
The software will use the solid-state software to allow users to create their own "online storage" or POD.
The app can store, direct, calendar, music, and other personal and professional items.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all put together at the same time.
A unique feature of this online privacy service is that users have the right to choose who they want to view the information they want to view.
The company describes the launch as "a message of encouragement".
John Bruce, CEO of the company, said that our focus at Inrupt is on delivering the right products, processes and technologies that will make Solid available to everyone.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, security consultants from IBM, computer engineers hired to help with the software, and volunteers with a variety of skills.
As of this week, computer engineers around the world have been able to modify their own software using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his associates do not consult with the owners of "Facebook and Google about whether or not they will make a complete change that will result in their entire operations being temporarily placed there.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium's website posted on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the goal of Inrupt is to provide business power and environmental impact to protect the technology and quality of the new software from this Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he launched his own website, the World Wide Web, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been speaking on a debate about the need for uniformity among all Internet developers.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the owner and CEO of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new program", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A pastor who received the Victoria Cross after fighting in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England minister who received the Victoria Cross during the Civil War as a civil servant has been celebrated in his hometown even a century later.
The comet was discovered by the Rev. Lt. Col. Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, during the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt conspiracies.
Four days later, however, he was killed by an undercover officer, unaware that he had gained the rank of major in the British army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was displayed by her two grandchildren on a plaque in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was a "superb thing" to have the stone displayed a century after their grandfather discovered the note.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his troops across the Saint-Quentin River "in fog and heavy fire from a machine gun and machine gun".
Then he hurried ahead and "brilliantly" and privately led his army to seize a rifle and kill the three-man army.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German secret service officer on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandmother's actions were "a lesson in humility that I know I cannot but can do".
He and his brother Dr James Vann planted a cork after the pellet, which is led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he feels "honored to have been a part of the panel" and added that "the courage of the bridesmaids is evident in many celebrations".
MMA fans didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine, you didn't sleep through the night to watch the giant Bellator 206 play and then finally get unseen.
The schedule from San Jose consisted of 13 episodes, including six on the main card and was shown overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the UK were shocked when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were not happy because they stayed up late, especially because they expected the battle to take place.
One follower has commented on Twitter about the program's transformation into a children's cartoon as "just a joke".
"It is a government policy that at 6 a.m. this was not appropriate to show so it had to be changed to a children's program, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's deputy director of marketing and communications, when asked about the matter.
""Peppa pigs", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would carefully review the arrangements for their programmes to include UK viewers in the future.
We're thinking about repeating the program, and I think we might be able to do that", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we can't do this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working hard to make things work.
To be honest, the moment that changed was a lot of writing going back and forth and not all was good.
We worked hard to fix it, thinking that it might be a machine problem.
But it was not. It was a matter of public policy.
I promise you that this will never happen again.
We would plan five fights instead of six - as we do - and we tried to feed our fans more and more and we just missed the target in doing so.
It is very difficult".
Desert Island talk show: Tom Daley 'hide' himself from the group he loves
The Olympic swimmer grew up hiding from the crowd he loved, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old scholar admits that he did not realize until he was in high school that "no one is like me".
Speaking on the first four interviews on Desert Island broadcast by Lauren Laverne, she said that she discusses gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent helps him to avoid focusing on success in his games.
The program's host, Kirsty Young, has been absent for months due to illness.
Speaking on the first program of Laverne, Daley said that her growing up feeling "out of place" was "not acceptable for boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "the feeling of being left behind and of being different have been the things that have encouraged and empowered me to succeed in my sports".
He wanted to show people that he was "one of his own", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he learned of the group of people he loved.
The two-time bronze medalist has become a well-known gay rights activist and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on many countries to legalize same-sex marriage.
She said she talks because she feels she was lucky to have remained free even though she has revealed that she loves her mate and wants to give "encouragement" to others.
The three-time World Cup winner said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "was a shock to me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning actress, who is 20 years her senior, a year ago, but she said the difference was nothing.
"You're going through a lot at this age"  she participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later- she said it was hard to find someone who had met the challenges she had.
In June they became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "their outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have thought about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know, there's more to life than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted his death and that one of the things he asked before he died was whether his tickets to the 2012 London Games had been available - that he wanted to be ahead.
"I never told them you wouldn't be in the future because you'd be dead", he said.
"I held their hands as they died, and it was only when they died that I realized that they were not eternal", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was my dream - to dive in front of people at the Olympics, and there was nothing better than that", he says.
This also inspired her first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which inspired her to prepare for the Olympics and continues to make her feel good.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, whose playing record dropped, was left out of the Ryder Cup game on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States has been making records on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to play more than he has in the middle of the season to avoid a disappointing record.
Mickelson, who is playing 12th in the cup in two years, was sidelined and replaced by the player-manager, Jim Furyk, in a four-man match.
Instead of being one of the players of the day, the five-time American champion is simply sitting around shouting and preparing to improve his game.
The 48-year-old, who was not the most dangerous player during his prime, is not a good player for the difficult Le Golf National Cup, as hitting a ball at a distance can be a painful blow.
And if the race is not too dangerous, Mickelson will meet British champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game this Sunday, who played alongside Tommy Fleetwood, the only other champion to win four games this week.
If the American players, who are four points behind in their first 12 games, can play well, Mickelson's game may be more valuable.
Furyk said that he trusted the expert, but he did not say much.
"He understood what he had to do today, complimented me and hugged me and told me that he would be ready for tomorrow's drama", Furyk said.
"He is self-confident.
He is a professional who has made a lot of progress and has played for the team in the past, and this week.
I don't expect him to play two games.
I expected more games, but that's just the way it was and that's the way we felt we should have done it.
He wants to play like everyone else".
In Sunday's games Mickleson outperformed Nick Faldo in terms of most Ryder Cup games.
This will bring his game to a conclusion that is unparalleled in his individual playing.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and tied 7 times, but Furyk says his presence strengthens his team.
"He's funny, mocking, funny, and sociable, and he's a good guy to hang out with", she explained.
"I think the young players were happy to play with him, this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just playing".
European team manager Thomas Bjorn knows that their lead may be lost
Thomas Bjorn knows from past experience that their lead in the individual Ryder Cup can easily change to a difficult one to defend.
The Danish player made his debut at Valderrama in 1999, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the American team but managed to win by just 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember ourselves having a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but with few points", Bjorn said, after watching a good team in 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead in the Le Golf National competition.
So history teaches me and everyone in the team that the game is not over.
We must persevere in the work.
Let's go to the theater and do well.
The game was not over until we had the most points.
Our goal is to try to win the cup, and this is where we should focus.
I've always said that I'm interested in the 12 players on our team, and we know the players we're playing with - the best players in the world".
Delighted with the way his players played in the tournament on a challenging golf course, Bjorn said: "I can't feel alone.
Tomorrow's game is another.
Tomorrow, each person's abilities will be revealed, and this is a difficult task to do.
It is good to play with a partner when things are going well, but to play alone, when golfers are fully tested.
The message to the players is to be a man himself at the game tomorrow.
Here, you leave your partner and he has to do it alone".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will want his players to be stronger than they were in the two-man game, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of their four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the transition, when he was on the winning team at Brookline before being on the losing team when the European team "did a miracle" at Medinah".
"I remember everything", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 head coach, encouraged his players on the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games but we have to stop early as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
If this happens in one, the midfielder is under pressure.
We have organized our games and have ranked the players as if we wanted to do something amazing tomorrow".
Thomas has been given the task of starting a slowdown in the group and will play Rory Mcllroy in the big leagues, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play the European team on a European roster.
"I put these players in this position because I believe they will help us to the end", he said of his selection of players for solo games.
The German naval fleet was also redesigned
The new German warship was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the old one used in the Great Patriotic War, but it will not be operational until next year due to the deterioration of the rail system and the fluctuation in prices, the German newspaper reported.
According to reports in Die Zeit after an interview with a military spokesman, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruise ship, has now been postponed until the first quarter of 2019.
The train was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but the difficulty of bringing it in was a hindrance to the commissioning of the ship.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class trains purchased in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class trains.
The ships are reportedly equipped with heavy guns, fuel-propelled grenades, and other advanced weapons, such as aerial reconnaissance.
Other important features are that the ships can operate for a long time before they are ready - it is possible to operate them away from our ports for two years.
However, the delay in the start of the trains - which would have affected Germany's foreign operations - means that they will be operational once they are fully operational, Die Zeit reported.
The refusal to commission the F125 became popular last year, when the German navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the authorities had returned a train to a shipping company.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not clear, but German newspapers reported that there were "problems with the necessary programs and resources" on board which rendered the ship useless when it was used.
The complexity of the program was a major factor, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg trains would carry 120 passengers - half the military crew on the old Bremen trains.
Moreover, the heavy load of the ships was found to reduce the efficiency of the work and to pressure the authorities to improve the efficiency of the ships.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as the ships used by the German military during World War II.
Apart from the defects of the ship's construction, the cost of the entire operation of the ships - including training sailors - is disruptive.
It is reported that its revenue reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with these ships are becoming more important as the German navy's technology is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's security committee, admitted that the authorities were "missing the train".
The elder said that the problem had been a long one because old ships had been abandoned but had not been replaced.
He noted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were suitable for the naval forces.
The National Trust is surveying the lives of bats
A new study in a building in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how turtles use geography to hunt for food.
We hope that these findings will also provide insight into the new features of these unique birds and help to improve future care.
The research, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will focus on the best-known species of soprano pipistrelles and the brown-headed and Daubenton-headed butterflies at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed around the required area to monitor the activity of the fleas throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct research by traveling through different locations using mobile research tools.
Experts will test the sound recordings to determine how many times the ticks are called and what colors they are.
A map of the locations of the reporting sites can also be made to provide more information about the locations and their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a safety consultant at NTS, believes that the results will reveal areas of critical importance to moths and how they are used by each species.
This will help to appreciate the value of care for their environment, such as planting good grass and caring for the wood of the moths and other related species.
The numbers of bats in Scotland and the UK have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are at risk of construction and development that affect how moths gather for rest during the day and the loss of their habitat.
Wind and light systems can also pose a risk, such as fly-trapping paper and other building materials, and cat food.
The tongue is not blind in any way.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more effective than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated method to detect flying insects and obstacles.
NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important farms and 76,000 hectares nationwide, considers turtles to be of great importance.
It has ten highly trained specialists, who often conduct research, inspect the locations where the turtles gather to rest during the day and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The association has also set up one and only shelter in Scortland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of Scottish turtles.
The park manager, David Thompson, says that the location is ideal for them.
"Here in Threave we have the best place for moths", he said.
"We have old houses, old trees, and all the good land.
But there is much about the moth that is currently unknown, so the work we do here and in other facilities will help us to understand more about what it needs to survive".
He also noted the need to investigate ants before repairing houses because destroying one of the locations of the moth's reproductive system could kill 400 female and baby ants, and that could kill all the ants in the area.
Tongues are protected and are not allowed to kill, torture, or disrupt or damage their environment.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged people to do the same.
"We still have a lot to learn about our tongues", he says, "and we don't know how many of our languages are".
Ronaldo refuses to rape, and his lawyers try to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the allegations of rape are "false stories", saying that people "want to brag" about his name.
His lawyers wanted to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the article.
The Portuguese forward with Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was reportedly paid $375,000 to not report the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the reports as "false stories".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What he said today, is a lie", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said via camera.
"They want to exalt themselves by using my name.
Not unusual
They want to be known by my name, but that's the kind of work.
I am a happy and good person", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they say are "unconstitutional reports of suspicious privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the actor could seek compensation for his moral degradation to the extent of the scope of the case, which should be the most serious human rights violation in recent years".
The incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after his remarks and told him that he was "99%" "good guy" who failed with "only 1%".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but it was after a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police station where pictures of her injuries were taken from the hospital, but later agreed to resolve the matter on her own because she felt that she was "scared of retaliation" and worried about "public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to change her decision to resolve the matter on her own while continuing to be hurt by what she claims happened.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he moved to Juve, Italy's biggest club, for a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will 'regret forever' with the loss of carmakers
The UK will "regret forever" if it loses its position as the world's number one car maker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it could temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need unity", Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said the delay at the border if no deal is reached on Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year with 90% exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we can see production jobs stop in our factory", says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Some UK automakers have expressed fears about the issue of leaving the EU without an agreement on how international buying and selling will be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
A major concern for carmakers is what they say is the uncertainty of the issue of goods being delivered to consumers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota manufactures its cars "on demand" by its customers, with car manufacturing products arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers on demand vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border disruptions that industry claims could cause delays and a shortage of vehicle manufacturers.
It is unlikely that Toyota will have a one-day production at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production could be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union "is set precisely to avoid delays on the border".
"We want to have a partnership that is as good as it gets, which allows, as I say, not just a story of success at the moment but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the most successful approach to delivering products to consumers".
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but in time, it showed that the extra pay could reduce the factory's sales rate against other factories and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite co-ordinator at the factory, says that his members are deeply concerned: "In my experience these jobs will never return.
"We have established a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU", the official said.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House officials say
The summit of Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the battle against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, officials at the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates election disruption in Russia, the alliance between Trump's aides and Russia and what the president can do to disrupt justice.
The issue of whether Trump will remove the chief justice of the state, thereby undermining Mueller's rights, has been a source of rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed putting on a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by virtue of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were reports that he was retiring.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to remove Rosenstein from his post but the meeting was later postponed to coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate for a week the charges against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date for this is not set, it may be this week, and I can see that it is delayed by another week considering all the other high court proceedings.
But we'll see how it goes, and I like that the press is up to date".
Some journalists may dispute this: Sanders has not had a press conference at the White House since September 10.
His roommate Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the decline in attendance was not due to the "TV" media's hatred of "popularity", although he said: "I cannot deny the fact that they are popular".
He then said direct communication between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any president who has ever lived", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We have examined those numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to interview the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We are doing this very hard, and you have seen us do this a few weeks ago, and this will be instead of a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States".
Trump always answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends a meeting or interview with a dignitary.
Private press conferences are limited.
In New York this week the president may have shown the reason, making a free and sometimes unexpected appearance before the press that had gathered.
Health secretary writes to EU NHS Scotland staff over Brexit fears
The health secretary wrote to EU staff at Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and demanding that they remain on Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months ago to the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to ensuring that the application fee is paid to EU citizens who are working for it.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, talks between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal are continuing, and I hope that elections will be held at the end of this rainy season.
But the UK Government also urged preparations for what would happen if there were no agreement.
I know that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat now how much I appreciate the contributions of each worker, no matter where they come from.
My friends from all over the EU, and beyond, come as professionals who are instrumental in improving health services, and helping patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you here".
Christion Abercrombie Surgery After Headache
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery for a head injury on Saturday when his team lost 31 of 27 to the Vanderbilt Commondores, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred near the end of the first quarter.
"He came to the side and then passed out", Reed said.
Teachers and doctors put Abercrombie on oxygen on the court immediately before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the hospital for treatment.
A former head of the Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no record of his injury" and that the Tennessee State Department is investigating the exact time of his injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing for Tennessee State for the first time since moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he had blocked and knocked down the other team's players five times, resulting in 18 blocks and knocks.
Foreign buyers will be taxed higher when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when buying land in the UK and additional funds will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
The idea undermines the success of what Corbyn did to entice young people to vote for him
Additional taxes will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Economists expect to earn 120 million pounds a year - helping the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when they buy land in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The idea seems to have hampered the success of what Corbyn has done to entice young people to vote for him with promises of providing affordable housing and directing the highest-paying candidates.
Additional taxes will be paid to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funds will support the Government's policy to tackle the problem of sleeping under bridges.
Additions - which include the current tax, as well as the higher levels introduced two years ago on old homes and rent-purchased homes - can be as high as three percent.
Economists expect to earn about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first time buyers to create a first-tier home ownership.
Many of the country's wealthier areas - especially in the inner cities - have become "desert villages" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new law comes just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that taxes should be cut to help more young people get their first home.
He denounced the large construction companies for raising house prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to give up her shares in cheap houses to make up for Britain's "housing shame".
Corbyn has announced a list of beautiful new housing plans, including improvements in rent and "no fault" removal.
They also want to give the councils greater power to build new buildings.
"Last year", says Mrs. May, "I said I would give up my first assignment to rebuild the British dream - to make life better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a better life here.
However, it may not be accurate that it is easy for people outside the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy a home as hardworking British citizens.
For many people, owning a home is considered impossible, and sleeping under bridges remains a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to coach the Scottish team
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says that his "main goal" is to become a coach for the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old, a native of Scotland, is enjoying a refreshing career at the North-East club, which currently sits third in League One, with three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B grade and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up and helped Scotland in Hampden a lot with my father as a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come only if I have been successful in managing clubs".
Ross' first as manager of Sunderland was Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the names of the biggest club in the world, having rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success so far will be determined by the answer to the question ' can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
"Given the design and features of the club, it is clear that it is a Premier League club", he said.
"It's a very difficult job to get there, but I feel like I'm a success with this club if I can get it back there".
Ross has spent just three years in his managerial career, having spent the majority of his career as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as a regular in the Hearts club's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to avoid relegation to the third tier, and he helped the nearby St Mirren club to win the Championship.
And Ross says he feels better now than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Perhaps it was time to make a big decision", he recalled, about coaching the Alloa club.
"I really believed that the job of supervisor was more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I had a good life at work, and I enjoyed other things.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things you should do each week.
I continue to be stressed and pressured by work but the work of a supervisor is very good for me.
I have always wanted to be in control, and now that I am doing so, I feel better than ever in my entire adult life".

The best time to drink is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research has found
The summer heat has benefited the struggling British liquor industry but has caused a lot of trouble in restaurants.
Alcoholic beverage vendors saw a 2.7% increase in sales of alcohol in July - but their revenue from restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser, who also writes the statistics, said: "The continued heat of the sun and England's long unexpected participation in the World Cup will make July's events similar to those of June, when liquor vendors saw a 2.8 percent increase, except for the restaurants that suffered the most.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June continued in July.
Both liquor and alcohol vendors are doing well compared to restaurants.
Food and beverage businesses also suffered during the summer, although they do not suffer as much as restaurants.
People seem to want to go out for a drink.
The well-managed sales of alcoholic beverages saw a 6.6 percent increase in the same month, and food sales fell by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, of the RSM's leisure and hospitality department, said: "The results are continuing on what we have seen happening since the end of April.
Climate change and social and sporting events have a major impact on the purchasing of goods in markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer, and a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in purchases is a major problem, especially with the increase in demand.
A long hot summer may not be a good time for food vendors and the passage of time will show whether the cold we experienced in August will provide the needed relief".
The volume of sales in liquor and restaurant shops, including recently opened businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new product releases.

One in five children has a private social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the number of fake Insta accounts.
This article added to the fear that pornography was being sent
Twenty percent of students said they have a big account showing their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - is creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the number of fake Insta accounts - according to the website in terms of Instagram photo sharing.
This article added to the fear that pornography was being sent
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean big account showing their parents, but they also have some confidentiality.
A mother who encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account noticed that the teenage girl was encouraging others to rape her.
The survey, of Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds to have two accounts, with half of them agreeing to keep private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is sad that many young people are tempted to create social networks that their parents and teachers do not know about".
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's fastest athlete and competitor and chairman Ian Beattie described the selection as a great opportunity for the sport's managers to benefit from his many international experiences over the past 10 years.
"Eilidh has a great deal of respect for all Scottish, UK and international athletes and we believe that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from bringing him into the squad", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I am eager to be the voice of athletes and I hope to really help and improve the game in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games among four Olympic gold medals and is now a well-known BBC sportscaster, was left unable to walk after suffering from a drug overdose.
"Last month I had a stroke", she wrote on Twitter.
I cannot walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether or not I would recover.
It was a difficult task, but I recovered, now I'm learning to walk again and today I'm doing speed!
Thank you for the encouraging message!
The advertisement for a milk press that compares women to dairy cows has generated mixed reviews on the Internet
A dairy machine company has dropped various reviews on the Internet and advertisements comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To "start" a quietly operating pump, Elvie's company has released a song with a humorous video promoting the freedom that that pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real women in a grass-fed cow barn dance a song with the words: "Yes, I stood down, but you can't see the tail" and "you wouldn't have known that these are not cow's breasts, they are my real breasts".
The song went on to say: "Pump, pump, I'm breastfeeding the children, pump, pump, I'm hugging my mothers".
However, the campaign, which has been posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir on the Internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of reviews, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, many of whom say it portrays the "bad" aspects of the dairy industry.
It is a bad idea to use milk cows to advertise this machine.
Just as we must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, so too, unless their babies are removed within days of giving birth", wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump fits well inside the breastwear (Elvie/Mom)
"It's a pity for the mother and the child", says one.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps to nursing mothers?"
"This is a disagreeable advertising", added one.
Some liked the song, while one woman admitted that it was "funny"
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
The fear makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little unfair but I'm not angry about it.
This is a wise thing", wrote one.
"This is a fascinating ad about mothers who masturbate (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'milk cows,'" said one.
This is not a commercial to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they all danced with secret pumps.
The idea behind the ad is based on the understanding that many breastfeeding mothers say they feel like milk cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, works quietly, has no wires or tubes and fits well into the breastplate, giving mothers freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go elsewhere at the same time they pump.
Ana Balarin, colleague and ECD at Mother added: "Elvie Pump is a new product so it should be introduced carefully and fun.
In comparing maternal and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the issue of breastfeeding and its complications, and to present in a fun and easy-to-remember way the freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has been the subject of a feature.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the show of designer Marta Jakubowski using this pump.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Clandestinely Into a Camp on the Texas Border
The number of children immigrating has increased despite the monthly border crossing being unchanged, perhaps because of the negative attitudes and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to provide children to aid workers.
Traditionally, many caregivers have moved to another country without a permit, and they fear they will lose their opportunity to live in the country by coming to seek a child to help.
The situation escalated in June, when government officials announced that those seeking to be smuggled and other senior members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints, and that they would share the same with the border authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had detained a large number of registered immigrants to help these children who had come by themselves.
The agency later determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the assistants or family members are in the country illegally, and many of these people are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we continue to hunt these people", says Albence.
To help the children quickly, the authorities enacted new laws requiring that some of the children appear in court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the practice, according to the housing workers.
Many will appear through a video camera, rather than through a direct channel, in submitting their petition to the immigration judge.
Those who may seem unworthy of help will be quickly returned to their homeland.
After spending a lot of time in tents, children may experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or flight, according to accommodation staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said the complaints are growing in large settings like Tornillo, whereas signs of childhood distress are often ignored, due to the size of such a site.
They added that bringing children to tents without giving them enough time to prepare or to say goodbye can cause the pain that many already suffer.
Syria urges the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces were illegally in the country, falsely claiming to be fighting terrorism, and that they would "be punished justly".
"It must leave immediately without any further ado", he said at the convention.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is coming to an end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
Damascus will continue "to wage this holy war until we have cleared all the territory of Syria" of all terrorist groups and "illegal foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly trained and trained Kurdish and Syrian Arab soldiers who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on duty in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that the situation was better for them to return, and he denounced "some western countries" for "spreading unnecessary fear" that made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have called on foreign countries and aid organizations to help those who wish to return", he said.
"They are involved in politics in a matter that should be a matter of public interest".
The United States and the European Union say there will be no further aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN ambassador says the recent Russian-Turkish agreement to establish a security base in the last of the Idlib rebel-held areas has allowed for further political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish alliance has prevented the massive persecution of civilians and Syrian-backed troops in the region, which has a population of three million.
Moualem, however, stressed that the alliance "has a deadline" and expressed hope that the military will only attack jihadists, including militants of the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be destroyed".
UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the newly formed government committee and opposition members to reform the post-war Syrian policy and establish a process for a successful election.
Moualem explained the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that the group's work should be aimed at "reviewing the current constitution of the country", and warning those who want to disrupt the project.
Why Trump's Second Triumph
With that in mind, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many viewers expect, justice and criminality terminate his leadership before his due date.
In what might be like "The most amazing end of leadership ever!"
From now on, there are no signs of viewers getting tired.
Since 2014, nighttime viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million nighttime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the most long-running shows with 3.5 million viewers per night of mainstream news.
"This is a problem that people are brought up with because it's not something we understand well", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes President after the Capitol collapses.
Nell Scovell, former comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another view,
He recalls a time when he took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said, ""Because it makes me laugh"," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is something interesting about this.
In fact, unlike anything else on television, news from Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and global economic health.
Stopping is a precious achievement that lucky viewers can accomplish.
And, it goes on to be an informed citizen who finds himself in a six-hour watch of a group of scholars arguing about how Bob Woodward uses "deep history" to get his book "Fear", a $15,000" Paul Manafort leather jacket ("a jacket full of extreme pride", the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scientific description of the abusive body parts for Trump, um.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"One of the things they do that makes it look like a real show is that they give you something to watch every night", said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of" Pawn Stars", on Trump's recurring show and daily events (deciding to fight the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
If you miss one part, you are left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home in the north of Kauai, but he was too busy inside watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN news.
He could not help but see that, not only with the case of Brett Kavanaugh, who is preparing to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee, but also with the future of the Supreme Court, which depends on the outcome.
"I remember when we did all the crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me to do so.
"I think it was a joke, but it's obviously true".

Large amounts of money are being spent on supporting midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees a large spending, thanks to the re-establishment of legislative districts that allowed two people to compete for the same seat.
A recent revision of the Pittsburg county map allows Conor Lamb, a Democrat, to take part - who also won his seat in another county in a recent special election.
Lamb is running for the Republican nomination for the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is now closely tied to the new 17th District.
Maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were changed in favor of the Republican Party.
The competition in the new 17th district has sparked a massive campaign spending campaign between the major economic groups, the Democratic Campaign DRM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the highly-anticipated special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The state has been a Republican-led state for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the state by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a small margin of victory.
U.S. Attempted to Punish El Salvador for China's Assistance, Then Returning
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already started working with Beijing, without any major ban from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until his colleagues removed the Trump Administration team.
Government officials decided to recall American ambassadors working in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent elections that no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties are only expected to be imposed in El Salvador, which received about $140 million in donations from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The penalties they seek, including suspending financial aid and refusing to issue visas, would have been painful in Central America, a country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings were progressing, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference in anticipation of a later one that discussed security and economics following the same conference last year that seemed to be a step forward in dealing with immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the interim authorities had expressed their desire for the convention to proceed, immediately ending any suggestion of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now preparing for the talks, now scheduled for mid-October, highlighting the importance of this meeting, the ambassadors said.
And three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any cruel messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the controversies raised by three American officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations in a confidential manner.
Their accounts were verified by the same foreign experts who are close to the authorities and reported this in a confidential manner.
Learn from the History
The next event could be the release of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's miscarriage of justice, which is now well documented in the public record.
Mueller says he is also investigating whether Trump's campaign was allied with Russia in disrupting our election system.
If the legislature changes leadership, Trump will find himself facing questions to answer to that body, as he prepares to meet again with voters, and perhaps eventually with a peer court.
There are many questions to be answered, and I am not saying that Trump's downfall is inevitable - not even the likes of Europe.
There are choices that we all on both sides of the US can make that will affect the length of the war.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to plot against Hitler, provided that West rejected him and supported the Czechoslovak citizens in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to escape the terrible years that followed.
The past has been achieved through this unique history, and the process of democracy can be accelerated or delayed by this.
Americans are experiencing several of these things right now.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein was in serious trouble since the paper also said he had proposed a secret photo shoot of the president and that the president was not fit for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times is a hoax.
"What will we do if the recent request to the F.B.I. to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's case is not sufficient or unfair - or if he has been confirmed as a judge in the Supreme Court despite sufficient evidence of rape and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote for the legislators who will make Trump answer to his charges?
If we fail this test, democracy will take a long time to come.
But I believe we are not failing, thanks to the education I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that used to live in my embassy.
He survived and then moved to the United States, where 60 years later I was sent to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swastika marks.
With such a legacy, how can I be hopeless about our future?"

Graham Dorrans, a Rangers player, believes he can play well for his team against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, following their strong match against Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers are set to beat the Australian side, giving them a second-place finish in the second qualifying round of the Europa League, mainly in Group G.
A knee injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans prevented him from playing his first game of the season until the day he tied Villarrea's team with a 2-for-2 score but he believes the Rangers could use his performance as a good start to big things.
"The points we scored were important to us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the stadium hoping that we could do well in the game and scored one point.
We may have won the race, but in short, the match was a good thing.
They did well in the first division and we did well in the second division, and we were the best team of the day.
On Thursday, there is a big UEFA match.
Fortunately, we can take all three points but it will be a very difficult game because they won their games but based on our home opponents and I hope we can stand and win the game.
The past year was a difficult one, especially with my injury and other changes in the team, but now things are in full swing.
The athletes are fine and the boys are having fun; the preparations are fine.
Perhaps we can build it up now, forgetting about the previous season and doing better".
Women are sleepwalking because they are afraid of retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would need care, few people spoke to their relatives about it.
About half of those surveyed in Nationwide said they talk to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had spoken to their children about this.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss that", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for better care if you do not discuss your needs ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you should receive care, since the decisions may be of value to the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay the bills.
Your source of choice for long-term care expenses may include traditional long-term insurance, a mixed-cost life insurance to cover these expenses or self-insurance of your assets - as long as you have funds.
Write down your legal documents: Fight legal battles while you are on your way.
Get a health care professional on your behalf to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals are following your needs if you cannot speak.
Also, consider including a lawyer in your financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions for you on your finances and ensure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Keep in mind the small details: Suppose your elderly parents are seriously ill and are in the hospital.
Can you answer questions about health and health care?
Write down that in detail to prepare you:
"It's not just the money that needs to be prepared, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are her remedies?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for that.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of the communication system, emergency services could not receive any information from Donggala, a region in northern Palu that is very close to a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here is more about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the largest city in Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a small valley on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake.
Donggala is a region stretching over 300 km (180 miles) off the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The district, which is under the administration of the district, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are key to the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala region.
Nickel is also mined in the province, but it is found mainly in Morowali, a coastal area facing Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have experienced several tsunami disasters in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean, and earthquakes are common.
Here is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Aceh, Indonesia, on December 26 in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several devastating earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter-long tsunami that destroyed hundreds of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed hundreds of people.
No tsunami has been recorded, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapses.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of visitors suffering temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the first son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, tampering with the report and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, a woman tried to call the police to report the crimes, but she took the phone away from her.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he claimed "not guilty, really" after being questioned, the network said.
Palin is charged with three misdemeanor Class A counts, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Senior Court
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with the report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
In 2016 Sarah Palin was criticized by senior military personnel for linking the alleged abuse of her son to PTSD that she claimed was caused by her military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The videos shared on social media show the exact timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu city when a tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors seek a strange death sentence for terrorism defendants in NYC
New York City judges are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is charged with terrorism in NYC and killing eight people - a strange verdict that has not been handed down by a state court since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car at Home Depot to commit a terrorist act on a bicycle road near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the road in October.
In asserting the validity of the death penalty, the jury must provide evidence that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight and "deliberately" seriously injured others, according to the law on the appeal of this verdict, which was handed down in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the trial, the Supreme Court found Saipov guilty of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder by fraudulent means, which are used by the Supreme Court in such cases, as well as of crimes against humanity and theft.
The case was "carefully handled and carefully considered", the judges said, describing Saipov's handling of the case as "a brutal, brutal and brutal one".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has hurt others, and has caused the grief of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the petition later said.
Five of the victims were foreigners from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York issued a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was handed down in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed disinterest in his actions in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt better about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told government officials that he was encouraged to do so after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to details about his case.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denied the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's representatives, said he was "disappointed" by the decision of the state prosecutors.
"We think the idea of seeking the death penalty rather than accepting a request to remain in prison and not have a chance of being released would add to the pity for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had already asked the judges not to impose the death penalty.
MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to 'call a crowd like war' today at a demonstration at the General Assembly.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be 'pressured' by the EU's Opponents - as one of Theresa May's advisers said that is the way to manage the EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, a former backbencher, told Birminghamers that the UK would have 'been out' by now if Mr Farage had been Secretary at the Brexit talks.
But Mrs May's challenge to restore the divided sections has been confirmed by the Brexit Opponents to take part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The official is trying to make his unofficial plan successful against Brexit supporters, EU candidates and the EU.
His allies insisted that they would continue to try to enter into a partnership with Brussels despite the opposition - and pressure the EU and Labour Opponents to choose between what they offer and 'disorder'.
Mr Bone told a conference entitled Leave Means Leave Solihull that he wanted to 'democrate the Brexit dealers'.
He also suggested that Farage should be involved and given the task of negotiating with Brussels.
'If they had been leading this matter, we would have gotten out of here,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit but we want to oppose the Brexit dealers.'
Commenting on the EU's opposition, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to enslave us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone denied the idea that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "It is not clear that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay".
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the exhibition, telling the press: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Being in the EU is not wanted by the people, the Opposition will not accept this, it is no longer needed by our party and the activists who are fighting hard for our election.
Please leave the EU and start listening to the people.'
To Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime minister keeps his office when he fulfills his promises.'
Farage told the audience that politicians should be "compulsively" if they are unfaithful in the 2016 election.
Now it is a trusted matter between us - the people - and our political system,' he said.
'They are trying to be unfaithful to Brexit and we are here today to tell you that 'we will not allow you to do this.'
In his message to the exciting crowd he added: 'I want you to pressure our politicians, who have unreliable views on Brexit.
'We call on the nation-state as a warring party to fight for Brexit and we will not rest until we have become an independent, free and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the struggling EU membership has passed through Birmingham before a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several critics raised banners that said the Anti-Brexit group will be launched this week.
The meeting was opened by Labour Party colleague Lord Adonis who sneered at the Conservatives over the security situation they had experienced with their computer program.
'These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system in the country and all the technology in Canada including, borderless disruption, free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit,' he added.
Warren wants to "think deeply" about running for president
Representative Elizabeth Warren says that she will "think deeply about the issue of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democratic member from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent opponent of President Donald Trump, hopes to be re-elected in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He is thought to be able to fight Trump in 2020
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with a district representative using a question-and-answer system since Trump took office.
A delegate asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for a mother to go to Washington to repair our broken government, including a high-ranking mother".
Another arrested for shooting to death Sims LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a suspected gunman who shot and killed an LSU Sims player on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET News.
He released a video of what happened on Friday, asking for help identifying the person seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered head injuries and eventually died", Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told reporters Saturday, on 247 Sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his partner and was killed by Simpson's gun.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being on the scene, to having a weapon, and admitted to having killed Wayde Sims with a gun.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 goals and 2.9 assists per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has a chance to win the World Cup by defeating Sebastian Vettel according to the rules
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in the penultimate game that the rules of the Mercedes team had a bearing on all the final sequences.
From the very beginning, Bottas got off to a good start and Hamiliton did not stop in both divisions and invited Vettel to compete against his team-mate.
Vettel then took the lead in the preliminaries which left Hamilton behind, failing to secure a win.
Mercedes came later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after driving the wheels which allowed the Ferrari driver to exit the interior freely at the risk of being rear-faced to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the line and was seventh in the first round finish on his 21st birthday.
He then led the main part of the race as he grabbed his tires to a fast finish and earned Kimi Raikkonen a fourth.
He later came to the preparation spot on 44 laps but was unable to increase his speed on the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had a good weekend and was a real spy to be honest.
The team has done a remarkable job of having two winners", says Hamilton.
This Was Not a Proper Way of Speaking With Physical Sign
President Donald Trump denounced Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the Senate's record shows that people are "cruel and evil and false".
"One of the most likely and best things that could happen a few days ago in the Senate is that, when you see anger, you see people who are cruel and angry and mean and lying", he said.
"You just see a secret story coming out of the band, but you hear it saying, "I didn't do this.
I did not do this".
Do you remember?
Did you, Dianne Feistein, publish it publicly?
Remember what he said... you were the one who made it public - "iii, iii, what?
Third, no, not at all.
I did not publish it publicly".
Well, let's say this.
Did we just get it out publicly?... No, we didn't", Trump added in a speech, which clearly indicates he was talking about the senate.
Feinstein received a letter detailing the Kavanaugh case brought by Ford in July earlier, and the matter was made public in September - but Feinstein denied that the announcement came from his office.
"I did not hide anything about the matter that came with Mr. Ford, I did not disclose it publicly", Mr. Feinstein told the Senate Committee, according to a report in The Hill newspaper.
"I was told it was a secret, and I kept it a secret".
Such a refusal did not appeal to the country's leader, who spoke at a tax court on Saturday as follows: "I assure you, this was not the right way to make physical gestures.
Maybe not, but it was the dirty gesture I'd seen".
Continuing to defend the nominated Supreme Court justice, who is accused of having sex with three women, the president said Democrats are using their claims to achieve their own ends.
"Their goal is to recover power by any means.
You see how cruel, violent, careless these people are, who are hurting the one who is trying to take power", the leader said, according to the Mediaite newspaper.
The Big Cup: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars responded to the abuse by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 in a return match on their home court last Thursday.
In the opening game, the Belfast Giants led by two goals, led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
But Dundee returned the two goals through Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, and Dwyer of the Belfast Giants led his team in scoring.
Francois Bouchard scored the same goal, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two more goals, which brought the Dundee Stars back to victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League game of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between these teams, and the Giants then won the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute with 3:35 left by Kendall McFaull, a second goal by Beauvillier by David Rutherford just four minutes after the first goal.
It was a busy opening period, as Sullivan returned the players to the door at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a chance to kick the goal that led to the teams' equalising goals at 15:16.
Dwyer boosted the Giants' first-round draft pick by hitting his second goal of the night in the bottom of the first period.
The Dundee team at home also came up with another skill, and Bouchard drank a similarly strong yoke in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played well in handing the ball to Nielsen who scored the Dundee goal which led the team to their first ever lead in the second half and added another goal which scored a total of five goals in the match.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games in a row, are preparing to face Milton Keynes in the upcoming game on Friday.
An Assistant Pilot Died Helping Hundreds of Passengers Escape the Earthquake
An assistant pilot in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after dying by helping a plane carrying hundreds of passengers land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued in the area, and many were trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
While his friends fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace on the rocking tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was left to help the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then flying at the airport, take off safely
Then he jumped from the same tower as he thought it was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says the decision has saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take us to a good hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the disaster management department in the country says it is difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to be rising while some bodies are still in the trash and many are not connected to check if they are still alive", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the organization.
Waves of up to six metres [6.5 ft] have swept through Palu and a funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing relief and other supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Things are being stolen from small shops everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a problem, but it can grow.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete any transfer operations.
Are you ready to do this?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that one person has not yet been found after the plane crashed into the water
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean, also announced that no one was ever found, after initially claiming that all the passengers were rescued when the plane crashed.
Air Niugini announced that by noon on Thursday, it had found one male missing.
It said that it is now working with the world's leading authorities, health authorities, and researchers to find the missing male.
The company is not open to any information about the poor man, such as his age or country of origin.
Boat owners in the area performed a miracle to save lives after the plane crashed into the water as it was expected to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Some officials have announced that seven people have been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Sunday, but all were recovering well.
The exact cause of the accident has not yet been determined and the exact circumstances of the accident have not been determined.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane crashed into the water just before landing at the airport.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had passed through the road.
Pilots Bill Jaynes say the plane flies very slowly when it says so.
"This is a wonderful thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to cross the water to the refuge on a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants pointed out the rings and were shouting loudly, adding that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working at nearby boat repair facilities helped more than evacuate people by taking them ashore using boats before the plane sank about 30 feet (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in plane crashes registered in PNG over the past 20 years but no one has been affected by Air Niugini.
Experts give a list of events leading up to the time of the burning of the mother alive
The prosecutor on Saturday stayed the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in a sophisticated analysis.
He explained to the court how he used cell phones to interfere with the movements of 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received information about the location from several cell phones that indicated Tellis had Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts her previous claims, Clarion Ledger said.
When he showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not in town that day.
When the jury asked if Tellis was correct in saying he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was in Nashville at the time".
Another disagreement is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
Evidence from cell phones suggests that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death,Tellis removed Chambers' records, many of which were singing with his name on his phone.
"They took him out of his life", Hale said.
The opponent is expected to make his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to court that same day.
High Breed: What is hip hop marijuana?
Three hip hop musicians are considering changing the perception of the flaws of marijuana by incorporating a message of encouragement into their music.
The Bristol-based band High Breed says that hip hop has stopped being a political and social instrument.
The idea of a guerrilla and restoring the influence of the marijuana music initially behaves as before.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A NY nanny sues a family for sending "discriminatory" messages
A child-care provider in NY is suing a couple for sending a racist message after receiving a lost message from the woman complaining that she was "someone black".
The couple denies any discrimination, saying that the case is "a form of theft".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment after discovering that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black after her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other kind of hatred", said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
Instead of sending the letter to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
Recognizing her mistake, "unstable" Plasco-Flaxm fired Sister Maurice, saying that her former child-care provider, an African-American, had done a bad job and was hoping to find someone from the Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day's wages and sent home on an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for their dismissal, and he wants to be paid $350 a day for six months, a concert project he was already working on before the contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you don't do things this way", he told the Post Friday and added, "I know it's prejudicial".
The pair defended themselves against allegations of racism, saying that firing Maurice was the smart thing to do, fearing that they would not believe him if he was offended.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He is not partial.
We are not racist", the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But will you give your children to a man whom you have wronged, even though it was not deliberate?
Your newborn?
You people".
Comparing the case to "theft", Plasco said that his wife was only two months pregnant and was "in a very difficult time".
"Would you go out and fight a man in that condition?
It's not the best thing to do", the banker added.
While the case is still pending, the court of public opinion has quickly criticized the couple on social media, criticizing them for their actions and attitudes.
The publishers of Paddington's book fear that readers will not be able to imagine a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is exciting to know now what we know about the great success of this Paddington book"
Regarding his father, before the former BBC artist was inspired to write a children's book with a little bear toy, it would be unfortunate to lose him, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "painful and pleasant" after his death last year.
Paddington's book, which he describes as "the most important part of our family", adds that his father was very proud that he had finally succeeded.
"He was a calm man, and he was not a violent man", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to her, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them even if you haven't.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Despite his designs and ideas, he always paid homage to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying, and I had to call her on the phone
Upon arrival she rushed with her daughter to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked in vain to try to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that it was really bad, and that he did not expect to recover", says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that she would die within two minutes and I had to nurse her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to treat her anxiety were gradually being released and eliminated from her body.
He had died a short time ago, and this was just the closing.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I cannot cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and others.
I needed to keep it to myself".
Later Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with others - unaware of the problems they were facing.
"No one knows", he said.
"I was on the ground, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to describe, but there was a trip that I felt for Nad.
That he wanted my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved me.
A grieving mother sends a suicide note on a bridge
Two sisters whose siblings died by suicide are trying to save others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending cards to the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Sister Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear how I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son had the privilege of being a good cook with a smile.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
She always says her smile illuminates the whole place".
However, he left his job before his death, "in great distress".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found dead after his brother committed suicide.
"I worry about the outcome", says Davis.
Sister Davis made the cards "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk, even with a friend.
Don't just be quiet - you have to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her husband, Mark, who had been a friend for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad or sad or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw how they changed.
They weren't very nice on Christmas Day - the children didn't look at them or say anything when they opened their presents".
He added that his death was a terrible loss, but he had to endure it: "It left the family in deep pain.
It divides us.
But we all need to keep going".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains unknown when the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that, if we could find anything like what they were asking for - such as a short-term, limited-scale survey - we could perhaps bring a little unity", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" during a fierce political war.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is due to events that were about to happen.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be very weak in trying to get a candidate to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been taking phone calls to the Senate, urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and through whom Bush met his secretary, Ashley.
What will happen when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to settle the case and convince him to the Supreme Court.
The number of rebels "declined" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who have become South Korean citizens has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers have said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's ministry of cooperation, said there were 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tight control of the border between North Korea and China and the high tariffs charged by smugglers are the reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not commented.
Many North Korean rebels are eventually granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
In China, the rebels are viewed as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often retaliated by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still at war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss previously failed nuclear weapons talks.
This came after a special June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work on a complete nuclear disarmament mission in their respective Korean countries.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said sanctions from the US were the main obstacle to the smooth flow of goods since then.
"Without America's trust we will not be satisfied with our national security and in these matters we cannot begin to abandon nuclear weapons ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the parliament Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said she had no intelligence to work for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had done this, she would have said 'crazy,'" Pelosi said in giving her opinion on what Kavanaugh would say as evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of raping Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening remarks, Kavanaugh was depressed, sometimes screaming and angry when discussing her family and her high school days.
He also denounced the Democratic Party's committee, calling the charges "malign and attempted smear" by liberal conservatives who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he should not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think they're getting fired by what they say and how they talk to the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was skeptical when asked if she would attempt to remove Kavanaugh by a vote if the nomination was confirmed, and if Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I can say is that - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the courtroom he's here for", said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that if a Democrat member was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh would appeal about the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a Democrat attorney.
In his affirmative hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a crazy, prejudiced person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'That's not right,'" said Pelosi.
And Wives Should Use This Method Properly.
With that righteous reproof, months and years of anger are flooding in, and they cannot bring it out without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Sister Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that strange, is it?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by an older woman who said she too cried when she was angry, but she made a plan so that when she got angry and started crying, she could say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry I'm crying.
I am angry".
And he keeps going.
And I thought it was a good idea".
Tears are allowed as a way to express anger because tears are not well understood.
One of the most memorable moments of my first job, I was in a crowded office, where I was once found crying with excruciating rage, was my being seized by an elderly woman - a gentle manager with whom I was always a little frightened - who pulled me up the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you crying", he told me.
"He doesn't know he's angry.
They think you are sad and happy to come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after being caught committing adultery on board a boat called Monkey Business that forced him to withdraw from the race, Schroede, deeply frustrated, decided that there was no reason why he should not consider running for president.
"He made a bad decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven others who wanted to enter the race, and the last thing they needed was one man.
One called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was a rushed campaign, he was behind in making money, and he decided that he would not enter the contest unless he had won $2 million.
This was a failure.
He found that some of his assistants who gave $1,000 to men should give him only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he was not running a proper campaign, it affected him deeply - thanking those who supported him, frustrated with the arrangements that made it difficult to raise funds and the arrangements to fight voters rather than representatives, and angry at the prejudice - it caused him to cry a little.
"You would have thought I was in a big trouble", Mrs. Schroeder recalls the way the press treated her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my company's sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?""
Light on how China can benefit from the ongoing conflict between China and the United States.
The war is still ongoing, but experts have found that the war could ultimately benefit China.
The beginning of this came when American president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on mainstream goods from China such as solar power, various metals, including aluminum.
The conflict seemed to have reached its climax this week when the United States ordered a massive $200 billion in goods to be shipped to the United States, or somehow to Britain's 150 billion pounds.
China has been responding to this outrage by imposing a tax on the United States, recently imposing a tax rate of between five and ten percent on U.S. property worth $60 billion.
China has said it will respond to the abuse in the same way that the United States would and will be vigilant.
To stop this trend, China must stop its cheap and attractive imports from the United States and openly confront China with its problems, which could bring reproach on the country's leader, Xi Jinping.
However, some experts suggest that the move could help China to reduce the bilateral relationship for a long time, if China makes a good decision.
"Abgail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New America Security and an expert on Asia, says that "an unprecedented political rationale has the potential to disrupt the economic development of the United States and China beyond what is anticipated".
Syria "ready" for refugees to return, says the Foreign Ministry
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country is getting better.
"The current situation is stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said
The government is continuing to rebuild the lands that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore order.
Everything is set in the present for refugees to come to the country they had to leave because of the terrorist and economic processes that affected their daily lives and their behavior.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that he would not receive any other necessary assistance or assistance from countries that supported the terrorists.
The European team has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating the USA by 16 1/2 points at the Le Gold National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has won the Ryder Cup six years in a row in European competition and has not won the trophy since 1993.
The European team, led by its coach, Thomas Bjorn, won the trophy again after scoring 14.5 goals to beat the United States.
U.S. team captain Phil Mickelson, who refused to show any signs of masculinity in the race, threw the ball into an unsuitable hole that gave his opponent Francesco Molinari a chance to beat them.
Italian players played exceptionally well in all stages of the tournament, making him one of only four players to score 5-0-0 in the 1979 tournament.
American Jordan Spieth was not disappointed when he lost by 5&4 points to European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not reach the real mark.
The world's most famous player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 for 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup championship.
Ryder Cup champion Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become Europe's most successful player with 25.5 points during his playing career.
"I'm not crying, but I can't help myself today.
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to our teacher Thomas for his admiration and trust in me.
I am so happy, and I am glad to have received the cup again.
The goal was for our team to win, and I am happy to have been a part of that victory", said Garcia, who looks very excited about his European team's success.
He thanked fellow citizen John Ram who defeated US Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"I am most proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, as I grow up watching him play", said Rahm, 23.
Woods won all four matches in France and has now managed to secure a victory in the Ryder Cup which has come to a 13-21-3 record.
This is a daunting feat considering that this is one of the world's greatest champions, having won 14 races and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to get the best results except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf in all competitions.
US general manager Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing game in his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've worked hard.
There was a time this morning when we were harassing the European team.
We fought a war.
All due respect to Thomas.
He is a good leader.
All 12 of his players have played well.
Let's get some more done, I can work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll make progress.
I love all 12 of them and am proud to be their leader.
You may well be.
Let's face it, our teammates played better than us".
More on the Red Waves: The number decreases in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a sharp decline in Red Tide rates in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, red wave zones are being found in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - indicating a decline in numbers.
The Red Wave erupts about 130 miles [130 km] of shoreline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
The areas are also located 10 miles upstream of Hillsborough County, but in less areas than last week.
Red Waves were also seen in Pasco County.
Average coastal concentrations in Pinellas County were reported last week, low and high concentrations in Hillsborough County, low and high concentrations in Manatee County, low and high concentrations in Sarasota County, low and high concentrations in Charlotte County, low and high concentrations in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Breathing problems continue to be reported in the towns of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory problems have been reported in Northwest Florida this week.
