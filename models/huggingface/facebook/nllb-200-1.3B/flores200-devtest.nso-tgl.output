Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. Most of the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than they are.

Ocelots are looking for their prey by blending into their environment and then leaving their prey. The Ocelots are also known for their ability to see well in the dark with night vision, and they move slowly, too.
