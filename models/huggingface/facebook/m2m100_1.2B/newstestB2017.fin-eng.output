28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Center
A 28-year-old chef who just recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim’s brother says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found in a Westfield shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, according to the San Francisco Forensic Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a murder.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job as a chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters restaurant spokesman said the death was a shock for them all.
“We’re a small and tight team, like a family.
“Our thoughts are with Frank’s family and his friends.”
Louis Galicia says that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally gotten his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and big heart.
His way of being together with the family was to make food for us all,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the river.
Despite all the injustice that was happening in the world, he was an unleashable diamond that shone every day,” he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Striking medical workers call for new struggle
Representatives of British junior doctors (which in Finland are mostly specialized doctors) have appealed to their trade unions and sought permission for new labour struggle actions in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling on its entire government to support further work struggle from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, the ministers have not resolved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the voting members rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, tweeted on Thursday night a letter to JDC members, saying the board had "insistently silenced" on issues that, McCourt said, led to the rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: “In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted completely against the new draft agreement and is demanding that any of our concerns be re-formally negotiated.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board of Directors has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Board of Directors asking for permission for gradually expanding labor struggle from the beginning of September.”
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete downtime ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
BMA’s junior doctor’s director, Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members at their pre-voting meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and would apply to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of foreigners?
It was the act that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to reach a settlement and to formally end the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish official in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides handed out,
But Putin’s smile seemed weak, and he was barely warm even with his own restrained measure.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr. Putin – according to one report five times.
I did not keep my bills.
He also said that relations with Russia will be better than they were before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s newspapers that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I felt his enthusiasm was just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction to the incident was outrageous.
Putin attacked Ankara with harsh words and accused it of kicking his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting true trust back will be difficult, even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan strongly denies the accusations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to get Putin’s apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have won a victory.
The benefits of a strict ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
Reconciliation also has an economic impact.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey heavily, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to the coast of Turkey every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely squeeze of relief when air traffic can eventually continue.
They put their faith in a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall when imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” the newspaper Vedemost wrote.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes the West is responding to a coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old outrage over Turkey’s ongoing EU accession negotiations and Putin’s lack of interference in matters, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool ties and break Turkey’s ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own obsessive concerns about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, at their summit in the palace on the coast of the sea, were able to convey a picture that one analyst described as a “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that feel rejected by the West and ill-treated are uniting forces.
Despite the public reconciliation, the two still have major disagreements.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacebuilder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
After three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they hadn’t discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could seek a consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete catastrophe caused by NATO member Turkey by shooting down a Russian fighter jet, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility these two heads of state are once again even in conversation.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to RBS, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only offer business services – so-called back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds in international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands in the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeste, except for the headquarters and stock exchange.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff at the Inverness Show.
He told BBC Scotland, “RBS is turning into an investment brand and that’s why we’re employing our staff because we’re now turning into a bank of a lot more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different within their community, and our staff work with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations Rugby, and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsorship of the sport.
“Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because the question is basically how we can make the bank better for our customers,” said the bank’s CEO.
“Three years ago, it would have been very wretched if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have adopted brands.
But the work we do and the focus on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rides Predilection to victory at Newmarket and achieves his 3,000th win
Dettori drank champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant him 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory at the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the track of his own location.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing on a flat track.
He has previously been featured by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion hockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because that’s where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition event is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday evening and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility.”
Dettori receives greetings with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have achieved milestones in blockbuster races, and they are champion-jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical advantage is what sets him apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, and his enthusiasm and excitement has brought fans to the race for years.”
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he’d already won 6,000 races if he didn’t compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie’s race in the UK has been winning for 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He’s a vibrant personality, which is good for British racing, but above all he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori featured his accomplishment in a symbolic way by flying down from his horse.
“From flying finishes to flying naked earnings, Frankie Dettori has been a role model in British racing for two decades.
There are up and downs on the road.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 in the "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived an aircraft crash and has been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had top start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable character strength, showed his doubts and returned to his best.
And he’s not about to end his career yet – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until at least he’s 50.”
Putin removes Chief of State Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned his chief executive Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, is now appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that President Putin “decided to dismiss Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but no reasons for his resignation were disclosed.
Anton Vaino has been appointed as Ivanov’s deputy chief since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol department and the government chancellor, the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the main task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.”
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had himself requested his resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close friend of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As chief executive, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
During a meeting on Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanov would resign at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of a power struggle?
No one knows it yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, in which he says: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I’ve been in office for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was previously thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, Putin’s next president, Dmitry Medvedev, is in charge.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios released a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner had apologized on Thursday before he was announced to be fired.
“We had creative disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a statement.
Gibson, 54, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since its first season, in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
“I hoped to see the series until the end, but it’s not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the screenwriters, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the series could ever have hoped for.”
Season 12 will start production in the U.S. on September 28.
The Mysterious Beaching of Fish in the Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windshields that have fallen to the ground as they are absorbed by a storm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the shore, posted footage of the sight on Periscope and hoped to get a response to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry crossings are joined by FIFA.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern edge and land bridge of the Queensferry Transit Bridge, meaning the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It’s the first of four sections between the “front lines” that are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 winged corner wheels.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Cabinet Secretary of Economy Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing Bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge. More than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this part of the bridge alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge roof is a subtle operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
Almost 79 percent of the entire bridge cover is now in place, and the rest of the cover is getting its concrete cover in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be raised.”
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “The completion of the first part of the bridge is always a major milestone in any bridge construction.
In this fantastic project, this percentage represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
Once the last part of the roadway was installed and connected to the roadway of the North Tower Pillar, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. land-side) section.
This was done by pulling the ground from the north side 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time high-precision operation.
It is massive because it has a length of 222 meters and weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 percent.
And requiring high precision, because the tolerances that the working team had to observe were very small – just a few millimeters.
Fortunately everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay rescue agency announces miraculous rescue of three men
In front of Anglesey, the three men who got into the water from their fishing boat were saved by miracle.
Moelfre RNLI’s marine rescue station issued an alert on Friday at 13:20 local time after its crew detected an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued its careless passage without a pilot.
“We saw the boat running right next to them and we imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, who runs the rescue boat at Moelfre.
"Until we got into the waters, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two men, while the third, a 60-year-old, was found exhausted, stuck in a boy and without a lifeguard.
They were all taken to the rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: “It’s a miracle that these three men who fell into the water are still alive and perfectly healthy.
The boat’s engine had an emergency shooting bar, but it had, for some reason, disconnected from the man who drove the boat when it crashed.
They were really lucky on the journey.”
Pokémon Go brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and look at their boxes.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and move.
Initially, screen time was only spent watching TV, then there were also video games and, most recently, smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor sports do not rule out each other.
Pokémon Go is a gaming app with characters from video games created in the 1990s (which later became a series of cartoons, game cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this was also a little overdue before the new game was released in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for Pokémon with their smartphones, which can be tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using a phone screen) or "captured".
Villitys has grabbed the generation that played video games as younger and raised the back of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the “average person” takes per day.
The Washington Post recently on the Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which detected within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people who moved 30 minutes a day suddenly increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees raw data on the amount of movement.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get out of the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have rattled into deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
With regular exercise, the likelihood of developing cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people out to do something they enjoy.
Thus, it achieves three basic health-supporting things – exercise, fresh air, sun and pleasure.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes unpleasant pleasures.
And yes, someone can walk toward the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been made.
Because while smart phone apps like Fitbit may have tracked your activity in the past, they didn’t give you a reason to get started, like Pokémon Go does.
The news enthusiasm disappears, and the use decreases over time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which increases the fitness of people on the hunt and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's rack gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
The dynamic jump.
Difficult to bear.
Stir with Permanent.
Great in everything.
And finally an Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday, adding to the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the eye of the Olympic Games.
His total score of 62,198 was clearly better than the silver-placed "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will be featured in the boomerang of the single multi-match final of the women’s rack gymnastics competition on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman ever to win the multi-match championship.
Biles burst into tears when his final total points came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the genre into a completely new dimension and elevates it to the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been entirely superior in his kind for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and accurate programs that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest rack gymnast of all time."
In Brazil, there was yet another final race, which took place primarily between Biles and the burden of himself and his excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Springs with less than a handful of gold medals would be disappointing.
U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver in the single multi-match final of the women’s rack gymnastics competition on Thursday at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as a point over the i for the country team coordinates and now retired Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while on top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a series of volts known as his winning card – has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not coincidence.
Adopted by his grandparents as a child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother has become a power figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a kindergarten visit in the gym where Boorman trained.
He hasn’t lost a single multi-match race since the summer of 2013, and the win line will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small thread with two spirals, it was like a fabric.
The rest were the boom and the permanto, where Biles is a defensive world champion.
He returned to the lead after getting 15,433 points and crowned the final score with 15,933 points.
Raisman hugged him gently as they waited for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ glowing red, white, and blue finishes when his dream, once written in his sketchbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge to the race four years ago, when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-rounds.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team's "mama", was clearly ahead of Mustafin.
He sent airbags to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from losing to winning, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, the tweet that this 19-year-old made earlier this week and spread widely now has an entirely new meaning:
Police say a serial killer who listened to music in a car was the victim
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, the victims were sitting in the car and listening to music while they were shot, police said in a statement released Thursday.
Authorities said on June 12 that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the side of the street.
The gunman stood on the passenger side of the car, shooting eight shots with a handgun and then escaping with another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the murder was not caused by a robbery, as the attacker did not take away his handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman sergeant Jonathan Howard said police are now investigating whether the killing was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin-American-inhabited areas within four months.
“It’s common to the events that they occurred in residential areas in front of homes,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what made them conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their agent is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital due to his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’s daughter Maleah died immediately on the scene.
A witness told the police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a statement in which it was that the shooting was directed at an empty package car only half an hour before the three killed.
The researchers found the shells and picked up a bullet from the car seat and fragments of the bullet from the motor room.
Mother of 6-Year-Old Boy With Microcephaly: "Things Are Getting Better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a congenital microcephaly caused by a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciutto, of which he was unaware when he was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I’t get through this.
I do not get through this.
I am not committed to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and may not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they suggested placing the child in the hospital.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t believe there was such a practice anymore,” says Piccido.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund got up sitting down and started cuddling only at the age of 3, and he still doesn’t speak.
He moves slowly at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She loves to play with her two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces the sign she invented by Edmund, which she means "Sing to me".
“We’re teaching him the sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes sign languages invented by Edmund himself.
The background of microcephaly can be a number of different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how this affects the lives of people affected by the Zika virus.
Piccido recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
“I am constantly asking, ‘What will happen to us?’
How is it going to us.”
And he still does not know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction for a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciutto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things are usually arranged.
You love your child and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods have caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding.
According to the National Weather Service, several of the south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi rivers are flooding over their edges and spreading over a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flooded areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor’s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will continue until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service, there could be another 76–127 mm of water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said many houses along the rivers could be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which runs south of the border with Mississippi, in Liverpool, Louisiana, rose at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescue work continued in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and sons were among the rescued earlier Friday near the Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
A young man nearby warned him.
“We got up, and the water came with a constant feed,” says Hansford.
“It reached my waist.”
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says he and his family have all the injuries, and he is the only one who is able to swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three in a large military-style truck and taken them to the fire station at Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells information from an observer near Livingston that between midnight and Friday morning there had been almost 350 mm of rain.
Krautmann said the soil was heavily wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that because of heavy rains and flooding streets, residents of Tangipahoa County were rescued from their homes and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the city council told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS television and radio, that 200 homes were under flooding.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County Chief Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
Refugees have been evacuated in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
“They’ll be able to go back to their homes when the water starts to retreat,” she says.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were forced to close due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
“The last time we experienced a major flood in March,” says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city council.
“This flood looks similar.”
In Mississippi, rain continued steady along the Gulf coast, said Rupert Lacy, rescue chief of Harrison County.
Lacy said there were reports of a handful of flooded houses on Thursday, but there were no reports on Friday so far.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before, and it’s raining all the time.”
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which is the second six-year-old boy to be shot in the city this week.
The child’s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several shot wounds in the hip, thigh, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of shots, his little body was filled with bullets," the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
“I can’t believe this true.”
He is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the television company that the boy is expected to survive.
He was starting first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
The condition of the second 29-year-old was to be critical and the other two were stable, CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with assault-type shells, which come from various types of assault weapons.
“It is clear that this is a struggle.
There were hills on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to reports, police are going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was struck by an illusion while she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabbie, and Laurie
By this name I call the women’s rack gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Second, the three gymnastes of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team’s composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team will finally represent America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose to be the surprise winner of the games, and the whole of America applauded.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful rack gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual multi-match.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The outlook is like that at the top of the species, but it doesn’t look like it at shelf gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They’re the last five (“Final Five”), as the next rail gym Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics are mainly practiced in private rack gymnastics clubsined by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, performance accommodation, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnastics and family members) etc.
The facilities of most shelf gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The teaching of gymnastics takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnastics families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained the race enthusiasts since they started rail gymnastics.
We need to provide more affordable and more accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have provided free or low-cost access to rack gym enthusiasm to more than 15,000 city youths (mostly black and Latin Americans), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality rack gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Rack gymnastics develop strength, agility and body coordination and teach hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings sustainable benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has aroused the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who are now looking to get started with rack gymnastics, and that’s pretty awesome.
Participation in any sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real “girl power” you showed in winning the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their path to become prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt’s proposal and prepare for new strikes
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes in wages and working conditions by approving a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 percent of the 37,000 junior physicians who voted against the proposal.
Health Minister Hunt said in July of plans to force the deal, saying the UK’s public health care system (NHS) is “no one’s land” and that any further delays will be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care during antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, Chair of BMA’s Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement last night, saying: “Junior physicians remain very cautious about the proposed agreement.
There are only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward as time is running out.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has rejected the attempts to discuss and sometimes even reacted in no way.
I did this despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, revoke the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors are ready for new work fighting measures."
The previous strike in late April postponed 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to join the strike guard to support striking doctors.
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over the amendments by concluding a revised agreement with the staff of the British physicians union.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the deal.
NHS chief of staff Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors not to go on strikes.
Mortimer says: “Work fighting can very little or nothing, but it creates pressure on teams and services that already operate at their limits and causes concern, distress and disturbance to patients, healthcare personnel and their families.
We have been in talks with the Junior Medical Committee for the last two months, and together with the Ministry of Health and others we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of misconduct.
The staff were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other key topics – such as development, training flexibility, further training for those returning from a break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, school leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – were a sign of how serious the workers, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health are about to stick to their agreements with BMA in November, February and May.”
A medication costing approximately €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug that costs around €2.40 a day, when the authorities recommended it to be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anticoagulant tikagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in heart patients.
The drug is currently administered 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has advised that tikagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the British Public Health System (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has advised that tikagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, with a quarter of them recurring to a heart attack or having a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fatty substance accumulated in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can give rise to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot dissolves, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Manufactured by British AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, it reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
Today’s NICE draft program recommends taking 90 mg of tikagrelor for the next 12 months, then reducing the dose to 60 milligrams and taking aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for the Evaluation of Implementation of Treatment (NICE) says: “Al there are effective treatments available to prevent disease progression and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have evidence that tikagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of tikagrelor adds treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it.”
Because data on the effectiveness and safety of tikagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, is limited when used for more than three years, the draft program does not recommend the use of the treatment for a longer period.
Because of the political correctness climate, voting falsehood in Muslim regions flourished
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was fired from office last year due to corruption.
The climate of political correctness has led to the closing of eyes on widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report released today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has harshly criticized police, election observers and city councils for closing their eyes to electoral fraud "because of their over-sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
According to Pickles, who is known as a former regional government minister and a current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have been allowed to set up guard chains outside polling stations to protect feared voters.
He proposes that voters should present an identity card to be able to prove their identity when going to vote.
At the moment, voters only have to state their name and address.
Furthermore, the report suggests that the fingers be soaked in the outgoing ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Those whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access for journalists to State Council documents and informal committee and working group decisions.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and the culture of favouring them in the wider local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the East London Tower Hamlet poll scandal.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that then-mayor Lutfur Rahman should resign from office due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman had "evasively distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to “use as the basis of his campaign the fact that it was the religious duty of every believing Muslim to vote for him.”
Of the votes, up to 300 were questioned or given fraudulently, in such a way that a person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election scam, in which senior members of the Muslim community werely pressuring people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: “There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of older members.
“There was concern that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of their “politically correct” hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing mail voting tickets in order to prevent “vote collection.”
Theresa May’s current report also calls for stricter checks in connection with registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of options that would require voters to present an identity document before voting.
Soak your fingers in the outgoing ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automated postal voting.
Prohibiting political activists from handling filled votes sent by post and voicemail envelopes.
Police have the right to establish chains of guard around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the imposition of intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only English permitted at polling stations (except for Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff oversee the rule that only one person can go to the polling station at a time.
Sir Eric has criticized the police in London and said it is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlet case.
“The arbitration court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices,” he says.
"He was found guilty without any real suspicion and the criminal proof threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the inefficient "check-up checks" by the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the city council.
“The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up,” says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by some concerned and hidden electoral fraud and its prohibition."

CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's's analysis of the fourth place for 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle message shocked viewers of CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "lost of smell" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he began to express his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4 x 200 meter freelance final.
MacDonald, who was taken with CBC’s reporting team to bring color, was heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg is yours, baby.
He was too excited, went away in a hurry and died like a pig.
Thanks for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message at 1:57.79, and was 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Ruck, giving the Canadians a chance to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the commentator’s tone and language usage.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese caterpillar died like a pig????
The idiot did not realize that he was still on the broadcast."
In the final of the women’s 4 x 200 meter freestyle, the Chinese Ai Yanhan was described with the following words: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious comments criticizing Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
Tweeters didn’t hold on to their words when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeted by Sarah Paradis: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, quickly apologized for MacDonald’s remarks: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that this happened.”
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator Scott Russel was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and glued its apology to more than 90 other tweets complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The company also made a public apology.
“We sincerely regret these statements and that they went on broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers at last night’s broadcast, and we also apologized to our followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald expressed his apology on the broadcast and tried to defend his remarks by saying he did not intend it to be personal.
“I would like to apologize for my comment that I made yesterday evening following the messaging of women,” MacDonald said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
“I referred to the swimmer’s performance, not the person.
Obviously, I didn’t mean anything degrading with my words, and I’m very sorry.”
A woman who arranged underwear in the middle of a store at Primark shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when the woman disguised herself in the middle of the Primark to match her underwear.
She further aggravated the situation by evaluating what she looked like in her underwear, taking them off her foot and putting them back on the shelf.
She continued her tour and eventually tried four pairs of underwear at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store located in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying out underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear from the shelf, took off her own t-shirts and underwear and put them on her.
He did not try to do it unnoticedly, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone looked at him as he took off the underwear he tried and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
She did it three more times before finally deciding that she didn’t like them at all, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks—and didn’t think of a person who would eventually buy the underwear he had put on.”
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I have understood that the shop staff was trying to remove the clothes from the sale when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be awful to bring the new underwear home and find that someone else has put it on without it being washed,” adds Davidson.
A Primark spokesman commented on the matter, saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video on Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, a New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association, and asked for advice on how to survive a robber or murderer whispering a gun nearby.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from ahead or from behind.
If the attacker approaches backwards, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shot line, says Mizrachi.
Then hold the gun between your elbow and shoulder, and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with a knee in the hip, and when he goes twice the pain, scratch him in the face with a pistol pipe and retreat by holding the gun directed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You must move away from the shooting line, grab the weapon and spin it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a thumb in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker’s grip, retreat and hold the gun targeted at the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
See in the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to give up your cash – unless you’re a Krav Maga great master.
World Travel Guide Ian Wright Smacks the Dirtyest Places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resilience and catchment reflexes to the test by licking some of Europe’s dirtyest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by slicing a euro banknote, a wristband in the Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet wash button, and a Russian public phone.
Before sliding, Wright measured objects with a lumen to see for himself and to show the spectators where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was filmed in the documentary Ian Wright: In the Trail of the Inner Force, and the results were surprising.
The idea of licking the washing button in a train toilet may be overwhelming, but in fact there are more bacteria in the kitchen drawer.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening good bacteria in the gut and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he struck caused anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the railway stations’ handrails and the toilet rinsing button undoubtedly challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, “Since I was a child, I’ve been quite concerned about my health and injected all sorts of things into my mouth, including soil, worms, and currants.”
In the film, he really proved to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a rough public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The limit came at a public toilet in Russia, where Wright refused to slide when the luminometer measured the result of 4,000 units – in newly washed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright joins Valio in the documentary produced by Ian Wright – The Trail of the Inner Power, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: “This is almost the worst smell I’ve ever smelled in any toilet.
Nothing is more dirty than that!
The place is so upsetting that I really don’t spit anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright: The Inner Force in collaboration with Valio.
From Vali Wright was given Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s category manager for snacks, juices and new products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something entirely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time speaks about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian for us.”
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
“Rather than just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and this document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
It also shows our sense of humor.”
Tom Hakala, director of the film, added: “Let’s say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the reflection of the Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, it was easier for Ian to lick some objects, while some were rather bad.
I’m glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape.”
In a 2015 poll conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent that they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least from time to time.
A disruptive family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
The family left behind £50,000 in damage to a rental house owned by the city after they had been displaced due to neighborhood terrorism.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been fired from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company said shocked that the apartment was in a renovated condition.
There were shooting holes in the walls, floor boards had been ripped off, garbage had been spread on the floors, and the walls had been crushed with graffiti.
The couple are now moving and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the apartment may no longer be rescued.
He says, “This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to tolerate such a thing.
There is a lot to weigh on, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as its name does.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time.The police said the family’s horrors included street fights on baseball squares, intimidation of close relatives, drug use and trafficking, and loud screaming, quarrelling and cursing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received an order on antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, old garbage was found.
The house had previously sold drugs, and floor boards had been ripped off.
Neighbors said the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Office forced the couple out this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the expulsion – they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors said, “They didn’t care about anyone.
We have lived with their neighbors for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times.”
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It’s going to be wonderful now that they’re finally released.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of compulsory practices at the Cornwall Housing Office, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly called.
Old toys and garbage were thrown on the wall.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for his or her own and family’s behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency considers.
This case was very difficult as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to watch for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.”
Fitzpatrick says the family’s three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twenty.
A dirty mattress was found in one of the bedrooms.
Household workers now have to clean up the garbage around the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and other supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after being found guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the tombstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been told to have moved to a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were carved with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding evictions for tenants who violate rental rules.
Angela Crow, a police officer in Devon and Cornwall, said the announcement served as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly challenging the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without accusation, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying aircraft dropped off the beach in Portugal scares tourists
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed.
The air force said it was a training flight that did not pose a security threat.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were scared when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes near-to-touch from tourists taking sunbathing on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood on their feet, understandably concerned about the aircraft’s engines, which began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the photographers of the dramatic flyby and the holidaymakers who posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, “It crossed the beach twice at a really low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing into the ground.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I was sure the plane would crash on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggering low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight intended to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires hampered visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to poor visibility caused by the smoke and fog, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
First quarter results better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) achieved a better result in January – 3.4 million euros in June than planned.
The exo result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has managed to dismantle institutional care.
Treatment was carried out in all areas.
This year, Exote aims to reduce the range of measures.
The exotic excess covers the previously created deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The entire year’s result is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The exotic board will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border doctors swore military oath in Imola
Seventy officers of the Border and Coast Guard School swore their military oath on Friday.
The military ceremony of the gardens of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Helicopter Course was held in the sports field of the garrison.
He was sworn by 70 soldiers.
Specialist border doctors are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They served for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people have applied for special border doctors.
250 of them were selected.
Special border doctors have been trained in Imola since 2007.
At the meeting, five veterans of the border troops during the war were involved.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of a thief ahead - criminal investigation helps in the investigation of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has had a Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA) since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahore and Hämeenlinna.
It is carried out by a colonel in the Bay.
He serves as commander in Lahore.
In addition, the strengths of the unit include a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone is working in the civil sector.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the other police.
This includes, among other things, information about asylum seekers.
The most recent workplace reform
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform in the way police work.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police are increasingly rarely going out and ringing only when they receive an alarm.
With the data collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are directed to where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence center was established in the country, under three national units, and each police institution had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR-Center, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the activities nationwide.
In the PTR units, according to their name, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard Department work.
RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond the territory.
Whereas the individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work shift, the RTA unit’s task is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of the institution itself, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, a database of alert missions and observations, the unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called sequencing, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the behavior, a certain type of image is formed.
The sorting can be done either by act or by person depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public.
Both the methods used by them and the criminals are not, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus striving to prevent the police’s attempts to combat crime.
The police will publicly report the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was from the beginning of the summer, for example, the method of marking empty apartments used in housing robberies.
In it, the perpetrators placed a stick, a knot, or a piece of tape on the outer door of the apartment, with which they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be public at least to the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the district court’s minutes, from which it can be shown, for example, that fingerprints have been found on the spot.
Next time, the thieves will take the gloves in hand.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä Hämeen from the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical actions.
A decrease in the amount of workforce and funding.
The first steps toward a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
Within the framework of national cooperation, information is collected outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl killed in Syria
One of three British schoolchildren, Kadiza Sultana, who joined ISIS last year, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl’s family had heard that Sultana had died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s base in Syria, ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was just planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“We can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a testament so that people understand this is a real risk when going to a war zone – and that will cause people to give up their decision to leave,” Akunjee says.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern London schoolgirls boarded a plane that flew to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married a ISIS fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination for Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose a person to replace late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with fairly high certainty."
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was only speculation and that Reid had not talked directly with Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team’t want to “shake the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination are "supporters" and "self-helpers" of the presidential candidate Donald Trump.
According to him, Trump is not suitable for the job.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men
Treats is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a calendar designed in the 1970s style and inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of celebrity models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chief executive Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from the old school Playboy magazine because he said, “Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
He thinks the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images of the female body without any trouble,” Shaw said in a press release.
“Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
Those wishing to join the calendar can submit their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who will buy records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you get the time to write your angry objection in the comment section under the pseudonym NoneAllLonelyMankind, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the research company YouGov, behind the much-talked revival of vinyl discs is not the boom of the millennial generation, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the background is the nostalgia of the middle age.
The person who recently purchased a vinyl album is most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the age group 18 to 24 are the least likely buyers.
It’s not just the enthusiast’s desire to shave records, it’s emotional: older vinyl disc buyers are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56 percent vs. 53 percent) and enjoy being alone (69 percent vs. 66 percent).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news show, the camera would follow me as I walked along the bustling Soho Street, wearing an untouchable grey shirt.
Let us clarify.
Although Soho is slowly losing its charm and scratch as the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over premises previously owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty dish stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment, as I look very close to the men visiting these shops and try by observing to estimate their age and quality of character.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (currently two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (currently eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London in the afternoon and spends his extra time exploring the range of stores.
I wonder if he is a collector.
“I think I am,” he says.
“I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records.”
These plates fill the walls of her living room, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by email, I didn’t follow her home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his available income.He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they originally appeared, and re-buy things he had to sell when he was young and money-free.
“I get a lot of late 60s and early 70s stuff that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” she says.
She agrees that those who buy vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke or drink very much.
It is my evil.”
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new type of human stream influenced by the media jump. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl records again and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“Based on my conversations, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyls,” he says.
This may explain the boom of certain age vinyl herbs.
What about the alleged emotional significance of sound discs?
In just a few seconds, a movement like Phonica realizes that they provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are worried about the contactless payment system in particular.
The digital world may shock some of the vinyl flavours, for whom returning to familiar record boxes means persistence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
“I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires material assets for some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
“I feel like this as a collector, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere.”
“We’re like social workers!” whispers Wez’s co-worker behind the tape.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not listened to their record.
The poll also that 41 percent have a record player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don’t have their own record player at all.
At this point in the news show, I would probably look like a serious face while browsing the stacked bossa nova collections.
The new appearance of vinyl discs is also associated with a “pocket phenomenon” that has been observed by Jonny, a 42-year-old seller of the Sounds of the Universe store (currently customers of three middle-aged men).
“A customer recently came in and said he doesn’t have a recording player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
"These types of customers are not large, but they do.
Materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a recording player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just beginning a hobby.”
The customer base is much more varied at Fopp, to which I am coming next. The business has devoted a whole layer to vinyl plates.
Guests include seventy-year-old couples, photographers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers delights, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous moves: the speakers are splashing in place of swirling jazz with Wild Beast’s newest sex-blowing synthesizer pop.
None of the clients appear to be lonely, but it’s hard to find out about the psychological trauma of standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes and watched various discounted records.
He is looking at things rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
“They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the subtlety of the vineyard is ...”, he releases a delighted suck and continues:
“I can’t explain, they’re so unique.”
My last stop is the store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a group of teenage girls imagining jumping jeans, but instead gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and daughter considering buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the walls, because they are just an element of the interior and partly so high that they are not even crossed.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that any means of gaining attention to these records could mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there’s little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population that is most likely to have more time and money than most people is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although, based on my research, YouGov’s findings are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the large number of women’s collectors and vinylfans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be tightly tied to school or work.
They won’t spend their Thursday mornings modeling in Berwick Street’s record stores, browsing albums, and avoiding the 30-year-old who plays as a television conductor, staring frighteningly and mirroring the malicious middle-aged men.
The Holker, or Ice Shark, is the longest-lived vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice sheep was between 272 and 512 years.
French court rejects request to dismantle jungle shops
A French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities demanding the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary shops established in the refugee camp. Shops sell to the refugee camp residents a variety of goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. Temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais Prefecture authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
Temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 temporary merchants, but considered the Prefect’s concerns “fully understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp have a much greater significance than just providing food to people who “live in extremely volatile conditions.”
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids, a non-profit cafe that offers 200 meals a day, hours of English and French, and asylum counseling for the camp’s hundreds of unaccompanied minors whose status is most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address requiring a children’s cafe to beined.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure “would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the jungle camp population has risen to a record, more than 9,000 people.
Food prices in Finland are falling faster than the EU average.
Food is falling sharply in Finland to the joy of consumers and to the anger of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has dropped by almost five percent in three years, compared with an average of 0.9 percent in the EU countries.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, food prices in Finland have fallen the second most in those EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
Only in the UK food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data appear from the article by Statistics Center’s development manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published on the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 1990s, food prices increased sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Russia has imposed a ban on food imports, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices in agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Both S-Group and Kesko have lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has dropped considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, VAT significantly affects the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the neighboring countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food in the countries with the same salary level.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we will keep the VAT half the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
This is a standard that is implemented in all Finnish schools.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine writing is abandoned, and instead coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish teaching begins at the latest at sixth grade, and social teaching begins at four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
Previously it was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make school more interesting.
The world’s oldest vertebrate has been discovered, it can live up to 400 years.
Somniosus microcephalus reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150 years.
It could survive another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only surpassed by the Islanders, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland is floating along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to observations only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified two adult ice sharks from 28 females left in fishing gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carbon testing of the glasses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493-cent and 502-cent Amatsonian, were found to be approximately 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity when they are over a square meter old, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann launches 300 employees, sales are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockmann.
The cooperation with the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be carried out in the form of redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers in the warehouses will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of support functions will be offered a new job as vendors.
Stockmann’s OTC negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, the reduction needs were estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of approximately 20 million euros, which are expected to be realized in the coming year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency program that aims to savings of €50 million this year.
The backdrop is Stockmann’s difficulties in making goods-house trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted revenue improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the commodity-house trade is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO of Stockmann, sales in warehouses have not reached the company’s targets.
“Unfortunately, personnel cuts are necessary in order to ensure a positive business result for Stockmann Retail in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter’s revenue improvement was driven by the good success of Lindex.
The chain achieved the best turnover and results of the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
At the same time last year, Stockmann Group’s total operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the most rainy in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius across the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rains in the central part of the country, but there will be drizzle in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the northern regions rainfall remains at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's sports team is shaken by a doping scandal - strange explanation for the coach's capture
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of Kenya's national team, said Anzrahi's identity was revealed after he had given a surprising sample of Rotichin.
Doping officials went to report to the Anzrahi authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," Kenyan Olympic Committee Chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics start on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favorite winners.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the village.
When anti-doping officials encountered him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of revealing himself," the source said.
Where are they all?
The Rio Stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
In Rio, the fight for medals began on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio’s organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of tickets for the first morning games and 65 percent of tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was blown up by a crowd.
Tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have already attracted attention.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the auditoriums for rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duel, the Netherlands played against Russia, with about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators filled.
The bad progress is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first game of the Brazilian football team did not pull the stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, a significantly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
Ticket prices in Rio have ranged from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats at the London Olympics, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty spaces in Rio this morning.
Even the beach balloon on the sand of Copacaba has not interested the public.
He competed in London in 2012.
People in the newspaper were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The foundation, which was established last year, will acquire ecologically significant natural areas.
Subsequently, individuals, companies and entities can redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks, which those who wish can acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The owner receives a veto right on its 187 square square blocks, which means that no approval from each holder is required if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holding rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go and carry banners or tie yourself somewhere to protect nature,” justifies Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to own his company.
The owner receives accurate location information from his block, which allows for example a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of those who acquired ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the land area data can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a public utility foundation with the purpose of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation will act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the fund is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to go beyond Finland’s borders and plans to procure land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Center on August 13-19.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku worst of the big cities - look at the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves are the most affected cities in Finland.
More bicycles were stolen this year than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle theft to the police, the Helsinki Sanomat investigated the amount of bicycles and their parts stolen per 1,000 inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Esbo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were to the police.
That is a big difference.
“In other cities, there are twice as many robberies as in other cities in proportion to the number of inhabitants,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Government.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It is very difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in the Marketplace than elsewhere.
I have no answer to it.
“The frequency of theft can be influenced by how much people move on wheels in the city and how many wheels there are at all,” says Lieutenant Lieutenant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the police government believes that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are expected to rise to the top in the comparison.
The numbers of bicycle thefts vary greatly depending on the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“Esbo, for example, is a different type of city, where the city centers are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transportation,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, the police are aware of slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the same period of last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and about 4,000 bicycles a year in Helsinki alone.
“These are huge amounts,” Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take even more bikes, as only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a criminal report on bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases to the police survive.
A typical investigated bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught with his blood.
"Cases will also be cleared in the context of other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly for the crime itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen from shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
Of the individual bicycle models, the most are stolen in Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term use, for example, but a large proportion of the stolen bicycles end up being sold, for example, via the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that the stolen bicycles would go abroad,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, as he may commit a crime of concealment or violation.
“Alarm bells should sound if a well-contained bike is sold at a clear discount,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library officer, always carries his colorful Nopsa during his working day to the shelter of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, Hirvi tells him, "I have never been taken away, I have been a good monk."
"Per this is not so attractive to thieves, there is not necessarily a hysterical value here," Hirvi of Helsinki thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quick at a kiosk in Helsinki’s Kallio, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel has struck the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his wheel in something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“I always hear from my friends that the wheel has been taken away.”
“Mostly bad bikes, such crap bikes.”
A motorcycle was stolen from his home a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve could wait for it to be seized.
Children under the age of 15 are liable for their crimes.
Helsinki is testing peer-to-peer teams from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury team is being tested to prevent young people from falling into the criminal circle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to persons under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The first crime committed by a young man is missing.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss the crime with the perpetrator and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer jury to compensate for his offence.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
There are other methods that are used in parallel.
“Everything is directed in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at the service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was a mistreatment that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on your chosen path,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is backed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new approaches are offered to all in need, not just to immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was by the American newspaper Politico, which had received it to see the draft.
The letter was addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to go to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, along with his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking disappointment, threaten to bring the Democrats to the vote in these elections,” the letter said.
Just directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections could prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor in their neck.
The letter says the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently Trump-anti-Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter came from "people who want the party to protect their majorities in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for American children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I aim to be president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is aspiring to be president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the wealthy, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American duuners who suffer from factory shifts to countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called it the largest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We have to build, we have to build.
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working children.
Sanders said on Thursday that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax evasion, it will have to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I oppose any trade agreement that acts against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations released by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favoring only this type of millionaires."
Clinton has previously called Trump’s proposed reduction of corporate taxes a “trump hole.”
Clinton said on Thursday she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded audiences about small whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and about clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are the spectators numbers in Rio: the tournaments have not glued the Finns to the boxes, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports glasses appear in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of viewers.
At one time, 12% of the population adhered to the screen at their best: 615,000 viewers watched YLE’s Olympic channel TV2 swimming on Tuesday night at the same time.
For comparison: a month ago, the European Championship in general sports attracted 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, while the European Championship in football attracted just over two million.
The Olympic sports have so far been most interested in Sunday night cycling and rack gymnastics, which opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time almost half a million spectators.
Panu Pokkinen, head of Yle Sports, is pleased with the number of spectators, and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments.
In addition to watching the Olympics on television, Finns will also watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions to own an entire canal.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that is a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of the Rio Games broadcasts are in Finland at night time.
Another reason for the lack of interest – if someone thinks it is a dilution now – is a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone’s surprise medal from the first tournament, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are just beginning, as are other species of interest for Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When the show starts, the spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which rose in the first days of the competition to be the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I’d bet we’re already going to get 200,000 downloads.
“We’ll only get the audience numbers later,” Pokkinen said.
Rio Arena has not worked with all users as hoped.
Pochkin says the feedback has arrived and the errors have been corrected.
The launch of the Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the initial phase.
There are updated versions of the applications that should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen on the YLE channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Puhe broadcasts competitions on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only the hardest ever, but also the last to be watched only on the YLE channels.
Starting in 2018, the Olympic Games will be broadcast on both YLE and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Ristinsel.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving trainer, discovered at Ristisel a gravity of about 20 square meters, the depth of which the diving computer showed was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by using noise screening.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 meters are Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as thoroughly as the Trends.
In particular, the bottom of the Inari lake has not been accurately mapped.
“There could be unknown deep roads,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Looking at this way, your Days will not get into the top ten, and your Suge Water is even further from the top.
Repair on August 12 at 14:29: Corrected the last piece, where the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong.
The tax rate for pensioners continues to be tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than the taxation of wage-takers.
Ihalainen says that the misconduct came to light during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the salaries.
This is not included in the government’s proposal.
We think that should definitely be so.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received reductions in their income, which eased their taxes.
The case was heated in parliament by representatives of the opposition, who defamed the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (collectively) on his election promises.
Buying power does not grow.
According to Ihalainen, in the line-up presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (collective) on tax cuts, it is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be raised.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (center) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with hard work.
He says keeping up with the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government.
It is done by the forces of the labour market organisations, so it should not be stumbled upon by questioning.
It comes to necessity because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
prolonged unemployment
Mr. Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least in order to stop its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fade.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Embassy: There are no casualties in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be careful and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand do not have a reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few people in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the end of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish citizens in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has sought to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes the events may be linked to the political unrest in a divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among others, people were arrested who said they opposed the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand there is, in turn, an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thailand Police: Attacks are not international terrorism
The police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differed from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also ruled out, according to the Thai news agency AP.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including at tourist attractions in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded on the holiday island of Phuket in the middle of the night, according to the Bangkok Post.
According to current data, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngata, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs exploded in the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin yesterday and today.
Both bombings killed at least one person.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both the towns of Surat Than and Trang in southern Thailand.
In both attacks at least one person was killed.
Surat Thani is also well-known to many tourists, as it is transported to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The attacker is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t get people to panic anymore, he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all of the attacks occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be careful and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand do not have a reason to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the ambassador's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
Last week’s attack on Hua Hin was.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens.
The attack on Hua Hin injured at least three people.
Two bombs exploded near the clock tower.
Thai PBS that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin, where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the provincial governor, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bench.
An employee of the municipality was killed.
There are at least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarterfinals
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still seeking to win the championships in the Rio Games with permando, jumping and booming.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics to a considerable extent in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the championship three times in a row, and the boom last year and last year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world team championships.
Lower MM medals in Biles have jumping and booming.
Finnish entrepreneur: "The storm has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think anything more miraculous will follow from this, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about a couple of decades.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen from close many tragedies that have suffered Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If they didn’t drive out tourists, they probably didn’t.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the scene of the explosion.
He heard the attack from his own officer.
The employee called around nine a.m. local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila said both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought it was for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half three o’clock in the day, the traffic in Patong was normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the scene, the explosion was relatively small, Huovila, who visited the scene, said.
Later that car was seen in Crounupy on the Jouxholminti road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for the signs hiding in a nearby seat.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other man fled, but was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and serious injury.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Leadership Change in Russia: Clear Displacement
Russia's highest-ranking executive shift in years took place on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin removed his head of government, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is the 44-year-old Estonian Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s resignation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into quarrels with other senior executives or has been messed up.
Destruction of Ivanov
Ivanov, one of Putin’s inner circles, will be transferred to special roles in environmental and transport affairs.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested to be transferred to other positions and suggested the Persecution to replace him, Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s perspective, this is a clear downturn.
Environmental and transport issues are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the top of Russian power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev took over as president.
Kangaspuro points out that old cards, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that what is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s post is that Putin changes his neighbors to younger ones.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars in which they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the Islamic State’s city of Manbij.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We previously mistakenly that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs publication of documents is illegal.
The Interior Ministry’s policy on the publicity of documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
Earlier, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the participant list of the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council Chancellor and with the fact that the information was recorded in the calendar of the Minister and not in the accounting material.
The Communications Director of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic performance begins in Rio de Janeiro
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time.
He broke his back in the beginning of the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in a much better shape.
I’ve practiced well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a news conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed sambata dancers and fans-converted journalists.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when sports have struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt’s last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he scored the first 200 meters at the time of 21,05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, with which he broke the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors in spite of the final celebration in a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career by measuring the clock.
The world records of 9,58 in a hundred meters and 19,19 in a two hundred are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is striving for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second undercut, but no one but Bolt himself believes in it.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, who won the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
In the final of the World Cup in Beijing last year, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his tenure in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the World Cup finals.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the young men's race, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt’s final goal line will be next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I’m older and it’s harder.
But whenever I’m underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping abuse
Chinese state news agency Xinhua that 18-year-old Chen Xinyi gave a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chen Xiny's doping sample contains traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
In Rio, she finished fourth in the women’s 100 meters butterfly race.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese champion has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said a sample given by Xiny on Sunday found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Additional doping allegations have been revealed.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has banned a sports coach from Rio de Janeiro for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, the victim is Kenyan fast-trainer John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich’s pass.
Phelps are not stopped by anything - historic gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the American Michael Phelps, swam in the 200 meters mixed with his 22nd Olympic victory.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic medals.
Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in four consecutive competitions.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in the mixed match ahead of Chinese Wang Shuni.
I just try to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
Helen Skelton’s story on Monday is one of the most read stories on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get much stress if there’s a little noise in the Finnish or British press about his revealing and peculiar dresses.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is wearing high-heels shoes and a short-heels dress that is sure to have at least enough revelation – at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, reversal is not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small scales are just fun.
Skelton wants to tone and even get upset, but he emphasizes that he doesn’t want to be in the main role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We are watching sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that it has reached Finland?
I can’t, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me.
Do you know what?
It's a whisper from scratch if it comes from dressing (the leader).
I’m so excited if someone has hit me like that.
Rio police arrest two people on terror suspicion
Rio police said on Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police arrested them in the course of the contest.
Police also arrested five others and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the Islamic State group.
The suspects allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were spread, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
There are 85,000 police officers in Rio.
Police explode suspicious package in Rio de Janeiro
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio Basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in a basketball arena and locked it from the public.
The police let the public in after controlledly detonating the package.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled explosion.
Police closed the area due to a suspicious package.

Argentine lady kicks Petäjä-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
It was a colorful competition in Rio.
The wind was heavy on Thursday.
An Argentine lady dressed the Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He was stuck because of the crash, and the others fled, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete long thought about protesting.
It was not necessary to do so because it would have been ineffective according to the Olympic Rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get compensation, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hanged on his board until the end because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finnish team left in 27th place.
In total, the 2012 Olympic Olympics in London are eighth.
At the top, it did not have much impact.
Friday is an important day for the 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 things that, according to science, prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to add additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring them additional years.
These include a tendency to average obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don’t have to worry about it, just picking a milk bottle is enough.
The secret of longevity has been investigated through various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange findings.
According to science, all of these things can add more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been found to protect some against cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A study from Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death”, especially in the case of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption of one to three daily doses of alcohol may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of a toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found how laughter affects a person’s lifetime.
The seven-year project was followed by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
It can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
There are years of excellence, that is not to be denied.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute complacency.
In fact, a study from the University of Oxford found that women with a large back had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega-3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bulldozer.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person’s social status – which in turn makes it possible to pursue recognition such as a Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behavior of people over the age of 65 found that people who shop every day were less likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can lead to premature death.
So drop your credit card from your hand – therefore, online shopping will not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashed into truck
On Friday night, there was a serious collision between a truck and a passenger car.
The accident occurred in Koskela, between Koskentie and Sorvastonti on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forsa, when the passenger car that came in the face had crashed into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stood up on the runway, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car crashed over the roof and then over the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 was caught in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the University Central Hospital in Turku for treatment.
The result of the woman’s blow test was 2.02 promiles.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
I sent the mail to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket’s loose cargo range had flaws because the post had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose bags at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product flaws in the bulk, because the Post delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when the mail gets delivered!
If you don’t go into the barrel, you read it on the label.
The dealer’s foxing sign is linked to the fact that Posti last spring expanded its services to include grass-cutting.
The grass cut is on the supply of the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with amazement.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that this matter has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonderes.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourites caught in a loose bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is in charge of the business of Post's Enterprise Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The backdrop is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia was not upset by the label, because she found all her own lookout favorites in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 pounds, posted a photo of her change.
The comedian has gained tens of kilos since the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of a life change.

Comedian and television producer Lotta Backlund began her weight loss career in 2009.
She has a comprehensive lifestyle change and lost weight slowly by thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a photo of his outstanding performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how enormously Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The Backlund Before and After photo pair has gathered a number of appreciative comments from fellow exchangers.
You are awesome.
At the same time we are on the road, motivation is strong! one shakes.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get tremendous strength and enthusiasm from your photographs when I am on the same road, another tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds with the Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehd that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was about ten kilograms.
Within three months of exercise, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Lovisa: Victim memories for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for police dog work.
Sibbo Veterinary Station has released an update on Facebook, where it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations to the police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Siboo Veterinary Station and also completed his nurse training there.
The veterinarian station reminds the woman with touching words.
He is happy, intelligent, humorous and not afraid of work.
The good friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The donation money will be allocated to the police dog, primarily to the purchase of seat belts.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman in Lovisa was murdered in her own yard in Lovisa’s Koskenkylä.
Neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a cock.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no contact with each other.
In the pursuit of the murderer was involved the police dog Börje, who was injured in the detention situation life-threateningly.
But he survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced the Post for violation of the Equality Law
The Post had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform a tenant, the Kanta-Hämeen district court assessed in its judgment.
The district court ordered the Post to pay the employee the majority of the salary held and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post could have withheld from the remuneration of the instructor only the part that corresponded to the part of the instructor’s work of the whole day.
According to the district court, the employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Post and Logistics Industry Union of the PAU on the prohibition of informing.
In November last year, the PAU made a decision that Post employees would not inform hired workers who violated the strike.
This was first by People's News.
Turkey to return to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist’s Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier, the Union of Journalists asked Sipil and Soin to express concerns about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of press and freedom of expression.
Putin removes head of government to replace Estonian leader
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He is replaced by Karl Vaino’s grandson Anton Vaino.
Perseo is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
He is also a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his leader.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s inner circle, will be transferred to special roles in environmental and transport affairs.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested transfer to other positions and proposed the Persecution to replace him, Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the Soviet Union for the KGB.
In 2008, Ivanov was considered a possible successor to Putin, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU’s giant acquisition to play ban – not to be seen at Premier League opening
The world record transfer player will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League starts this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is out of play due to a ban when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus for 105 million euros.
However, the Football Federation of England (FA) has banned him from playing because Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a one-match ban.
The ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, great madness is a virtue
The precise criteria for well-being and ambitious visions have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event celebrated by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylized, among other things, with artworks and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only the main lava and the tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small quarter festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The underlying question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It’s quite unusual for producers to think like this.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with authority regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be out of sale this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 by 70,000 last year.
This year, there will be a lot of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle driven by huge tracks.
We do not want that.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the area, which is partially devastated by artificial violence.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year there will be a tent for 15,000 people.
He admitted that the process could be made even simpler.
Per I’m a little mad, but at the same time we’ve managed to keep the Flow’s spirit.
If we lose it, it is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even big visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event, in the middle of the 21st century, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of approximately 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the stock company that operates Flow was approximately 6 million euros.
It can be used to create “circular things” such as building that 73 meter wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive clothes.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost in terms of content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s world of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists on the stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge crowd of fans in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was kicked off because this is likely to be the last time she is seen on a show in Finland.
We are interested in history and the future.
Not just what is being played on commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album is fucking good and she has done fucking good performances in the last few years.
Bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in baskets - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 wounded.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a floral basket and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia, tweeted about the attacks.
If the tweet does not appear properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
People ran toward me and said the bomb had exploded near the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack occurred in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet exploded.
Thai authorities say there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings, which are dissatisfied with the military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to the Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized the activities of criminal groups engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, warriors are ordered to engage in combat tasks only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, head of training for the Defence Forces, for example, of the guardsmen who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation are only those who are in the final stage of their training.
According to the head of training, reserve personnel belonging to the readiness forces will be assigned to service first.
No warrior or reservist is ordered for a task that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will start training warriors for immediate readiness units from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during warrior training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation for hometown
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey separate house had been 330 000 euros.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple went to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and court.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s trial and settlement costs in the amount of €47,344.
The court justified the price reduction slightly, because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when making the housing sale.
However, according to the court, the construction errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been proposed.
Looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a well-contained home because they did not want to start repairs.
He had the notion that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there is no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and inappropriate ventilation and the fact that the control of rain and melting waters flowing along the rocky surface is insufficient.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma believed that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little in a few years.
The sale took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were far more serious than thought.
In 2012 and 2013, inspections in the building found a microbial growth, which witnesses said was due both to the rock’s rainwater and capillary moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector’s estimate, also enter the interior through the window.
Mould or yeast, which posed a health risk and exceeded the limit values, was found in sheet samples in the home care room, the staircase in the basement, the window mark of the living room and the basement washing room.
Buildings without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware before the transaction of the decision of the city of Espoo, according to which the apartment had been subjected to changes contrary to the authorisation.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although the appropriate permits had not yet been obtained.
Homosexuality was a major issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large-scale repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma did not have any special reason to conduct a wider inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to take the order, the court said in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis, including Finns
In a recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland has microfilmed documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women sought to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are from the racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The racial office was operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true in even greater proportions for women who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological examinations to clarify the matter.
The Racial Bureau investigated the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from relatives.
The Race Office wanted guarantees that women were “child-loving”, “sparing” and “good national socialists” who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men’s brides.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The Honour of a German Mother was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Arians" and "non-Arians" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
In the sixth round, he rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympics, but was the tail jump of the whole group on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose in overall position eighth after five departure, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day departure for 17th and 3rd places.
Overall, Sirene is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgren are in 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna recorded a couple of hours of night’s sleep: “I was so stuck”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who became the tango king of the cruise ship in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance bands and festivals, is still on the lookout.
Mari Koppinen's book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, which tells the life of the favorite singer, was published today Thursday.
The book tells about his life and career, in good and in bad.
Sillanpään’s career rose to a total rise when he won the tango king’s crown at Seinäjoen Tangomarket in 1995.
In the contest, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Sillanpäi, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible bump and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so choked!
The bridge is in the book.
From the recording of a huge hit song, you would not immediately guess that it was sung in a crap.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I’ve learned that you don’t have to constantly demand perfection and perfection.
The second coincidence associated with the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then partner and the case eventually ended in the lyrics of the song You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
In the book it is stated that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the song telling the divorce were not true, it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 Days magazine.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for Jari’s divorce from his ex-lover was Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but according to Jari, it was a whole joke and it wasn’t true.
According to the book, Jari played in anger at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British voted to leave the European Union.
In the end, 52 percent of the voters voted in favour of the separation and 48 percent would have remained in the Union, even though polls forecast the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the distinction, even though a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The motto of former US President Bill Clinton’s campaign “It’s the economy, stupid” has been used in the UK’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn’t seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics finds the answers to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand economics.
Many still have the notion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it’s out of the right British.
Many also have the notion that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economic Committee, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were especially stunned by the BBC’s impartiality, which gave just as much space to the economists who represented only a few percent of the economy, and to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hateful press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economics combinations thought of the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were not cared for, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics in big cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant crowds your hospital, the immigrant exploits you.
These arguments have stumbled.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
There are immigrants in the waiting rooms of every health center.
How much easier would the British get medical hours if they didn’t have them?
In every school there are immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were removed?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the indigenous people have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to answer them, and even if they succeeded, their answers were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are the net payers of the UK’s public budgets and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen had prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the league in favour of the EU, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they may be needed.
We started raising cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily listed real estate fund covered by the news.
The average rate is 15-20 percent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The company’s assets are worth approximately £20 billion.
That was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10 percent or even below it.
Real Estate funds are preparing for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed trade.
When the disengagement camp of the European Union won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate traders.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared to the years 2007 and 2008, Oldhanen said.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors remained nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and one after another the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price downward.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth taking the money out in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you are not forced to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority canceled the notification.
Since then it has been quite stable, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Oldhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen’s Continental European funds.
There were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
The closure of real estate funds trading has received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the shutdowns control about four percent of Britain’s real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties in 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could keep its funds closed until the end of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slashed downward, but the situation doesn’t seem “better” for Aberdeen.
The major questions now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and the dollar are at their lowest rate in 30 years, and the market has seen a 15% discount in sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of people who want to buy, he said.
Brexit brings down on London’s property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation did not seem so strange.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investments at British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the outcome of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The force was there.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning night.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, produced the news, and the usually loud crowd completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stood in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display ends blinked red.
It was such a morning that I never thought I would have lived, said the old man.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somehow peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit voting starts the reform movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to change.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and especially in the London property market.
Offices in London were expected to drop by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the poison has disappeared, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still too early to say what will happen after Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Early data on the London real estate market has already been obtained.
Property services company CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
Prices for all London properties fell 3.3% from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 percent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months ago there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the U.S. real estate market.
The comparison is not quite appropriate, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has now seen no panic sales like those of the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Financing is normal.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him – it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have climbed up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, as has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to seek profits from new items.
On top of this, loans have been easily available – although the debt gap has now been used, according to Vanhanen, clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralized and Decentralized
In London, prices increased in the past summer, Oldhanen says.
Aberdeen also started lightening its ownership in London and was a net seller last year.
I expected a turn, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Oldhanen says.
He does not dare to say much about the future, but says there is hardly any promise of a rise.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a downward or flat course ahead.
Vanhanen has seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the hole can be overcome by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Vanhanen.
The S-Group begins to register purchase data more accurately than before
Soon, the S-Group will know what you eat, as the retail group said today that it will begin to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the information has been collected to date on the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received on the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have prohibited the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into 10 groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Standard customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from the K-Group own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planning to do so at this time.
Finland’s Nearby Market has its own First Bonus client program, to which you can join at Selintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkete.
We do not currently collect information on the product or product group level, we will stay at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day, as well as the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K group or the S group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, it is planned to reform the loyalty program in the future, but Lähkauppa will tell later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s client owner and client register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence, as well as children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The purchase date and time of the purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchases and the method of payment are stored from the S-Premium Card purchase.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is recorded at the product group level so far.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owners and Partnerships at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored in the box, whether you want it or not.
Anyone who wishes can check their deposited data on the S-Group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to data, insists Saarikoski.
Video: Heila is the newest dog reinforcement by Tull - the puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador’s puppy snails five similar boxes in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box, next to which Heila was sitting, a bottle of stinking shells was revealed.
The straw gas is the first smell that has now been trained with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
The security situation and the main reasons for online trading
Heila is Tull’s first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may also be carried out to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main workplace for Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in the Customs and after the attacks the control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, chief inspector of the Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for the duties of the Customs are the postal shipments that pass through Helsinki-Vanda.
As the internet trade grows, up to 40 million mail sends pass through the airport each year, including arms and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, the Customs Department of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport has made about 300 discoveries of online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work across the Helsinki-Vantage.
It will examine recorded luggage and postal shipments.
For ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, the Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to the idea.
School in Church
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio is also training with Heila as a police and Defence Forces expert.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Force has expertise in explosives.
The Customs will decide, together with other authorities, which smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila will always be further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantage are Tull’s six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Heila Labrador was chosen out of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to be picked up for the airport include agility and hunting abilities, as well as calmness as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There is no way to go home without the heels, Suntio laughs.
Excellent orders are given to the heels.
The Ilta-Sanomien cameraman loses the microphone cover of the camera to a fast dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy immediately with the "rit" command.
Strong competition for dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heilan can be seen in work tasks in Helsinki-Vantage next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, the passengers can’t come and lick a dog wearing a work jacket, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is approximately €60,000 to €70,000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a tough competition for dog owners.
The company has approximately 20 to 30 employees.
Luckily, Suntie has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory tasks at the Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - the nation gets a holiday
With fewer than a million inhabitants, Fiji’s rugby Olympic gold is so highly valued in the country that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed this after the championship was settled.
A free day will be held the next day of the team’s return home.
Heroes are also celebrated in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final was followed in the country’s capital, Suva, where a screen was erected on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants watching the game, I heard them encourage, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter drowned after a fierce performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 kilograms.
Tokol has a special and life-threatening characteristic.
During heavy lifts or immediately after them, he has repeatedly fainted.
No one really knew why.
Tokola received a push of 175 kilograms in Rio and 145 kilograms in a catch.
His combined weight was 320 kilos.
At the end of the day, Tokola tried to gain 175 kilograms, as in the second.
At the third attempt, the weights rose by a loud scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish elevator was delighted that he suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with over ten player agents.
Slowly from the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flor in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemen will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goalkeeper Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Modern Family star: Teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who starred in the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again shocked by presenting her threatening body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that do not leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actress's legs, but also his back.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be much more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very narrow clothes.
Winter, who is on the brink of adulthood, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television almost all her life and grew up in the era of the Kardashians.
He’s learned that the more he looks out on the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the series Modern Family when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of his long-standing fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downturn is already so strong, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge not to care about criticism.
You look great!
Same as what others say.
You’re an inspiration for many women, shines a young woman.
Japanese prefer to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by a rainbow: in autumn it is possible to see a fabulous mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start rainbow trips in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main tourist destinations in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Revontulet are the main cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart-winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter skiing in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales for autumn trips.
Few people know that the season begins early in the autumn and continues until the long spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the rainbow lights, making the sight twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, Head of Marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland’s main target group are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would want clearer and unique sights from Finland, and there is a tremendous potential, according to Lind.
The number of Japanese tourists staying overnight in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent overnight in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are an interesting target group in terms of Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's championship team won gold
Britain’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby competition was crushed when Fidzi defeated it in the final at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday with numbers 43–7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, moves, side treats, support games, running lines and brutality in force and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat meant silver, which was a slightly larger consolation for Britain, as it was the country’s third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the rugby-7 tournament for the first time, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strict 7–5 victory over South African Boxers in the semi-finals earlier on the same day could have a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have defeated the British, even if the 15-man team had been in full power.
Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will be awarded a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former Wimbledon-born English rugby 7 coach.
This has been a great experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament to coach Ryan.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss hurts, but the progress is staggering.
Fidzi started out excellently and presented his tackling skills to the UK as for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had crashed into a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions climbed 5–0 as Osea Kolinisau crashed into the corner.
When it was four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal shot.
The score was 12-0 and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent tackling prevented rational Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow down Fiji’s progress for a long time.
After the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right angle, after which Britain was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa scored a second goal in the continuing opening, with the first half of the game remaining for more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the more impotent tackles of the British team and crashed over the goal line.
The opening period ended with a score of 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of a pupil.
Which is largely true.
Britain made large-scale changes in the halftime and managed to hold the Fijians for a whole four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down to a position of 36–7 by scoring for Britain in the left corner, but the game had long been lost to the Antarctic archipelago, whose fans in the auditorium sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fitzgerald.
Mata Viliame made the final order for the Fidži cake by painting in the last moments.
The pile sounded, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell on the pitch, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by a score of 20–5 and Britain had overtaken South Africa in a tight semi-finals, where the draw was decided by the goal of Britain.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxing team in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his blinking footwork and crashed under the pitch in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of English 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and eventually won the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win gold
There could be no more excitement in this game.
From the first to the last bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning scored 220 winning bets into history and found additional purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were two in the air, the third was the voice of coach Robin Williams on the boat, which encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in British sports history to a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was for them already the 39th consecutive and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface of the water like a dwarf of age, does not fully match the nature of success.
There are a lot of helping hands behind each match, each of which has contributed to two achievements.The most important assistant, however, is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
“I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be cut off.
Without it, it would have spread everywhere.
The situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little way of thinking.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that Williams was able to start their treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if now in such circumstances can even be said.
"I needed money, so I had to recover quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
This is where it begins.
It’s a journey in itself, but that made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the win, the two’s thoughts were on Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more than normal trying to overcome his own agitation.
Stanning, the captain of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who was behind the Afghanistan tour, says: “On an emotional level, I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin’s cash have been fantastic.
Without him, we’t be anything, so thank him very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I could not have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to draw.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra power.
“We were very busy in a moment.
Helen Hock: Stay With, Stay With
It’s very important not to get off the road.”
“We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything miraculous.
We didn’t aim for heaven today, we just wanted to do a good match and win the race, which we did.”
They think a year before deciding on their future.
Glover celebrates her wedding next month with Steve Backshall from TV shows.
He just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.”
"It took me about six months after London before I realized I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to replace government in Panama
Iceland is scheduled to hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are being demanded by protesters in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians used tax havens to evade taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Elections are held on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last year will affect the outcome of autumn elections.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of the rulers was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama, the founder of the Islamic State group and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, was involved in creating the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speech and asked for an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander-in-chief of the army who can sink down there," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-favoured covered burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
In a decree signed by Mayor David Lisnard, it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not wear a bathing suit that respects good habits and secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits that greatly express religious connections may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region crossed the seashore - in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the swimming pool of Pyykösjärvi has been observed blue-leaf fatigue.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Environmental Measures of the Oulu Region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentrations of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in the bathing waters of all beaches, with the exception of the seaside beach, were below the measure limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the measure limit.
The blue-leaf decay observed on Pyykösjärvi’s beach does not make the water unable to swim yet, but in favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-leaf bloom, in which case blue-green leaf mass is formed on the water surface as rails.
The Environmental Action is monitoring the situation with intensified checks.
If the blue-leaf flower turns into a blue-leaf flower, this will also be separately on the bathing beach notice board.
Check out the bathing water tests here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 percent of forest owners are outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Finance Ministry’s next year’s budget proposal.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation shift of forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest and to increase the supply of wood.
The purpose of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the net capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation shift in forestry farms is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, there is some criticism about the tax change.
The deduction of forest gifts is proposed to be made from the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is the capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of the wood.
With the deduction of net capital income from forestry, it is prevented that on the basis of the deduction there will be a loss of capital income from forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to describe it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model affects only a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit of the tax deduction bound to the forest’s return value is 40,000 euros.
It seems to be drawn too high.
As such, it will cut 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of forest owners, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the boundary guarantees the goal of growing the size of the farm.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been cutting down for decades.
This is due to the ageing of forestry.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful rainbow surprised drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into a pit and collided
There was a strange catastrophe in the sea on Friday morning.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive cars crashed into the pit, after which the backman crashed into the front driver.
According to firefighter Harri Pyyhtya, the fall into the pit is suspected to have been due to a strong rainbow.
There were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers towards Kalajoe.
A Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers at the University of Turku can help develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of Academy professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of drug therapies against cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, as well as on cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
The murder of Mohos' family home continues in court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The trial continues in the court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family homicide in Muhos.
He was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder and robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The convict was also convicted of serious risk to road safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the deputies and the man who received a tougher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that the man who received a milder sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
At the time they were fully understood.
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths murdered a man who worked as a director of the children’s protection unit at a schoolhouse in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the driver sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had escaped and led the young man into his room, when one of the young men struck him with a vacuum cleaner.
The director was also beaten, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the investigation, both convicts were fully aware at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young men had planned to escape from the family home at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, reproducing only at the age of 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The longevity of a glacier is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimetre per year.
Only one species of mushrooms is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists determined age by radio-carbon testing.
As a result of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the shark.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years old, but it could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Up to one-third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s corporate tax change was implemented.
Tax revenue would also decrease with tax relief, especially for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
Without it, there would be an enormous sum, $1 trillion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely eliminated.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and driving small into bankruptcy.
Environmental standards must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama’s healthcare reform has to be revised.
The government should be appointed by “experts instead of bureaucrats.”
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the major causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements should be discontinued.
Imports from China will be subject to a 45% and Mexico 35% tax.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our belief,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will monitor the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers across the country.
Contrary to his custom, Trump read a speech written by his assistants faithfully, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists—including those close to Republicans—see Trump’s program driving the United States into a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday.
History of the Past - People's News
The sea turns deadly, but the actual wave hits in the middle of Madrid's streets - the accounting with the past can begin.
This is the story of Pedro Almodóvar.
Almodovar’s previous film, Traveler’s Lovers (2013), was a small-scale and rude satirical comedy, preceding the culmination of his career in Spanish touring in The Skin Where I Live (2011).
In fact, Julieta (2016) is situated somewhere between these two works.
It is a quiet, peaceful love, relationship and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart.
The story is simple and we see it as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be the model for a middle-aged man (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be surprised until the end of the movie.
In the form of a backward and long letter, Julieta tells the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter’s birth, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between the Seams (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cuddle, but I would say, quite literally and with a twist.
Almodóvar films often have such a characteristic sense of humor as Juliet has a fair distance.
It is an equally acting, restrained, place by place containing good music and a rather sad movie, which as such has ingredients for elegance.
Instead, the visual color saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is preserved and so that it begins to squeeze in the eye a little bit quietly, more as a pure form than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film suffer from illnesses, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true of costume: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true of the appealing ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the attitudes of the scene in question, are not improved.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is outward and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script based on three novels by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in The Wreck: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-cut literary filmatisation.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably thriving even in a more dramatic drama, with so many big things - especially the flattering guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premieres at 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in robberies.
There will be no new cuts.
The billions already saved are enough.
This is stated by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (collective) during the budget debate.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, as cuts to social security were already decided in the spring framework debate.
Children’s allowance, people’s pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the people’s pension index will be cut by 0.85 percent.
The length of unemployment coverage will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The education cuts continue.
The Ghosts
Why do ministers emphasize that there are no new cuts?
Next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter of the parliamentary period, not gallups.
It has been seen before that the results of municipal elections that lead the government parties in different directions will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup reports, however, that the ruling party is expecting a major defeat, despite its modest 12.3% result in the previous elections compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new delegates, for many of whom the price of influencing the right-wing government will be realised next spring.
The life rope of the government of three roughly equal-sized parties depends on the longevity of the Basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party voters got enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of “no new cuts will come”, first, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out harshly and, second, attempts to soften the blow awaiting the Orthodox Finns.
Cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will likely be different – if the Sipilö government is still standing.
The Government has set the goal of reducing debt over this term, but in the Petteri Orpo budget proposal the debt will be taken next year at 5.9 billion euros, or more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: debt-raising is neither slower nor slower.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means new, even harsher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be shaken at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring we will take what is coming in parliamentary elections.
These actions do not result in debt
It is quite clear that debt-growing is not possible with current actions, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to spark a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the budget awareness session prove this inadvertently:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overstated, meaning there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has hardly risen since the collapse of 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% over this decade and has extended from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
According to the curve presented by Hetemäe, the debt of public communities, which exceeded the 60 percent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 percent by the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Union’s debt relief proposal was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost ofining unemployment will be approximately 6 billion euros, which will be covered entirely by taking new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the collective and the primitive Finns of what is responsible.
A lot of tasks are left to the municipalities.
Three out of four consider that the organization of daycare, youth work and physical activity for children belongs to the responsibility of the municipality, according to the KAKS - Foundation for the development of the municipality.
A clear majority of the people roll the responsibility to the individual municipality also for libraries, culture, citizens’ institutes, construction supervision, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the countryside, in turn, is most clearly sought for landscape planning, specialized medical care, vocational education, vocational sciences schools and institutional care for people with developmental disabilities.
None of the municipal responsibilities are transferred to the state.
Drunk driver runs after police run away
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuula escaped a police guard in Joensuula on Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half one.
A police guard tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran out to drive the police away at a fairly high speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanranti, from which it continued to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran to catch the runner.
The driver’s blow test showed 0.75 promiles.
He also did not have a driving license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in the stone collapsed.
A truck that was in stone glass crashed into a pit in Polvijärvi on the Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15.
The truck had driven to the left in a curved curve out of the road and crashed into a river.
The rescue agency lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above the truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and primary care workers.
The lifting of the vehicle was the responsibility of the owner.
From the crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil into the road which the rescue facility absorbed into turf.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An old woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä in the South Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, thin, with white hair stretching underneath her jaw.
For observations and clues about the missing person's movements, please call the emergency center of the Pohjanmaa on the suggestion number 0295440513.
The elements of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the disasters of Parafest
The collapse of the Parafest festival tents caused enormous damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially fit, and the event can also be organized next year.
Parafest’s last performer Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday night on the square.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the premises of the city theater from 13 a.m.
At the Art Center of Ahjo, the Parafest exhibition will be held at 13-15.
The program is planned.
The collapse flow occurs in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a decreasing air flow.
Changes in the condition of the water in the cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air cools and accelerates its pace towards the ground.
According to the Department of Meteorology, there are several floods in Finland during the summer.
The path of the collapse is difficult to predict.
The collapse struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the site of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed and there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care in a slightly injured condition.
Air pollution increases London population
Research has shown that the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of ageing is air pollution.
The study was by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many Londoners in retirement age are two and a half years older than their peers in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk especially for those Londoners who walk their work trips near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but as a more practical solution, regular skin cleaning is recommended.
Tractor brakes tricked a man in front of him
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man did not fall below it, but the tractor took the man to the point that he was transported to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not move further because it collided with the stones in front of it.
Strengthening for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Airball Championship League, will start the series starting in October from better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tone is sure to be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and unified.
Foreign trophy midfielder Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a 205 centimetre cracker.
Garchet is a passar, while the Brazilian measures 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Katajan and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every world championship since 2003.
Now in Tampere are going for the sixth time, only 2013 missed Canada was better in the North American quarters.
I was working in the market and playing with the local women’s club when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was setting up the Salibandy National Team.
I was interested and here we are now, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Rio, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataya and later in Jokipoj in ice hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university team in the SM series of the saliband in the 1991-92 season, the next three periods were held in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM Series 10 times, with a balance of 169 matches of 51 + 34 = 85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Tatu Väänänen and Perttu Puska were named in the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech EFT tournament in Brno from 6 to 8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played this before six men's land matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a hip disorder and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 land games experience.
In the national team was also named Seinäjoen Pelivratilor's concarrer Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the team is Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvala Sports Park.
During the three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the six best pairs in the ranking of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s grown Essi Hasu, who has been in the top of Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend this weekend.
It is going to be a great stadium.
I haven’t played very often in the adult series in Kouvolan, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvolan region lit Hasu’s spark to the sport and gave good meals to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started flying ball at the age of 9 with Elimäen NMKY’s E-girls.
The main thing in mind is a too big t-shirt, knee protectors rotating in the ankle, as well as stunning ass screams and choreographies after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment in which it was pleasant to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the action – the team-mate’s father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle’s beach volleyball was already a natural choice as a counterweight to indoor volleyball.
The swimming pool has been played since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went on to watch the junior SM-tour with the thought that someday I would be there to play.
Now this dream becomes a reality when Hasu will play together with Anniina Parkkinen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
The SM gold is still missing from the prize wardrobe, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s appearance in Kouvolan may be the last for Hasulle in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await us.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the toe shoes will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Two of the rooms were smaller.
The incident occurred on Friday at 17.
Firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, a journalist interviewed by Karjalainen, told the newspaper that there were elements involved in the major accident.
According to the newspaper, the event is in danger.

Solomon Koli became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and agility.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my story since I was a kid.
I’ve always liked working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If you want to do something, you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a housing facility, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
I myself, however, took a really courageous part in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn to good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cars, aims to invest in an even larger farm.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.

The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 % compared to December 2015 %) has been –0,2 %, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0,2 %.

Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and temporary care (0.5%) and health (0.1%)
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers say it is racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, around 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can transform yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a figure in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are undecorated, distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All illusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favouring blackface makeup or whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes wicked, distorted their teeth, and made their cheeks puddle, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people (“yellowface”).
Critics also wondered if these recurring contradictions suggest a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was by online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard a day after Snapchat said it removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them have denied the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the images were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and embarrassing.”
He adds: “It’s hard to deny the equalization of a very tasteless Asian cartoon with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a “yellowface”, but one taken to a degrading extreme.”
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion ranging from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are ethnically more diverse than their older counterparts. This can mean that they are likely to expect even more subtlety.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, this type of thing no longer easily goes unnoticed, as it used to be,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer at Medium, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article published in Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mostly white and exclusively male management and ended his writing with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that their one-sided staff doesn’t have colored people so they can make decisions like this, or they also have colored people as employees, but their status isn’t such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely dismissed the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesman said the company has recently hired a recruiter aimed at focusing on underrepresented groups and promoting inclusion within the company.
Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not OK.”
Congressional expert group claims military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
A panel of congressional experts released a report on Thursday that said U.S. Central Command officials modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war on ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what events on the ground suggested.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee’s intelligence and defence subcommittee set up a working group to report on the “general dissatisfaction” of military intelligence analysts in an interim report, according to analysts.
The Central Command, short for Centcom, is the U.S. military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence findings approved by Centcom's senior executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than the facts on the ground showed, and were, without exception, more positive than the analyses of other intelligence agencies," the report said.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when high-level political decision makers are presented with false analyses,” said California Republican Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's leadership errors extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that arose in 2014 and 2015, as included in Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
While the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administration were fake, it gives analysts an idea that the Centcom executives would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were,” the report says.
“For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a major military strike to recapture Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.”
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under the control of ISIS.
“After months of research, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican MP Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence leaders in the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated intelligence results to mitigate ISIS’s threat in Iraq.”
The Republicans set up a working group after learning of analysts’ suspicions that intelligence information about ISIS was manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, follows more detailed results as the investigations continue.
In addition, the Defense Ministry’s chief inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence information.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were in part consistent with the findings of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a too limited process for evaluating intelligence information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat in the committee.
Schiff said this process “delayed the release of intelligence findings, “offended the morality of analysts” and “insufficiently paid attention to divergent views.”
Schiff and Democrats, however, said there was no evidence that the White House had attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to “a predetermined or political official line.”
The Daily Beast news site on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times about an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, which was launched as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector’s investigation is ongoing.
He says, however, that: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other consequences in addition to trying to find out whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by an increasing number of defence officials).
However, last year’s allegations may have questioned how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command to give honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence data about ISIS corresponds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that the administration of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
Last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that despite opposing public statements, airstrikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries and thus been able to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the results of the investigation were not transmitted outside the Central Command, The Times in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers assessed the testimony given to the Senate as being too positive for war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The United States wins its fourth duel in women's land hockey and consolidates its position in a conflict with Britain
After scoring three goals in a win-win 6-1 match against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's land hockey national team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
“I’m not one of those people who care about the numbers they paint.”
But this is what he knows: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued to win with Japan’s 2-0 win on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which will decide which of them will be placed first and which of them will be second in the six-team block.
The first place avoids a longer time confrontation with a hard-thought Dutch team that won the second block.
Regardless of how Saturday’s game goes, the Americans have already raised the height of their surprising success in these competitions, four years after falling last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
He was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first entered the country hockey team when he was only 3 years old (his older twin sisters played at Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to survive the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 competitions, where he and his team had little to see successes.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental and physical,” says Bam.
“Our work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete translation.”
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half by hitting the ball nearby with a crossbow.
India had entered the game without any tournament victory, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and retained the 1–0 position until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, curled to the middle field, hit the ball to the goal and thus led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
It was the first game of the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the U.S. goal was drowned with each one hit.
Briggs is now living in a period of success.
Just like Bam.
"Our positioning is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of time and place, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, races, and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be coming next as a fierce message continuously and everywhere.
It was as if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming message bubble that passed from a bowfighter to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast, and from a gymnast to a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in the line of a cafe without necessarily hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or a quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic champion, charms with a smile and could well be the name on everyone’s lips that would appear and belong to the best time to watch and listen, be favoured by sponsors and appear in good-minded TV ads if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not equally illuminate all competitions.
Further away from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports such as air pistol shooting, bowling, shadowball, and taekwondo.
We will always have a backbone, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
Uncertainty can be regional.
Athletes from the United States have participated in Olympic trampolines, but the country has never reached medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men’s trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the women’s side, the Canadians have won.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of a low-rider, partly because it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I admit in this context that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The genre has its comic potential, which in cartoons has been used for the endless continuous jumping scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming, that is, the species that combine in a trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a jumping board.
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline, which snoops them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements, such as wires, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumping is judged by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship in trampoline gymnastics, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight forward.
In pursuit of gold, the medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the goal line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or starting wall, they also have another goal they aim for in television reports, namely, a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical—and even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find it a bit exhausting to just watch the games.
This trampoline provides a breathing break.
The trampoline is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast jumps up as a weightless astronaut, falls down and squeezes back up with no effort.
The genre, of course, also includes a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a fierce rush to the goal or jumping far, only a dreamy and digestive combination of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
The women’s racing matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 13:00 local time and the men’s corresponding matches will be held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 14:00 local time each day.
In the midst of the Olympic mania bring a quiet and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general hooliganism might be missed.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes to watch and objectivizing them – as American male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his encouraging new crowd of fans.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been killed in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia collapsing?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests, which are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights organizations said the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Video footage of the protests, presumably recorded at the end of last year or earlier this year, shows how security forces are beating young people who are forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Human Rights Commission is calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Panel at the African Horn project.
In terms of population, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, whose stability has been contributed by Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if any, receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy. Human rights organizations have continuously on the government's repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissenters are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If a people is repressed and has no choice but to show their minds, they will erupt out,” says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in Central Ethiopia.
“The whole youth is showing their minds.
A whole generation protested.”
There are many subjects of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the government coalition’s overthrow of power.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained even the last place previously held by the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the entire parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the June fighting.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromon Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the confusion and re-armed themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smart phones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became widespread and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many, however, access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their location.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this is how they invited people to protest.
Another reason is the growing solidarity between Ethiopia’s two largest population groups, the Oroms and the Amhars.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
The Amhars, who are mostly from the Christian upper lands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country’s politics and business and deprived the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lower areas.
But this is also changing.
“The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says Mulatu Gemechu, head of oromo.
The biggest protests have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the tiger tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between opponents.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, entered the boots of Meles from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who originated in the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces controlled by the tiger tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time a similar riot occurred in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated against elections that the government, according to analysts, first tuned and then stole.
In the post-election riots, many protesters were killed, but fewer were killed than in the previous months, and the riots ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their forward-looking infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress in fighting poverty.
But the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from growing.
And the outrage is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the town of Gondar attacked owned by tigers, and hate speech against tigers is growing on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in trouble.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, the U.S. said.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
“This requires a strict balance,” says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to pull back his words in a recent dispute he faced in his campaign by claiming he wasn’t serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the terrorist group ISIS’s “founders.”
The clarification raised new questions in the Republican side about the presidential candidate’s ability to clearly communicate to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in an embarrassing situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments, explaining comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election session on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said by claiming that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted that his allegations were sarcastic.
Trump tweeted his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was very serious about his accusations.
When radio speaker and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw from his claim.
The latest storm of criticism rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support numbers fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic line-up talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and called Clinton’s speech embarrassing.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism as he appeared to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email.
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls back his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that arouse feedback among his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then ‘resolves’ one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they’re round enough to go through different seals.”
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more pronounced as his support numbers have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal, and Marist, released on Friday, found that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida is strictly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being increasingly watched in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a disgraceful position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think his words are justified, a political speech,” Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called a “lower team” and that’s why it happened because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state, allowed ISIS to continue operating when it failed to resolutely address the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of blaming his speeches and discriminating against him.
He mocked “disrespectful and pityful” TV commentators who try to find out about him, but he says they can’t succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s statement, saying it just made it even clearer that he is not suitable for president.
Caffeine closed due to unreasonable rental increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly sluggish coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was available and there was no Wi-Fi, but which served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe had to be priced out of its streetfront on Bedford Avenue when the rental went up unreasonably.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Café in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this loss of a coffee shop that has been avoided by the middle class to be regrettable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB club no longer exists, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and the Verb is now a soap store.”
Although New York is no longer the same, it is also a new city.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a few miles north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still refined.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb Café is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer offered to fund the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things unchanged.
Verb orders the bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso model.
In addition, it even reintroduced the lamps of the old Verbi.
Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
Added new products to the list.
There are baked chicken egg cheese sandwiches available and filled with caprices and browned onion rings.
There are also black lashes on the list.
There is no beer in the coffee shop, but juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months at the cafe, Rodriguez says he has noticed that old regular customers are starting to go to the Verb with a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers also had to be priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made a walk to Verbi, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I knew I liked Verbi’s coffee and culture,” she says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a listing news.
Another longtime client, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I went to the cafe every day at about seven o'clock, like a machine, and there they were already preparing my voibageli with all the fillings," she says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders its standard products, but from time to time, she varies her bagels with bacon, chicken eggs, and cheese supplements.
Rodriguez says he is not resentful that the soap store took the old place.
Soap Cherie owners even offered to make a special soap made using Verbi’s own cold-boiled coffee.
“We can still grab the offer,” Rodriguez says.
Even the Poles who traditionally lived in Greenpoint have welcomed the cafe with pleasure.
One of the new customers translated the menu list into Polish, and Rodriguez says he is now looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought with it other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee from a coffee shop.
The cafe can also be expanded to the adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer at Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home,” says Whitt.
I missed the smell of coffee.
The Great Depression Food in a New Book: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting for lunch in his office in the White House.
Famous as a culinary, President Roosevelt liked the luxury meals of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose pasta and the Maryland Turtle Soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: devil’s eggs in tomato sauce, potato mousse, and a dessert from a peach.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, called Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a square-house in the Lower East Side neighborhood through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, is published by Harper and will be released on Tuesday, depicting the history of American food during the great downturn of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to a meeting place with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the great stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and Coe, 57, ordered turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat roast, the couple said it was suitable for a conversation about eating during a very long period of depression.
“The drinks were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate peanut butter, liver butter and paprika.
They were made of materials that were inexpensive and expensive.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is out.
"It must have been pressing in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the Great Lambs, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle of “eat as much as you want”.
The women prepared food for the farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner they served fresh fried pastries.
It was the Americans who had sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of how a nation survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
“This was a time when food became a central and annoying topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally disturbing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as sorrows and bacon dishes became the main food, and bacon dishes were said to be "a powerful way to harness food sources" because chefs may have covered the not-so-attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been the central part of American food for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
We experimented with strange mixtures, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values, not so much the taste or even the healthy sense of cooking.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared peanut butter-filled strawberries used as a shortage dish.
“It didn’t get popularity at the dinner table,” says Coe.
Ziegelman added: “It was unrealistic.
Butter and peanut butter are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as the head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, controlled citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be rigorous budgeters and to face the challenge of making spices like carrot-cream pagets tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tastes.
Particularly tasty are the accounts of the government’s reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “let me eat the cake” attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish and garlic sauce,” Coe says.
“He was almost eating in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a smoking.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to show an example with his stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the foods of the Lamas were abandoned as soon as the land was back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutritional intake, and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said they began to understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits better, such as why she couldn’t throw away food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” Coe says.
“People even started to feel bad about his food,” Ziegelman recalls.
“For example, the wind.”
After the main dishes were empty at the lunch bar in Eisenberg, Ziegelman and Coe picked up their home-made peanut butterfly, the same that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called pear foam,” Ziegelman says, adding that giving a look-like name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only feathers, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly plunged our spoon into a thick brown ice.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe scored a second and a third time.
“Nuts would make this better,” Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.
Gilead to receive full reimbursement for lawyer fees in a patent dispute over a hepatitis C drug with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to receive full compensation for the lawyer’s fees incurred by it in a patent dispute over the hepatitis C drug with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was released in June from $200 million in damages for breaches of two Merck-owned patents in connection with Gilead’s successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge found that Merck committed violations, including false oathing and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit recorded on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to be exempt from lawyer fees incurred for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead to dominate the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in court and claimed private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed troops have seized the city of Manbij.
U.S.-backed forces have seized the town of Manjib near the Turkish border in northern Syria when the last militants of the Islamic State group left the city, a military spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now hunting the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF’s Manbij military council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by Islamic State fighters had been released.
"The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, revealing that she and her husband earned $10.75 million at the time and paid a real federal tax rate of 34.2.
In 2015, the Clinton donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million in speech awards, and former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton announced that she earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book dealing with her term in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton’s vice president candidate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to look like models for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to always disclose their tax information, even if they are not required by law.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration's audit and say it's the reason why Trump hasn't disclosed his income data.
“The transfer is yours,” Clinton’s campaign assistant, Ian Sams, tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s tax data.
On Thursday, Trump’s special rights assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the checks were completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his donations to charities, his business relations and many other links, including his relations with Russia.
Clinton has grabbed the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are luring Trump to disclose his tax information.
Clinton spoke about this in a speech in Michigan on Thursday.
“Trump will refuse to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades and will not publish his tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid just a little for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist from the New York Times quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal taxes have become a key issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a Clinton election session last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway multinational headquarters is located in the same location, challenged Trump for a meeting where they both would reveal their tax details.
Buffett says he has also been subjected to tax inspections and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
Clinton’s campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clinton, who now live in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and the Clinton $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powdered condoms in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Conservatives in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements: they are harassed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
A few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
A long time ago, elephants were used to fight with spikes.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“After we developed the method, we’ve seen attitudes change in these villages, as now villagers can rely on being able to keep elephants away from their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, managing director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The invading elephant is first bullied by pointing at it with a pocket lamp and playing a torch.
If this does not work, throw away the chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in the condom together with the helmet, after which the head of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition thread remains outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder in the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a throw that fires fireworks known as a Roman candle in the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli direction number for Arab "encouragement" – RT News
A French, Jewish film director gave birth to a media outcry after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the Israeli destination number in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust Shoah document, defeated his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel from the destination list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann is writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the reception officer's response shocked him.
A reception official said the removal of Israel from the list was “a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason behind the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli address number."
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, told Suddeutsche Zeitung that the incident was a "great shame."
“The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It is a great shame.
And the more embarrassing it is considering that we are in Germany and it is this hotel chain.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the ambassador said.
The incident caused considerable resistance in the network, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a piece of publication highlighting the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
The hotel quickly denied the allegations, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to remove Israel from the destination list has never been issued," said a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the direction number has since been added to the list.
Brazilian police use tear gas and rubber bullets in student protest
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to demonstrate against the government’s public education reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when law enforcement officials tried to disperse the student crowd, as a result of which police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their outrage over the government’s plans.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin has proposed an austerity measure that will close 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters painted graffiti on the walls opposing the interim president Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place just days after the streets were filled with protesters in support of dismissed President Dilma Rousseff as the country’s Senate voted on the charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of the sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 percent, according to Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
He said the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has grown since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
“Russian companies are continuing their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Continuing to grow trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between the countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machines, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, the Russian foreign mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was among the first 20 countries whose citizens visited Russia for the first time.
And it’s not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotlander Callum Skinner wins British gold in cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner gained fame in the men’s team sprint at the velodrome in Rio last night, when the British trio defended the merited 2012 championship in London.
Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner played the anchor role he inherited from his Scottish countrymen Sir Chris Hoyl. The young man made the legend proud by praising the goal and grabbing the victory from a New Zealand team considered a pre-favorite.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago, when Hoy won its fifth of six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after only being ranked sixth at the World Cup in bike racing in London in March, despite Hoy’s subsequent abandonment of his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first director.
Hindus arrived at the right time.
Also, Hoy’s decision to end the race left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man in whom the British coaches believed and in whom they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in the time race, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
The British team won the gold duel.
Hindes was quite behind after his round, but Kenny strived to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down on a larger gear, allowing Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed as a BBC commentator and reached the eyes of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they climbed the prize ladder.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner says: “I’m stunned by the equalization.
I try to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to falling on the track intentionally due to a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the British competitors had no way to appeal.
This time, such problems were not associated with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says: “The atmosphere was like in London, all the British flags floated in the viewing room.
Our team has been united over the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten racing championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the last five months, there are five successful days ahead with the velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy’s achievements and win three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
This would mean adding six gold medals and one silver to Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medallions would then be the same as in Hoyl.
Kenny will compete next in a sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says: “At the moment, I can only rejoice about this.
Team competition is always the best.
You will enjoy winning together with your friends.
“Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must be awarded a knight's honor."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and winning gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be competing today on the second day of the race, with Wiggins at the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the competition dealers yesterday before the time run when the dealers called him to measure his length.
In the competition, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald from Milngawi set a world record of 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its powerful bike team to take over the mid-stage of the Olympics and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
Following the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The backdrop has been drama, the least of which is the resignation of technical chief Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the end of competitors for great athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the races held on the velodrome on the first night show that Britain’s already legendary reputation for climbing to the top at the perfect moment is once again being realized.
The future of the Portland melting plant is at stake due to the expiry of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company that supplies the melting plant with electricity said one of the factory owners was terminating the supply contract and all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is a result of the decision made by the Victoria government earlier this year not to continue subsidies to keep the factory in operation.
The fixed, 20-year support will cease in November.
Alcoa’s Portland plant is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs could be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry’s melting plant, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan’s Portland meltdown loses money and risks closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the factory’s future, initially caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum melting plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other melting plant owners to also terminate their contracts.
The majority ownership of the factory is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the factory.
AGL says it expects the Portland production facility to remain in permanent operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL says the agreements are so-called security agreements, which were scheduled to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential yield impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited by strong future market prospects in terms of wholesale market prices for electricity.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million "as a precaution for terminating the contracts."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the meltdown in operation or to secure the power supply to the meltdown.”
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was scheduled to enter into force from November this year, although it has yet to figure out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak financial situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious in their estimates of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL’s chief operating officer, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decline in demand in the (electric) market.
For us as a producer, this would not be good news,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall in September's Vogue cover
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and her mother and manager Kris's fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is the advertising face of Estee Lauder and has appeared at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the blanket in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover photo was followed by a strange (or maybe just the Kardashian style?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar brothers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favourite, Kardashian’s producer Ryan Seacrest) showing them forgetting their sister’s cover picture.
The plot is cliché, and is used in almost every episode of astounding birthday shows (Seacrest pronounces the words, "Did you think we forgot you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Chris had to get his other daughters somehow involved in this publicity.
The appearance on the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall’s grandmother, Kim, may have reached a lawsuit on Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is entirely in its own category.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling edition of the year.
A number that is more like a large image book than a fashion magazine with its thickness attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashion calculated that last year’s 832-page article contained 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue is expected with such enthusiasm that in the previous two years the images of the magazine have leaked to the publication even before the official announcement.
Previously, September cover models included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrities working as models on the cover than models who are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover photo in 2013, and a year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a successful model of his generation, and even though he would rather be among the celebrities who work as a model, he is still in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars, or contemporary kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry above others.
Beyoncé has one of the strongest years in her career last year, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of her true TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be a bullshit.
In June, Victoria’s Secret’s original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them “crabs.”
These feelings have come to the surface again when the news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the continuous insatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She walks on Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She is the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford’s daughter, which he portrayed to LOVE magazine.
And in his free time he appears on reality TV, just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centers evacuate 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable countries are removed from the legal aid centers, and the sector is preparing for the impact of additional budget cuts on centers already at the border.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are being removed – most of them elderly people, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for additional budget cuts.
As of June next year, the legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30 percent more of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, said the latest report by the National Organization of Legal Assistance Centres showed that thousands of people are displaced every year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being displaced as they seek the essential services they need,” says Farrell.
“People out of violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and rampant burden of debt, dismissed families, unjustified workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent starting in June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland’s most disadvantaged will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to stop these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its pledge to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of the public legal aid centres and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk Board must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign sued for threatening employee with gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued after allegedly no action was taken after its leadership was informed that a campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened a worker with a gun while they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini before a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be addressed within the campaign before he understood, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip “raised his pistol, put his right front finger on the slider and pressed a pin on Vincent’s knee.”
According to the petition, after filing a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same phillip.
"Even if a gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate sparked public anger by telling the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of the Second Additional Paragraph” – which holds gun owners and weapons enthusiasts – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to elect judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his words from context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for indifference, and compensation from Phillip for harassment, abuse and mental suffering caused by them.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message asking for a comment.
Phillips was not reached despite attempts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB said Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call request submitted to Phillip’s consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revitalizes the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and in London, but across the country.
For me, this was the thing that most interested me at Heathrow.As at the 2012 London Olympics, we invested enormously in ensuring that our entire nation and all of our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the airport neighborhoods.
As with the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
With regard to the Olympics, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we are in a shameful situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and grow the economy by £211 billion. It will bring skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and budget, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway backed by a £16 billion private investment.
The 2012 Olympics in London were a great success for our country, and I am confident that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit in the expansion of Heathrow, so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Heathrow’s Chairman of the Board and former Trade Secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad block in cat-mouse game
The attempts of companies making money from online advertising to mislead ad-blocking software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one of the companies producing blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its website that it would block ad-blocking programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post stating that users could upgrade the filters of their ad-blocking software to block social media ads again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change the ad tag codes on its desktop site so that ad blocking programs will find it harder to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now Adblock has revealed the new code.
Ben Williams, a spokesman for Adblock, wrote in a blog post that “such a ballooning between the open-source ad-blocking community and misleaders has been ongoing since the invention of ad-blocking” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own corrective move again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the battle is a strong indication of how much concern advertising managers have developed in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking programs, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year.
Facebook has 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company, however, plans to invest in misleading ad blocking programs in its desktop app, as the mobile ad blocking programs do not work in Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
Revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update its user preferences ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters for stating that they also block the appearance of some regular Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to fix the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
“Ad-blocking programs are dull and ineffective, which is why we’ve invested in developing user settings like advertising tools so people can control their targeting.”
Woman commits suicide by falling under cars on Swiss highway
He was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for eyewitness assistance on the highway in the first hours of Thursday, in which the woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud Canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman committed her desperate act by laying down on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly to commit suicide.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
It remains to be seen whether the accused drivers will be charged.
Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
It remains to the prosecutor to find out,” says Hofstetter.
In the past five years, there have been two similar incidents that lead to drivers not being held accountable.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person was walking on a dark highway and the court ruled that drivers cannot expect to collide with pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from charges against him for a death sentence after he struck a man lying on motorway A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and stalled on the road.
The court ruled that the policeman – who was responding to the emergency call – was driving justified and the man lying on the road was “a totally exceptional and unexpected situation.”
Anyone who knows anything about an accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
NASA’s new climate model estimates that Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that allows the past of Venus to be studied using the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was intended to find out whether conditions on Venus may have sometimes been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus' surface is hot and waterless and its gas atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its thick atmosphere.
Based on the latest simulation, however, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to investigate the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation there to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In GISS modeling, Venus is rotating slowly and its day half is almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and generates rain, which creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like a umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the Earth’s current temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
When hydrogen came into space, only a thick carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained – that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers the results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to resign as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and Deputy Chief Hockey Officer, citing a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Colorado vice president and chief executive Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“Over the last three years, I have served my role as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of the club’s ice hockey business with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
"During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to this, the coach and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the club’s hockey business must be fully aligned with the organization.
He must also have a voice in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Royl was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as Avalanche's head coach in 2013-2014.
Under his leadership, the club scored 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the drop-off games and has not been able to reach a continuation in the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39-39-4 in the 2015–2016 season and was five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing for another Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy has won four Stanley Cups in his career – two at the Montreal Canadiens and two at the Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say the wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be suspended when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, a company that provides oil field services, has been subjected to strikes at drilling boards located in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute.”
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of day-long meetings over the coming weeks to address issues from fresh aspects.
The unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut tariffs for its contractors operating in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows the reduction of the prices of contractors working in the countries by 10 percent in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the movement space it needs to cope with the market decline.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to abandon oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries.
The lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour struggles experienced in the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared to about $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of the stars in the Plejadic star cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission has been to measure the speed of the star’s rotation, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Plejadic cluster so far.
Based on the new data, astronomers can find out why stars in the same star cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotation times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena.
The Plejadic star cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born approximately 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching adulthood.
They are now rotating faster than ever.
At its peak speed of rotation, large amounts of star winds are erupting from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the star's magnetic fields.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (which correspond to solar spots).
The latest listed speed data suggests that larger stars are rotating slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger ones rotate slower than smaller ones.
“We see from the ‘dance’ of the Pleiadians that slow-rotating stars are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating ones are typically very lightweight stars,” says Rebull.
Because the Plejadic star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars in relation to the speed of rotation.
“The Plejadic cluster provides a supporting pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We still want to learn a lot more about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their “dance.”
Rebull and colleagues will present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
