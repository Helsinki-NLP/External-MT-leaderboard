Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about being seen as puppets
Welsh elected officials are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal follows from the draft change of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some Members of the Assembly believe that this could be mocked.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the syllable  rhymes with Twp and Pwp .
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Party) is not satisfied and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party is reportedly open to a name change, but noted that the distance between MWP and Muppet is narrow.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the letter u in the English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, has indicated that the final decision on the nomination of the members of the Assembly is for the latter.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
The Commission is in favour of Welsh Members of Parliament (WMP) on the issue of the title of members; however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the House are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the House, who is due to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall take the final decision on the question of the name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name of Macedonia is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in trouble, bells of St. Martin silenced
 The older people I've talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner , Mr. Adams says.
 There is no more today 
He said it was normal for bars to have become scarce.
Today, he explains, dating is no longer the same.
Previously, we used to go to the bar like we went to our neighbor's, but now we don't.
As for the church, the proceeds from the sale of buildings will run out long before the elders think they can, and that's their concern.
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighbourhood.
 The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will hurry the closure of all churches, as they are unlikely to become members, he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The first white Methodist congregation left the area in the 1930's.
A black congregation preaching in the area took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where blacks struggled to get jobs or promotion.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
That Father Johnson's son and successor at the head of St Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "Bells of the Poor".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played in July, gave it a completely different name:  a cultural treasure  and  an irreplaceable historical instrument .
It also mentions that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the larger carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims St. Martin's did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the displacement of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese would impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark at lobster fishing
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was fishing lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and started paddling to him to get him out of the water.
At first Chad thought the boy was shouting for joy that he had been caught, but then he realized that he was actually
It was bitten.
When Hammel came near the young man, he noticed that he had an open fracture in his clavicle.
"I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark!" Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, Chief Rescue Officer Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered safe.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's is a backstop for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and is filling them with supermarket-like beams, filled with cosmetics and beauty products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of £2.8bn, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods are falling, wider beauty product lines will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is successful.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees lines will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, a growing criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concession contracts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is due to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket managers need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly shopping online and heading to nearby grocery stores for everyday food.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsburys, said that retail outlets will increasingly resemble large areas as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsburys has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors to several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which the group says has helped to drive sales of current consumer goods and make acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the UK pharmaceutical and cosmetic chain's beams have failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsburys tried to partner with Boots, but it ended after a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, into four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Manager at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty product beams has been changed to improve the environment for customers.
 We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our beams and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes buying habits, Mills-Hicks added.
Anger of Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an £11m deal
Anger of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones after announcing the withdrawal of animator Holly Willoughby from a £11 million contract with her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, by withdrawing from their successful textile and interior decoration business at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV's beloved child revealed at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon Den star's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new £1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their interior décor and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was equated with that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
And it is on its way to securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
Nobody could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, who is one of Britain's most bankable celebrities, could cost the company millions, owing to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles to clothing or interior goods, and the risk of a delayed launch.
And it could end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of that year.
The couple were going on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take over from McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night he didn't want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but we finally loved it.
Trump has been ridiculed by the media who criticize him for commenting that some consider unworthy of a president, and for showing such positive views of the North Korean leader.
 Why did President Trump give up so much? ,
He laughed, taking a TV journalist's voice.
I've given up nothing at all.
He said Kim Jong-un had shown favour to a second meeting after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are still pending.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no corresponding US response to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
He deplored the fact that the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rally speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
 Everything is fine with North Korea , says the North American president.
We've been through the armed conflict.
 Millions of people were reportedly killed.
We have a great relationship now.
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of North American military remains to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
 It is so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crumbling arena, there are barely more than 200 of them standing in front of me, he criticized, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: devastated island and hundreds of dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10% of the population of Lombok was dispersed, but no national disaster status was declared as a condition for international aid to be launched.
 Unfortunately, they have made it clear many times that they do not want international aid, which complicates matters a bit , regretted Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shaking, the country lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no siren alarm sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new disaster site.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has put the reform of decaying infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent considerable money on road and rail repair.
However, the lack of funds undermined Mr Joko's government, which was called to stand for election next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the continuing interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians lost their lives and tens of thousands were driven from their homes amid street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arrows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is able to qualify against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Premier League defeat to Liverpool against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led 1-0.
He shot the ball on his left, before a shot escaped to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
 I was just trying to get in position, to grab the ball but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible , Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before running into midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in the middle of the field,
Then he fired a magnificent deep shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defence and finished his race in the second pole net, with a shot in the left foot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: tsunami death toll to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami accounted for 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With a population of over 380,000, Palu was filled with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the neighbors who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements:  The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I call on the taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their dash cam, and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a property in Birkenhead where she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the scene and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his flat in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building will be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confided that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman stood there crying.
I repeat: it's too horrible.
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cord, and another outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the rope.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Failure Agency anonymously at 0800 555 111, according to register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the rightful return of things, given the destruction of countless religious and cultural property in England by its puritan supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal unreasonable and has called it a revisionist attempt.
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Palace of Westminster was not to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted the Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that he sacrificed himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the respect for him in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a personality many of us still celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph:  Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of course of the monarchy.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of highlighting and commemorating.
China: a pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
The man, identified as M, Yuan, was found dead, his artery cut and covered in blood near a pork market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door in the nearby pigsty open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the 250 kg animal mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that  his legs were crushed and covered in blood .
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
Her body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent further incidents and allow the police to gather evidence.
The family of Mr Yuan's farmer and the market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although there are few reports, there have been reports of pig attacks on people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring them.
Ten years earlier, a 200-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to drive it away.
In 2012, when an Oregon rancher was just eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it's not an aggressive animal in principle, but that blood taste can cause this kind of behavior.
They're rather playful animals.
They're very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting anyone.
Just show them the respect they deserve.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rainfall in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds had been blowing at 135 km/h (category 1) since 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula as a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical moisture to move northward into the southwestern United States.
It will rain up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 centimetres will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will be between 5 and 7.5 cm/h in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to rain between 5 and 10 cm in southwestern regions, particularly much of Arizona.
Spread tropical rainfall can cause sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is highly advised not to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers, and storms could produce winds and dust storms in places.
The approaching depression will lead to heavy local rains in some southern regions of the country, along the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach over 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and cause the footprint to slip.
It may be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rainfall will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature changes are expected for October across the United States due to cooling in the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
This can lead to a drastic change in time over short distances.
The central United States, where temperatures will vary considerably on Sunday, is a perfect example.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees Celsius covering the southern plains and other areas of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
The forecast for several days indicates that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first 15 days of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial draws more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television stations on Thursday, the hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were watched by more than 20 million people.
As the political deadlock continues, the broadcasters have cut off their usual Friday program to announce a game show: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford assured herself 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been touched by alcohol and tried to take off his clothes at a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be 100% sure that this never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial was reportedly heard by more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen is not always able to estimate how many people watch TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was the second largest with a viewership of 3.26 million.
It was followed by CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), all according to Nielsen.
Interest did not wan after the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras uncovered a scene in which the senator is taken in by protesters as he attempts to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes as CNN broadcast the interpellation sequence live.
Don't look anywhere else, look at me, woman's moon spear.
Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are poor.
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and would be speaking more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering the live session a few hours later as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, as the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was a heavyweight on the balance sheet, as Republicans would not have actually gotten the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a preliminary inquiry.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making small politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, of making small-scale policies at the expense of Britain's future and national interests.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the paper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, saying the proposed free trade between Britain and the European Union was  purely ridiculous.
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was stabbed and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene, the glasses were wearing Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS Group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, which determined that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University police, and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice.
Sims was only 20.
The 6-foot-1, 98-pound player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by news of Wayde's death.
"We're always afraid of this kind of event", Wade regretted.
Mexico: A volcano spits ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several rumbling and shaking from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity at the volcano 72 km from the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the eve of the independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colorful powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not empty tourists.
The riots also broke out later that day, while the police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who were scandaling about neither forgetting nor forgiveness faced unionists shouting long live Spain.
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups camped Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
The other was in the same place, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was taking part with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope of Catalonia's independence.
Last year we witnessed a great moment.
My parents were crying from joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in a dead end.
Despite their decisive, albeit slim, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many popular leaders in exile or detention awaiting trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police demonstration on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
 The tension is just rising  he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pending trial since last year, announced his intention to stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
 This is for me the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government, he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly breaking into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly hit by arrowshot.
Livingston wins the game 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently promoted, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second 18-game win over Steven Gerrard, the current head coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to finish second in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are without a win in the Premier League this season and must face the Hearts on Sunday, who lead by 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid at the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, they have extended their unbeaten streak in the division by six games, and their head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he has not lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face down a disgruntled opponent
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before scoring, as their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to break but was stuck in front of the opposing goal; a late intervention by Alan Lithgow followed, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that they could get in their way with their tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to lock in Menga, who took a touchdown and scored a goal from midfield.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half was the same, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a Scott Pittman strike, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston keeper repulsed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand-off.
The Livingston phenomenon - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They've all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top, but Holt is largely credited with having motivated a team since his arrival.
Which has a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the game for the rest of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to break through the opposing side once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Police, citing security reasons, prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan's dual vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some German of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived on the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything possible to identify the individual and alert his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been set up.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security prison for men said that six prison guards were injured in a riot.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30am local time on Sunday and is still uncontrolled.
Special riot police were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 inmates and held in a prison wing.
On the spot, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison administration said:  Specifically trained personnel have been deployed to restore order at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the authorities will have to answer to the police and their sentences may be prolonged.
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, are being held in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized after being assaulted by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked the staff with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week, with Hurricane Rosa heading toward the southwestern desert with its remaining energy, a region that could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with forecast rainfall beginning Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, and up to 15 inches per area in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to experience 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be life-saving for areas affected by drought that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rainfall could be beneficial for the southwest region given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona has at least one extreme category of drought, the second most severe category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is making its way up the coast in the lower California peninsula.
Still strong on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and could lead to flooding.
 In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California to northwestern Sonora and could reach up to 25 cm. , weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
 Heavy rainfall is expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and is the main threat , the National Hurricane Center explained.
It is estimated that these precipitation will lead to sudden potentially deadly floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at about 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital and is currently in stable condition.
Avon and Sommerset Police said they had arrested the four young men (ages 17, 18 and 20) at night on the Radstock side.
Officers have made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of the Democrats' wickedness and anger
 A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party , Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting them as teenagers decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage on this day.
 A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service , he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks from the most important election of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever, he said.
That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates.
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican Party official who told CNN.
Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis, the record continues to grow
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake followed by a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu when a six-meter-high wave overflowed the beach at dusk, taking many lives and destroying everything along the way.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
 When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, everyone was still on the beach.People did not immediately flee, it cost them their lives , Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
 The tsunami did not happen alone. It dragged cars, pieces of wood, houses, took everything with it, Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The ripples continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage was considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the loss of human and material resources could be greater on the 300km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were  completely paralyzed  from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there , the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
 The situation is dramatic and could well get worse , she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building frantically screaming to passersby on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to send aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami is rising, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The Donggala World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they took refuge in shelters in their office yard, and along the way they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to help the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And it hasn't happened yet.
 This disaster is still considered regional , says Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 As soon as the government declares it a national disaster, international assistance will be available.
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday struck Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers unleashed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were held a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr Mandagi added.
"As an elder in the parachute discipline, I've experienced my own dramas", he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse in the parachute community, Mr Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages were unanswered.
I don't think they ever got my messages.
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 while charging an ATM
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was sitting in a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man came up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the dealer.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is welcome to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West now goes by the name Ye.
Announcing the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote:  Formerly known as Kanye West. 
West, 41, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made the change just before he went to Saturday Night Live, where he is set to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled her arrival for emotional reasons, the show's creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has religious significance for West.
 I think Ye is the most used word in the Bible, where it means toi, West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
Then I am you, I am us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye, the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
West isn't the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs got himself called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on the union line and the capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after law enforcement officers bloodyly retaliated against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square never to use military force to repress the Mexican people.
On 2 October 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding in this field, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several US government actors made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the US.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
 Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries are one step ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next big AI discovery , says Lee.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book  AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order  was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, then joined the Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
 It is not China that owns academic leaders, it is the companies , says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited leading academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support US efforts on AI.
 I think the green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers , he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academic partners.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In parallel, US legislation to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining the minimum 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was:  Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece? 
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
 I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, whereas it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilised 66% of registered voters after the vote.
 I have come to vote for my children.  Our place is in Europe , says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, took part in the referendum and voted for the name change to open the voice to NATO and the European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
 We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door , said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will enable Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investment.
 I think a large majority will be in favour, as over 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO, Zaev said after submitting his ballot.
He added that a  yes  would be a  confirmation of our future .
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would like to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout rate.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50 percent of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed to be the easiest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed one defender before defeating the others just outside Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English forward took advantage of the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
 Aguero has some foot problems , Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, told reporters.
We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game,
As of the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball straight to Brighton's court.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues frontman sent the ball into the net just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party jam against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, a very competitive player, hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if this game is not a challenge, we want to step on the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I'll ever have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will be in his 34th start, will be training Thursday and will be starting on his usual Sunday rest day.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Speeches in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation in which his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court was generated by speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
 All our actions will have an impact in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is a major challenge. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they're determined to take back power by any means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, and that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
 You can see this in the last four days , he added, before calling the Democrats angry, mean and lying people 
He spoke to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public acclaim.
 Do you remember his answer? 
Did you leak the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer the big community it was.
He's not tolerant of those who express their opinions
When activists from the Momentum movement in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all because they have expressed our views.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, these are subjects on which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said:  We want the rally to be inclusive and productive. 
This is exactly what the general assemblies on Friday night were like during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in many meetings today and the promise of more gentle and respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It became clear that opposing views were no longer tolerated within the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared a political vision began to expect me to turn my back on my jacket and take positions that were contrary to my convictions, whether it was on national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was a bullying thread on social media, calling for a withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the Centre, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to me were political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a barrage of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current policy is the standardization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this big community and the party is narrowing down as motion of no confidence and changes in the selection rules go on.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years: lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so loudly, and everything would be fine.
But I do not do politics in the same way.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolteacher because the Thatcher government's negligence had caused my classroom to collapse and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my differences with the current party leaders.
All I would say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are in your interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late tests may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about that: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match of the 15th day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
The team now ranks top of the standings and is the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it was their superior defense and the way they took the opportunities that allowed them to open the scoring.
"We have been tested until now, but we have not been defeated. I should consider ourselves blessed".
Robyn Christie from Melrose congratulated Ayr:  Good for them, they were more effective than we were and they took advantage of the opportunities. 
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish side Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers out.
Climo made the situation worse for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half, he scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long wait followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a mattress.
Blair Macpherson, interim captain of DAyr, was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the penalty kick, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's jaw, which was progressing.
Climo changed the test, as almost every time since the takeover, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home test.
Still Game star is getting into the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in catering.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the show's final season, and Kiernan appears to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant scene in Glasgow.
 The sea is ours : Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored ship at naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto:
It's a duty to recover it.
Across the blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have been less than tangible for decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
 Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome , explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of the Bolivian request.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
 We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean , he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Chile's favor and that little will change, even if a positive decision is made.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice has given its decision six months after the final arguments shows that the case was not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than supporting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have even hurt her.
 The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration , Zárate said.
Morales's bellicose rhetoric undermined all remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organise talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime problem as a political bait.
 Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean , he added.
 The Court's decision is an opportunity to show that we must get rid of the past. 
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
The United Nations General Assembly on Saturday made a statement.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reviving a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
It is not a sham to think that the United States' continued sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any prior significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest trends in headgear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100 percent, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their delicious oversize hat collections at a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
More fancy hats than others have flooded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to incorporate their delirious pieces into the shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized items included jewelry-decorated pastries, a witch hat, and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than High-Couture.
One creature looked like a diving gear, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you follow the trends of fashion, then you're in luck.
According to fashion observers, the huge hats could come all the way down to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the trail of the Bomba, the wide-body straw hat that stars pull from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus' PE19 La Riviera parade at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big beach hats and bags coming to stores next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their pupils for higher education, for their chosen careers and for their place as world citizens.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing tailored curricula, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you're talking to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you're talking to his heart.
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
If you look at the excellent results in this year's examinations, you can see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade, A.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils achieved the highest grade of A in Mandarin, as did 72% of pupils who studied German, 69% of pupils who studied French and 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now languages as subjects are organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 shows that 17% of the difficulties employers face recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for future careers.
With more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from this lasting skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically put the multilingual person ahead of his or her competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
If children speak several languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have better chances of finding rewarding jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that at present, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country.
Modern languages must be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James will play Sunday in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
 More than one, less than 48 , Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season programme, which includes six matches.
 At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready. 
Trump's campaign in West Virginia (Youtube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops are planned, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to gather support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. eastern time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault, that took place this week, and Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain ground in the November election.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority.
 Congressional control is such a critical part of his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible in this busy election campaign, a spokesman for the Trump team, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday, it will be Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
 It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will have to come and try to revive him in the polls, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA ready to fight to keep hope as Sunday's singles approach
After three straight, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swinging movement of the Elan is a sporting concept invented out of thin air but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments like this.
Where would they put the momentum now?
 They were leading by six points and now by four, so that gives us some wings , Jordan Spieth said as he was returning for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and 12 more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, including Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been together all day and can boast of each scoring three out of four points.
Spieth has shown himself to be terribly effective from green tea and is setting an example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his game progressed, and a crucial putt allowed him to tie the game in the fourth as he and Thomas were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, which won the game on the 15th hole, sparked a similar outcry from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in the race.
 You really have to stay determined and focus on your game , Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair have won four out of four matches and have no right to make a mistake.
Not only were  Moliwood  the only ones who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the mad crowd, designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to take a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf Course.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
But speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning fiddle hero, while he was teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
But on Sunday, nobody's here to help you.
The four-wheelers and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made a considerable advance over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a strong lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after beating the United States 10-6 in Saturday's foursomes and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods in distress, which has allowed them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by beating a disorderly American team 3-1 in the morning foulballs.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must earn eight points out of 12 on Sunday in singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, nicknamed Molliwood after a disastrous weekend, are only the second Ryder Cup team in history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they beat the pair consisting of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled during both Saturday's games, has been a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in foursomes and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning foursomes, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively world No. 1 and No. 3.
Europe was not spared in the tournament, which took place in the southwest of Paris, in cool but clear weather.
Triple-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the foursomes and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, with the latter losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had to play a draw to retain their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says disarmament cannot be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions increased his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organisation's Annual General Meeting, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken important goodwill measures last year, such as ending such nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
 However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States , he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticisms of Washington's opposition to a  step-by-step approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula  while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected requests to ease the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea denuclearize first and is increasing pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the "declaration of an end to war".
 Those who think these sanctions can rob us of our rights don't know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.
No comment was made on the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added:  If the party concerned in denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate. 
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's when he declared before the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after the evil President Trump called Kim a suicide missile man.
Trump, who last year threatened the United Nations to "totally destroy" North Korea, did not praise Kim's courage this year in implementing disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set. It could take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter, he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that:  The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization. 
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but within hours North Korea denounced its gangster methods.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took equivalent action.
He said that Kim demanded Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students taking rest classes
This year, Harvard University has launched a new course that allows all undergraduate students to get more sleep and combat the growing male-dominated tendency to study by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most students at the world's best university don't know how to take care of themselves
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that he came up with the idea
Finally, a student came up to me and said, "Why am I only being told this last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance and overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of university health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of various interactive exercises.
One section presents an image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books, etc.) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
 We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know this information - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking , added Professor Czeisler.
He said the culture of pride in spending a night out still exists, and he added that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
He said that getting enough and good quality sleep should be students' secret weapon for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a sleep mode, leaving them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after he was a student last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and made him insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar programme of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another hard blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were hoping to record their first on-the-field win since their 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers, in a short period of inspiration, failed to tie.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from a throw from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 that scored a point at the Hearts last week and would have been thrilled to see his well-trained team choke his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored in the second minute when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized after the shot when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' arrested kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted midway through the season by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger came to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to make the block.
Livingston nevertheless continued to encourage visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead at the last minute, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was fighting Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURN COMPUTER... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: What is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger meter, used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
These headphones can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.
Evans:  So tell me, it's sure to jump right here! 
 Hans  Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect and kill cancer cells
As part of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then detect a protein that is common to many cancers, and then inject it again.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which is designed to teach her immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said:  Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. 
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2  protein causes the growth of several types of cancer , including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, involving the removal of immune cells to teach them how to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
With a MAGA cap, Kanye West started a pro-Trump rant after joining SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast in the lead role after a rousing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live and announced he would run for election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West was taken by the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
 Many times I talk to white people and they say:  How can you love Trump?
 Well, if racism were my concern, I would have left America a long time ago  he claimed.
The SNL show began with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me !
And then they say I'm in a hole, he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the abyss?" and he said he would wear his Superman coat because no one can dictate his actions.
Try love.
His comments drew him at least twice from the audience and SNL members appeared embarrassed, Variety reports.
West had been called in to replace singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West discouraged many people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted:  To one of the most courageous minds: THANK YOU for your head on the fence. 
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was just being true to himself, and that's absolutely wonderful.
 However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music, clothes or supporting their art) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Accused of attempted murder after white-armed assault at a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant in east Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the public service.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, takes on the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the HBO violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor is taken to the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this type of screen role often leads young boys to pretend to be tough cooks to get respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something is wrong and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the #MeToo moment.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Game of Thrones star, admitted that he was "firmly" committed to tackling the issue.
 Personally, I deeply believe we have abused masculinity. 
 What lessons have we given young men who are growing up in relation to the problem that is now arising? 
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued:  What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What does television and the street teach young boys that makes them think that they must behave like this to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be making any prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he's done with the battlefields and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
 I met my wife on this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on , he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been contaminated through sexual intercourse, a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the LGBT community in China, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that any GOP employee disclosed any data about the senators, and denounces dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, US Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were supported by experts and websites of the far right.
 Lies, lies, and even infamous lies  Waters reacted in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information leaked included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and disclosed information about a Waters staff member.
According to Waters,  this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie .
 The member of my team whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information 
 This false allegation is completely false and a true lie. 
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
 This denial is anger , he wrote.
 This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
She must not be provocative.
It must not challenge the accuser's reasons.
She must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
 If it's true, it's huge , he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters indicated that its office had alerted the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned of these fraudulent claims.
 We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed , she added,  and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts to all members of my team 
Johnny English is hitting again, a parody of Rowan Atkinson, a gifted spy.
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the uncompetent Johnny English, with his eyes scarred and his face rubbery, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - a name that indicates above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who runs a small note in The Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It was also originally inspired by the traveller and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has a nice moment or two.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially when serious releases like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently compose themselves with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me Johnny English's wild misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The premise that is always up to date is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrated the top-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agents on duty - a role unfortunately of little importance for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the bottle for a prime minister who is a pompous figure on the brink of crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to be done about the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she'll have to get someone out of her retirement.
That means you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly teaches lessons on how to become a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers a spy academy like Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and meets Bough, his longtime partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are causing trouble for His Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatalistic woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farcical jokes: under the guise of servers, they set fire to a bursting French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta's luxurious sailing ship; and English tries to unleash a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are secured for this last sequence, but still, there's a lot for the kids in all of this.
It's a moderate movie.
I couldn't help but think, as with Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow British people to work four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still receiving the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic programme and plans to orient the country towards workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A major Labour Party source told the Sunday Times:  A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year. 
 This will not be done overnight, but a four-day work week is an objective that goes hand in hand with the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and its overall industrial strategy 
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party had pledged to support a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said:  A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party. 
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell declared his determination to take back power from the anonymous directors and beneficiaries of public utility companies.
The Deputy Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their investment since the Labour government could make deductions due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into the boards of directors and to set up an inclusive shareholder fund which will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will receive up to £500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy confide in 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the allegations against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
On my way to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved in stone.
I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge, he claimed.
 Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people she names couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don't see anything new that changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive star list and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people rally to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to benefit from the services of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's true goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which had its first edition in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or doing any other useful effort to raise awareness about poverty.
But how far can Global Citizen still reach its target in the next 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of clicktivism - a situation where people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million shares of shares from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to inspire world leaders to commit and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and practitioners who have pledged to help children reach their full potential, while pledging £35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
 With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history , Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5 000 actions to call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, what makes you think extreme poverty can be ended?
Global Citizen said:  The road to that will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform this year in New York City, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The US could call on the Navy to create a blockade to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
To prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington may, if necessary, call on the US Navy, Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of the Interior, told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - was a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
 I believe they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe, he is said to have said.
The official said there were ways to remedy this.
 The United States, together with our Navy, can ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that their energy is not put on the market , he added.
Zinke was speaking to the participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation which defines itself as the spokesperson for energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are in fact identical.
 For Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less fuel exploitation and replacement, he said, while referring to Russia as having more than one rope in its arrow with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply economically motivated and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The US position has generated negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
 I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply , said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president in the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
 It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top , she says, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for President.
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
 I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy , she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a tweet, Warren said: "Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters disagree that she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts' likely voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democratic names mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD during the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
 What my own son is feeling right now, what he's feeling coming home, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with  she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a taboo subject and said about his son and other veterans that they are coming back a little different, hardened, wondering if they respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a motion in favor of an asylum seeker who disputed the policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions, opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said that her partner and her sons, gang members, had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District of Columbia's attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
 Federal law states that all asylum applications must be considered according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle , stated in his memo amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued that immigrant denial policies are detrimental to the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
 Asylum is granted to people who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,  said Sessions on 11 June in its policy announcement.
 Asylum was never designed to mitigate all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world. 
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more dramatic.
 I feel very tense , said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-ridden little boy in Palu, an evacuation center in the empty city.
 An ambulance is bringing bodies back every second.
Clean water is rare.
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up sunken property and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong backlash.
His eyes filled with tears when he told how he felt the powerful earthquake that shook the room he was staying in with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of the hotel.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe, Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of intimidation through propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the surcharge paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the US parliamentary election on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Accusing Beijing of interfering in the US election, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing Washington-led campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed by a growing trade war that has led them to impose reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at targeting exporters from states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
 In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register , writes Branstad.
 However, at the Beijing press box, you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party , he writes.
He added that  one of China's most important newspapers avoided publishing his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters as midterm elections approach due to the Kavanaugh debacle
While many senior Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said that there is no going backwards.
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in support of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn,  women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November , she said on September 28, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate lobby as the Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to push ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
 Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overestimated , said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that the reaction might be vivid if the Republicans pushed for confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week that it had become a confusing mess for the GOP.
 It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or Kavanaugh's appointment, but also about how the Republicans have handled the situation and how they have handled it , Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the TV newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, Americans seem divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority favoring the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of people surveyed believed Ford's testimony absolutely or likely, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's free-to-play Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and who is authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt was aiming to  dominate the world .
"We have to do it now", he said of the launch.
 This is a historic moment. 
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data store or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this personal responsibility via data.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on dInrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not yet in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely messed up in an instant.
 We do not ask for their permission. 
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the mission of [dInrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
 I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web , added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the distinction on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, however, and was unaware that he had achieved the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, claimed that it was brilliantly symbolic to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazatte, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Channel through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with the greatest bravery, led the line before blowing up a field gun himself and killing three detachment soldiers.
On 4 October 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I will never be able to do, but it makes me humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give him.
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of Peppa Pig.
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a full-loaded Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main footage, and was broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they stayed up until the early hours of the morning, especially for the battle.
A Twitter fan described the passage to the children's cartoon as a kind of bad joke.
On the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said that the government regulations stated that at 6am the content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children's programmes.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
 I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably find a solution , Coker said.
 However, it is six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages going both ways and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that won't happen next time.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give more to the fans and we screwed it up.
This is a regrettable situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to himself in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everyone else [was] not like me.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he said he spoke about gay rights issues to give others lp .
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt less than all the other children growing up because it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said:  Even today, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed. 
He went on to say that he wanted to prove that he was something, so that when they finally learned the truth about her sexuality, he would not disappoint everyone.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give hope back to others.
The three-time world champion has said he didn't expect to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, 20 years her senior, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
 When he saw so much at such a young age  - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he confidently says that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his whole outlook had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I only thought about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confessed that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be in the front row anymore,' he said.
I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him a while to stop breathing and he died before I finally realized he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"This is all I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's nothing better", he said.
In addition, it inspired her first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied her during Olympic preparations and always gave her chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover to avoid an unfortunate turn.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the 12th time, a record, was disqualified by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as has so often been the case for the United States, the five-time Grand Champion has divided his day between the supporting role and refining his booth game to remedy his ailments.
He was never the greatest of the leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the best fit for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes missed shots.
And as if the course wasn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faced British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down in the first 12 games of the singles, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
 He fully understood the role he had to play today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , Furyk said.
He has great confidence in himself.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I was planning on more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries to his credit, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room, he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed playing him this week, which was fun to watch.
He does much more than play.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult race.
The Danishman played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, beating 141⁄2-131⁄2.
 You keep remembering that we were leading largely at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, and at Valderrama, where we won, but fairly  said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to all of the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, to try and win this trophy, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I always said I'd focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's happening on the other side - they're the best players in the world.
Enjoying the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added:  I would never move forward on this point.
Tomorrow is another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that will be presented and things are different.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested to your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message to the players, to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players score better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day upheavals, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing in the final of the 'Miracle of Medina', where Europe took the victory.
 I remember every word , he explained in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the last day.
We have 12 big meetings tomorrow, but you'd like to take this quick start like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it moves in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we try to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
 I've accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course , Bjorn said of his single selections.
The new German warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the  Rheinland-Pfalz , the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the concerns raised after delivery have jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and stealth technologies such as radar signature, infrared and reduced acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
According to Die Zeit, however, the constant delays mean that the warship - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will be obsolete when put into service.
Last year, the damned frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was delivered.
The reasons for this return were little known, but German media mentioned a number of  software and hardware defects  that rendered the warship useless in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, which is half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship appears to be considerably overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the computer system failures, the cost of the project as a whole - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from 2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact short of ships capable of deploying.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time as the old ships were declassified but no replacement ship was designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of bats
New research in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their food search.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the bat's activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable sensors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the bats' cries and the activities of the different species.
A map and a report on the habitats will be drawn up to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territory level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bats have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting the percheries and resulting in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups at the pier and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the property manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a good place here in Threavus for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive. 
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintaining properties, as the unintentional destruction of a single maternal nest could lead to the death of 400 females and young or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said:  We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations at the moment. 
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "false information" and said people want to make themselves known by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a live video posted on Instagram, hours after the allegations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information "false information".
No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today was false information, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine , the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have described as an inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.
Lawyer Christian Schertz claimed that the player would claim compensation for moral damages of an amount proportional to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident was reportedly in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape is alleged to have taken place, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and assured him he was a good guy at 99%, but he didn't know what was happening with the remaining 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital but that she later accepted a friendly settlement because she felt terrified of reprisals and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK  would regret forever  the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
We need a deal, Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
 I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory , said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how crossborder trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers call a supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated in a  strained flow , parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.
 We need an agreement.We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success but also to seize this opportunity , he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
 The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent supply chain set. 
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Unite's union coordinator at the factory and 24 years at Burnaston, said that its members were increasingly concerned:  In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back. 
A government spokesman said:  We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU. 
The White House announced that the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed further
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstructions of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he appeared in the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump has indicated that he would prefer not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders made an appearance on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: 'There is no date set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can postpone it for another week given all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'd love to keep the press informed.
The statement is disputed by some journalists: since 10 September, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to the demagogic reporters on television, although she stated: "I have nothing against them shocking the gallery".
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that  the President participates in more Q&A sessions than any other President before him :  We have checked the figures. 
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to question the President of the United States directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, as you've seen in the last few weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that he gives solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance before the press.
On Brexit fears, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working for the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applying for status for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter:  During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this must be a very troubling time for each of you.
I therefore wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, whatever their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State quarterback Mike Organ, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second baseman, was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
He came to the touchdown and collapsed there, Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a mattress and taking it for another test.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was no further information on the type or extent of the injury and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total playoff appearances on Saturday before being released from the game, bringing his total of the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative schemes
This measure will cancel out the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-payers of UK taxes
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an initiative to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million a year.
Around 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which raises prices and prevents first-time buyers from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many of the country's rich areas - particularly the capital - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing the major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by confiscating land without using it, he urged Mrs May to waive quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the UK's real estate disgrace.
Mr Corbyn has put forward an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rental control and the removal of evictions  without fault .
It also wants to give the councils wider powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said:  Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals outside the UK and for foreign companies to buy a home as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning property has become far away and the misery of the homeless remains too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his ultimate ambition is to become the Scottish national selector at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is pleased to take up the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He rallied the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching the Scotland games in Hampden with my father and that's something I'll never forget.
This opportunity would only arise if I succeeded in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland selectors included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not hesitated to stand behind such iconic names at such a big club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offers.
 For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question  can I bring this club back to the Premier League? 
The structure and infrastructure of the club make it undoubtedly part of the Premier League, he added.
It's not easy to get there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself a success here unless I could get the club back there.
Ross has only had a three-year coaching career, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to promotion from relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren, who were on the verge of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The taking of Alloa was probably a real crossroads, he recalls.
I really thought coaching was better than playing.
It seems strange because I've done well, I've made a good living, and I've enjoyed some great summits.
But sometimes it's hard to play.
There's a lot of detail to be worked out every week.
I still live with that in terms of stress and tension at work, but coaching is fine with me.
I always wanted to be a director, and now I am. I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life.

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat has caused the revenue of the struggling British pubs to rise, but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that pubs and pubs saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultancy, who compiled the data, said:  Permanent sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup led to July following the pattern of June, when bars had risen by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which were hit even more shockingly.
The 1.8% decline in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages are by far the most popular, with more similarities than the restaurants that are declining.
Food advertisements have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% over the month and food fell by 3%. 
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hospitality analysis at RSM, said:  These results follow the trend seen since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in sales in the out-of-home market.
It is no wonder that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a fall in sales of 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food business operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us a well-deserved respite.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the establishment.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's Peach Tracker, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children - some of them as young as 11 - has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of pupils reported having a main account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 - open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a main account that was cleared to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who was inciting others to rape me.
According to a study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have a double profile, with half of pupils admitting to having private accounts.
CSM Head Mike Buchanan said: It is worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online sites where parents and teachers cannot find them. 
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the sport's leaders to draw on his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
 Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that Scotland's athletics would benefit greatly from its participation in the council , said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I'm very eager to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and lead this sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted:  A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a challenging job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and now I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An online advertisement for milkshakes comparing mothers to cows divides opinions
An online advertisement by a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows in the process of trafficking.
To mark the launch of what is now known as the world's first silent milk shooter, Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold music video-inspired commercial to show the freedom its new milk shooter offers nursing women.
In a barn full of grass, four real mothers dance to the beat of a song whose lyrics are: Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see a tail. And in case you didn't notice, it's my breasts, not my breasts.
The refrain continues:  Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women carrying milk. 
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the audience, many of whom say it sheds light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
 A poor decision than using cows to promote this product.
They must become pregnant and give birth to milk like us, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth, wrote the month of their birth.
The Elvie milk thinner is discreetly fitted into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented:  This is a understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who are babysitting?
Someone else added:  Such a disconnected advertisement. 
Others have defended the advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song  hilarious .
I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product, someone wrote.
Someone else commented:  This is a funny ad for moms who take their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows .
This is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet baby-snippets hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk threshing say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milkshake is completely silent, without wires or tubes and silently syses into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go outside while drawing their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented:  The Elvie milk thinner is a product so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk extraction will bring.
This isn't the first time milkshake Elvie has made the front page of the paper.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski as she used this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly settled in a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed in respondents' homes.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that they would compromise their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no legal history.
 Nearly 80% of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people, said Mr Albence.
According to the asylum authorities, in order to deal with the children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear via videoconference rather than in person to plead their case on their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be expelled shortly.
According to the interlocutors and reports submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs of a child's difficulty are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate trauma that many find difficult to cope with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in Syria is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
"Let them leave immediately without condition".
Moualem argued that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions more displaced from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue to wage this holy battle until all Syrian territories were cleared of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for the refugees to return, and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational concerns that discouraged the refugees from returning.
 We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make it easier for these returns , he said.
 They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have announced that there will be no support for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for specific deadlines and expressed hope that military measures would target jihadists, particularly the Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al Qaeda and who will be eliminated.
The UN representative, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers doubtless hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would be arguably the most spectacular final of a presidency!
At this time, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during prime time, is the number one cable television channel.
 It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand , commented Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series  Designated Survivor  which tells of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs Scovell said.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, the Washington scenarios could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen to sit for six hours watching a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used a deep knowledge of his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment full of pride according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions Stormy Daniels gave of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not going to see Super Mario the same way again.
 If some of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night,  said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing teams and daily reversals (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you're behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was just sitting inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
 I remember the time when we were broadcasting all these crazy shows and people were saying: 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization', Mr Fleiss confided.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money invades the tightest midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th District is flooded with money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that allowed two incumbents to run for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban district of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won another seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running for another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is overwhelmingly overlapping the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a clash over campaign funding between the major branches of party finance, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a fairly successful victory last March in a very popular special election in Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District .
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington was not opposed to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only imposed against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the administration's importance to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in peace, without any new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate which were described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next straw could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice for Mr Trump. The public record is now backed by substantial evidence.
Mr Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of whether Mr Trump's campaign was complicit with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If congressional control changes hands, Mr Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, before a jury of his peers.
There are many of them, and I am not saying that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and pushed back the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divisions.
What if Mr. Trump returns the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since the paper reported that last year he proposed secretly registering the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims the Times report is inaccurate.
What will we say if the investigation recently requested from the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confided to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which in the past occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sixty years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy in hand, I can't help but be optimistic about our future.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, but they know that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve feats.
 It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team , commented the 31-year-old striker.
We entered the game thinking we were getting something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European night.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result in their last game, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really hard, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there's a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and win.
Women can no longer sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be treated, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Almost half of the people who took part in the national survey said they discussed the cost of longterm care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
 People want a family member to look after them, but they don't do what it takes to have that conversation , said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
Here's where to start.
Tell your spouse and children that you cannot prepare your family for care unless you tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you to establish a way to pay these expenses.
Your longterm care financing decisions may include a traditional longterm care insurance policy, a redeemable hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your assets - provided you have the means to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the way.
Have a healthcare proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person to check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay your bills if you become disabled.
Think of the little details: Suppose your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written document to be well prepared.
 Not only are the finances at stake, but who are the doctors?, Martin asked.
What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the record is expected to grow.
The communication was blocked and emergency services could not receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, on 26 December, struck the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, triggering a tsunami that swept through 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, and triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook Pidie Jaya's Aceh regency, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Significant earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's detention center and is being held on $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading not guilty, it's certain, when his lawyer was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His partner had claimed he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the casualty toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake was reported just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people - a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crushing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov intentionally murdered all eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could lead to the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required careful preparation and premeditation, prosecutors said, calling Saipov's method odious, cruel and depraved.
 Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco , the intent statement says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York had not called for the death penalty in a court case for 10 years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he was incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the flag of Daesh to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was obviously disappointed with the decision to prosecute.
 We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole can only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,  Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has today pledged to mobilize the People's Army during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should feel pressure from eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham March that the UK would have been liberated already had Mr Farage been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union who joined a lone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay and the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already", he said.
The Member for Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.
He also expressed his opposition to the EU and went on to say: 'We have not fought world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote:  The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false. 
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell the journalists:  I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequer is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, so is our party and our activists who take to the streets and get us elected first.
Quit checking and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. 
 Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
 It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class , he said.
They're trying to trick Brexit and we're telling them today:  We're not going to let you get away with this 
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd:  I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has enabled us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have held conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security concerns regarding the party's application at the start of the conference.
 They are assuring us that they are able to put in place all the IT systems and technology for Canada, plus for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland  he added.
It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future on Saturday at a public meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP's state representative who was co-chairman in 2016 for Trump's Massachusetts campaign.
She's been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th public meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which means having a woman as head of state.
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims of Louisiana State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 AM.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
 Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries , police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's side and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after team guidance allowed him to win the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It soon became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's guidelines would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and rubbed Hamilton on the flanks as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to kick in the turmoil at the tail end of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed the stands one lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while holding his tires to aim for a quick finish and topping Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job of getting a one two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not released the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly cite Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that events in the Senate showed that people were bad, disgusting and dishonest.
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest, he said.
When they see the disclosures and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember ?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you release information-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't disclose anything".
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... no, we have not disclosed information, he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story, Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked me.
But his refusal does not seem to be well received by the President, who commented on Saturday night at the rally:  I will tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the wickedness, the scheming, they don't care who they hurt, who they must crush to get power and control, the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have erased their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by drawing 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants the upper hand.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the stake four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan re-launched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt took over Cownie at 15:16, with a tie.
Dwyer led the Giants before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard again tied with a goal giving a numerical lead at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, ensuring the victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people aboard a plane escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he dies ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Heavy rain continues to ravage the area and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained on the ground to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he felt it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
 The balance sheet would continue to weigh on as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued , said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six metres have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News:  Every minute an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN:  The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military:  I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has gone missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has been reported missing after all 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it had not been able to track down a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in rescuing other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The US airline and Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the officers had panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head wound.
The US Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were related to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution postponed its case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's house while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to get back to its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a racist text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly sent by the mother who complained that she was still a Black woman.
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay in 2016 when she found that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day at work.
"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her blunder, Plasco-Flaxman sent Mrs. Maurice away, explaining that their former nanny, who was African American, had done a bad job and was instead expecting a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for their dismissal and demanding $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was initially employed, but without a contract.
 I want them to understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing , she explained to the Post on Friday, adding  I know it's discrimination .
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to end Mauritius' employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after harming him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists , Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let 's see !
Assuming the trial was a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you prosecute someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do, the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear, a new letter unveils
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter:  It is difficult to put yourself in someone's shoes who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work.
She describes Paddington as a very important member of our family, and adds that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
"He was a very calm man, and he wasn't a boastful one", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something: you're proud of him, even if it's not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
 Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we did not expect it to come out, commented Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly running out of his system.
She died a while ago and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold out.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not worrying about the trials she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I was bowed down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning place postcards to prevent suicide on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted on a Welsh bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
 I don't want any family to feel what I am forced to feel every day  she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile illuminated any room.
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was reunited with his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said: 'I am constantly concerned that there will be a training effect.
Mrs. Davis created the maps to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't keep silent - you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
 He didn't say he was down, depressed or anything else , she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have any eye contact with them or anything.
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: it is heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
 I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we might be able to bring some unity , Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee might collapse  into a partisan stalemate.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections will be held in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him with his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to split the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Defectors falling under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that there were 1 127 desertions last year, up from 2 706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the negotiations on denuclearization, which had been pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of not making any progress since then.
 In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm , Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi, the parliamentary minority leader, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her hysterically, Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and choked when talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations of grotesque and coordinated murder by liberals disillusioned that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was against the Democrats.
 I think he is discrediting himself with these statements and the way he is taking it on the Clintons and Democrats, she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
 If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he's also unfit to sit on the court where he's currently sitting , Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
 This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we are saying: 'Isn't this wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women should serve.
It is a rightful proverb, months and years of wrath overflowing; it cannot go forth without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, do you?
I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried:
I'm angry with you.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as an exultation from anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my first job in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying in an unspoken rage, was being grabbed by an old woman - a cold manager who was still a little terrified - and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They are sad because of you and rejoice because you have come to them.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado House of Representatives, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she laughed, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they lacked was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was very advanced, she was late in raising funds, and so she vowed not to participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually give 1,000 dollars to men were only going to give her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she asked herself.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt dizzy.
 You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown , Mrs Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember my mom asking me what they were gonna put on my gravestone.
"She cried" ?
How the trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The first few lines of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs on items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China is committed to equalizing the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push back Washington is to yield to demands, but to yield publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
 The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than what observers previously acknowledged , said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is prepared  for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
 Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism , he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5 points mark to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, sank his start in the water at the 16th hole in the par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's least-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, has slumped 2-1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it, Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow American John Ram who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment where we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Thomas's got a hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to lean.
We've been overtaken.
Red tide information point: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The very latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decline in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - leading to fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are some islets about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations in deep Sarasota County or off, average concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in Lee County and off, high concentrations deep or off in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
