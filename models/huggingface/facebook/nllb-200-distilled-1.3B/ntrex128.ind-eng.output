Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are worried they'll look like muppets.
There was concern among some AMs at a suggestion that their designation should be changed to MWPs (Members of Welsh Parliament).
This was due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that it could invite ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned, The title is synonymous with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One assemblyman (AM) said that his group as a whole, felt "not happy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open minded" about the name change, but judged that it was a misrepresentation of the MWP abbreviation to the Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AMs is of course a matter for the members themselves.
A 2017 Welsh Government decision gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to have gained wide support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of the AMs, the Commission favoured WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support in the public consultation.
The AMs appeared to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be dizzying for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill for the change within weeks.
The reform bill would include other changes to the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for the AMs and the drafting of a committee system.
The AMs will get the final say on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor shows recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was the price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's did not ring when the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
Historically, the parents I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner, says Mr. Adam
Today, there is none.
He said that the disappearance of all those bars was understandable.
People are socializing in a different way now, he says.
The bar is no longer a neighborhood community living room where people visit regularly.
Like the church, he was worried that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders hoped, and that sooner or later they would be back to square one.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos filled with people who would not help maintain the remaining holy places around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white", he said, "and therefore it will hasten the day when these churches close at the same time because it is unlikely that people who move into these condominiums will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregants before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in in the 1930's.
The black congregation that had been meeting in the area had taken over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they built a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's proudly called the tower's bell the "Poor Man's Bell".
An expert who rang the bell in July gave it another name: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated architectural and contractor story, some led by lay church leaders, and others led by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to charge fees to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old in a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived to catch lobster in California during the opening event of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy cry for help and then rowed in a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill after catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I'm bitten!"
I was bitten!
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he realized it when he reached for the child.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Guard Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their tower-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homewares products decline, larger beauty stalls will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
Investments in beauty became a hotbed for supermarkets to use shelves that had been used to display TVs, microwaves, and appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands ranging from LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also get more space with branded areas like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup line so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly - something increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying everyday necessities in small quantities at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to entice people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that stalls will increasingly look like malls as supermarket chains try to fight back against oppressors like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food service.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since they bought both franchises two years ago, which it says has supported the sale of everyday groceries and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from the chemist's shop in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, for £125 million, three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, the enticing environment and convenient location signify that we are now an enticing destination that challenges the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is appalled after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones leaves "in a rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of an £11m lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage their brand of household appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used her Instagram account to announce that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Petes Jones angry by withdrawing at the last minute, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "grumpy" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their household appliance and accessories brand, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source says: "Truly is by far Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to step down has taken everyone involved by surprise.
No one could believe what happened that Tuesday, so close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is one of Britain's most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to huge investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship".
We talked seriously and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some considered "unpresidential" and had been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice "newsreader" of his.
I'm not giving up anything.
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by Trump as a step forward for North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "appropriate" response from the United States to the initial North Korean disarmament move.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech sequence.
"We're doing the best we can with North Korea", he said.
If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will surely die.
Now we have this amazing relationship,
He said his success in repairing relations with Kim had brought positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unorthodox approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd rather have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, there is no national disaster declaration, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain if foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that Indonesian officials are reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies are allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the ongoing earthquakes Indonesia is experiencing, the country is still very unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the danger warnings, has likely contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia's broken infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has spent money on building roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has hampered Mr. Joko's rule as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Muslim and Christian mobs fought in the streets, using axes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards outside Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He places the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far post.
The ball bounces high above the goal as the ball bounces into the right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just try to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come in and take a chance and not think about it too much, and just kick.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the play, before turning near the midfield and running fast into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic was quick to pass and run in the middle.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opposing defender and kick the ball into the corner of the goal with a left-footed kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered 20-foot waves, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7.55am with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I ask anyone who is in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might be recording something on the dash cam to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman have come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as the police have said, they are in the process of informing the next of kin of the victim.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he found out what was going on.
At this time residents are being told it will take several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer is heard telling someone that the entire area is now being declared a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "this is terrible".
At 2pm two police vans were in the queue and the other one was outside.
A number of officers stand in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by dialing log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament became the last memorial to be subjected to a "historical rewrite"
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban-era destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's people dismissed Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the destruction of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong offspring of Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course royal.
Whether it was a fully accurate representation is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of nations, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure who represented one side of that difference.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Killer pigs torture Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his birth name Yuan, was found dead with a severed, blood-soaked artery near a pigsty in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with a vaccine at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, her cousins found her dead, and saw the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic investigations confirmed that the 550-pound male pig had tortured the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's balls are bloody and broken", said the cousin known as Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pigs had been locked up to prevent them from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the smell of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're biters, very curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect, he says
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, beginning at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the trough began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create heavy rainfall that will spread over the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible desert landslides.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flash floods are likely to occur with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the nature of the tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to explore the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn the gorge into a violent river and storms will bring local gusty winds and dust.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and roads to slip.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some dramatic temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There's a prime example of a dramatic temperature difference across the central US on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will build up and re-spread.
Most of the central and eastern US is expected to warm up starting in October with rates spreading in the 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is expected to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-early October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's stirring statement by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming to report on Friday's last-minute unexpected event: a deal engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was touching her body in a drunken state and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There were probably over 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday, had watched it.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Countdowns for other networks that air this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually had trouble counting the number of people who watched it in the office.
To put this into perspective, that's an audience that's almost equal to a football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly favored Kavanaugh's appointment, topped all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The crowd stayed high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would vote to support Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood up for a few minutes when he was taunted, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think that he told the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when there are many women who are powerless".
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he needed to say at the committee meeting.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to the Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests over her plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that proposals about Britain and the EU having to collect tariffs on each other were "completely absurd".
Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said that he confessed to having shot Wayde to death.
His contract was set at $350,000, the Attorney reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that penetrated the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the surrounding community for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked county law enforcement for their "persistence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
The 6-foot-6 resident lives in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 and he bounced to 2.6 in games last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased at the crater and it registered 183 gas and ash emissions in just over 24 hours.
The center is monitoring several roar and vibration patterns.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of a car in a neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and when thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by riot police threw eggs at them and sprayed powdered paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
A fight ensued later that day with police using their batons to control the fight.
For hours pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of union protesters chanting, "Life to Spain".
Fourteen people were receiving treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters favored independence, although the turnout was low with those opposed to secession and largely boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at TPS across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups have been camping out all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for the joy of being able to choose, but now we are stuck", she said.
Despite achieving a vital, if narrow, victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with her cell phone in support of the police, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed since late last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car?
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
Menga's goal had given Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of Ibrox, for their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of the difference when Gary Holt's side moves are on par with the second-placed Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and face the leader Hearts who are eight points ahead of them next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their division's undefeated record to six games, while head coach Holt is still reeling from a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a reckless away team.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy giving the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made his breakthrough but his attempt missed across the front of the net, then Alan Lithgow was only able to widen his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's header from across the net.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play ahead early, knowing that they could make it difficult for the newcomers over a dead ball.
And that's how you make a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got his chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got his turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the controls but realized that the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was overall undisturbed,
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to elicit a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was tackled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was ruled out for a long time by another Livingston game tactic.
The attack kept coming into Livingston's goal and was consistently avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
The phenomenal from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they're extraordinary, continually exceeding expectations on this ever-increasing track.
Their playing style and personnel have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less than good - they could only break the home side formation once - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their presence in midfield.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open the new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved to the surrounding area to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The resistance protests depicted the existence of a dispute over the existence of an immigrant who was hailed as a hero by some German Turkish residents and reviled as a dictator by others.
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, on the southeastern side of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan Police say officers are working to identify the man and notify his family.
Roads were closed and bus lanes were diverted and motorcyclists were told to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the sheriff's office said.
The chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado Officers have been deployed to deal with the riot, which involved eight inmates and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: Specially trained parole officers have been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not condone violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which a beat-up officer was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods.
Tropical depressions hitting Arizona are rare, but they are most likely to occur early next week as the remaining trail of Storm Rosa's energy through the southwestern desert poses a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that there have only been ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest Storm Center Predictor is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are most likely to be affected 1 to 2 inches, with a possible number of isolates reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flood-free area, the pink rain may be a blessing because the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. National Drought Observatory, only about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land across Baja California Peninsula in Mexico
Rosa, still at storm strength Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakened in strength.
As a result, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
Total 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern Sonoran region, possibly rising to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then cross northward along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by midnight Tuesday.
The main risk that Rosa or its remnants may pose is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwest region of Sonora, and the U.S. desert southwest region of the U.S. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) states.
The rains are expected to threaten flash floods and building debris that drain into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers are calling on anyone who may have video footage of the incident on their cell phones to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "receives hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject a cruel and shameful Democratic investigation", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from the Democrats during the nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reinforce the most perfect legal mind of our time, a juror with a record of true public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually racing, he said.
That's why I went out there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first Senate-level voting procedure on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be in place by Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away when a giant wave hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave washed up on the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rush to flee so they became victims, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, timber, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by BNPB show many destroyed buildings and shops, a bent and collapsed bridge and a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Bureau of Technological Research and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive quake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of the tsunami, so to speak.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication is completely paralyzed with the absence of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers are heading to the disaster-affected area.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be worse", he said.
The agency on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that a tsunami was coming to Palu, even though authorities said that the wave had already hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building being heard screaming panic warnings of an approaching tsunami, toward people in the streets below.
Within minutes, a swell of water washed up on the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami are the biggest cause of the power outages that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has reopened only to allow relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to over 800.
That was awful.
By the time World Vision workers from Donggala had made it safely to the city of Palu, where they were sheltering in a tarp tent built in their office yard, they had passed through a number of rough terrain, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
That was terrible.
Even as relief groups began moving slowly to begin disaster relief, some of them complained of the restriction on skilled foreign volunteers who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, aid and labor can only be started if the disaster area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
At a time when the government is saying, OK, this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but there is no status yet.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of the miracle that will unravel the bleak story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national para-swimming team, has been coaching two missing para-swimmers, who were attending the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", she said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how after news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel spread around the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were part of the celebration on the beach.
All of his messages, however, only get one gray check mark, instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the message didn't get through", he said.
Robber took $26,750 during an ATM charge in Newport on Levee.
A robbery on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM storage box in Newport, based on a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was working, another man ran from behind a Brink's worker and stole a bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to reports, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about their identities can contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
"I believe ye is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with Radio broadcaster Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, the name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means the one, to Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we really are.
He's one of a handful of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also made it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, vows not to use the military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, as the left-wing student movement took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who are attending college and opening more free universities.
He says that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding it will spend on research in the field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even as the U.S. as a whole lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: aim to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling AI research funding is a good start, given that all other countries tend to lag far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview on Sunday.
Lea, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat America's best Othello player, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when the next activity would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government prizes, Lee says.
"It's not China that takes academic leadership; it's the corporate", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university people for AI research for the past few years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think a green card could be offered automatically to the holder of a PhD in AI", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic assignments is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. the Defense Department developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, DARPA recently invested over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would settle a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned its membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two sides of the government reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonia's ethnic Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the result could reach the minimum 50 percent required to declare the election results valid.
The question on the ballot reads: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting a deal with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a worthy price to pay for gaining entry into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the states born of the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough lawmakers said they would abide by the vote's results to make a decision.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations as of 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to give my vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots for the general election in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We agree to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with dignity, not through the door of a servant", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the population will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our people support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said the results of the "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma Macedonia TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For that vote to succeed, it would take 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the first policy rejection of a pro-Western government since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scouring the entire defence of Brighton to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his 65th-minute score.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass early in the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before desperately entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-skinned men.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the Brighton goal-line.
Then he passes to his left, to Sterling.
The English midfielder used his first kick from the goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero receives the ball, deep inside Brighton's territory at the game.
He passes the ball with a stunning long kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a little punch before leading Sterling to the far post.
Sky Blue's forward midfielder drives the ball towards the goal just before it slips out of the boundary.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to sue spoiler versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there's no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer, who is too competitive, hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies in Sunday's game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least have earned a spot after winning the wild-card game against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still looking to clinch their first division title.
Even if we play without winning, at least we get to know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams that will be competing at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under the circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th game, held a practice session on Thursday and started Sunday's game which was usually used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president was implicitly referring to the situation involving his choice Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "You see a very, very, very bad radical Democratic group, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take back power by any means, you see their evil, their abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to protect to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "defeat and block".
"And you've seen that for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and vile and untrustworthy".
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which was greeted with a loud scolding from her audience.
Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I was waiting for it - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a public service.
Now it's intolerant of anyone who expresses their opinion
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to denounce me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was among the last of the Members of Parliament to be told that our presence was not expected - all because we were expressing our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was a vocal defender of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the issues are ironically the same as those that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to his predecessor.
The notice for the Nottingham east workers' meeting on Friday stated that we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.
For almost eight years I was a local Labour MP, the General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises of a "better, friendlier" politics has not been long forgotten, if it ever began.
Differences of opinion within the Labour Party are increasingly clearly intolerable and every opinion is judged on its merits by the party authority.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who I thought would share my political views, began to expect me to turn around and accept a position that I would never have accepted before - either in national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak out - and no matter what I say - it's followed by a flurry of criticism on social media calling for the resignation, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn't be running for Labour.
And it's not just me who's going through it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never escape.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been deemed normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on the larger church and with every motion of "disbelief" or change the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to keep my head down, not to express too much, and then I'll say, "Okay".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect of my comprehensive school classroom, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most - both as a local councillor and a government minister.
I have never hidden my political activities, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East will question my policy positions and the things I don't approve of in the current leadership.
To those who are advocating a motion on Friday, what I can say is that as the country moves rapidly towards a brexit, it will harm our country's business and our public services, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a Labour member or not, I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or any political policy will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr rises to the top spot
The last two attempts may have slightly skewed the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win Tennent's premiership game which was very entertaining today.
Now they're in the top ten, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to score the best chances, is what gives the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel happy.
"So far we have tested our game, and we are still unbeaten so we feel happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we are".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given in that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to score and Jason Baggot snapped an unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in the middle of the half, he scored then made a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the odds to five points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, was ejected, and since the start of the match Ayr has been outpacing Stafford McDowall's test effort, replaced by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard press.
The hosts had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for cornering Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson had arrived behind the injured Ayr forward.
Climo was substituted, as was happening again, almost from the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe kicked a goal and foiled the fifth attempt of the passer Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star looks set to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks set to shift gears into the catering industry after it was previously revealed that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
He stars 56-year-old Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he directed and also starred in alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series is the final episode, and apparently Kiernan plans to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the burgeoning restaurant business in Glasgow.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters located in La Paz.
The public buildings hoist a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Titicaca to the Amazon is polished with the slogan: The sea is our rightful property.
To rise again is an obligation.
Across Bolivia, surrounded by land, memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid - as is the desire to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course positive expectations about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ trial on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's demand that - after decades of tense negotiations - Chile be obliged to negotiate guarantees of Bolivia's sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also had plenty of support at Monday's hearing.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes - and that would only change slightly if it could.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to hand over Chilean territory, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ ruling came just six months after the final arguments had been heard, indicating the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And far from continuing Bolivia's claims, in the last four years it may actually have taken a backseat.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now", he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will still be negotiating, but it will be very difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian government's representative in The Hague rejected the idea of a quick decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - used maritime issues as a political prop.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The trial is an opportunity to see if we need to settle the past.
North Korea says denuclearization will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said first of all his country will never disarm if Korea cannot trust Washington.
Ri made the statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States implementing an agreement made during a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks set to resume nuclear diplomacy that has stalled for more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just a "sham dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and refusal to declare a Korean War settlement would make North Korea surrender.
Washington was wary of approving the declaration without Pyongyang making any effort to curb the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about recognizing the arsenal as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show showcases a huge collection of the latest headgear all the way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or really want to get some sun protection, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the stage of a stunningly stylish fashion show held at Paris Fashion Week.
Completely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have already been showcasing their eye-catching creations on stage.
Valentino's signature feature is a cream-colored hat adorned with a wide brim that covers the model's head.
The large-sized accessories included a diamond-encrusted watermelon, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a collection of weird-and-just masks just before Halloween.
Many masks of various colors with sewn lips that look more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembles scuba diving gear equipped with snorkels and goggles, while the other looks like melted ice cream.
And if you keep browsing through those huge fashion collections - then you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the collection of giant hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
Oversized hats became a big seller in La Bomba, straw hats with a two-legged width seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the label behind the very impractical hat the splash of social media made a huge creation on the catwalks - beach bags of straw that were almost the size of a swimsuit - worn by models in shorts.
A burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia on the edge with a white leather strap, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairstylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main street for next summer - as designers are already making a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens.
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding test scores, which are further reinforced by individual students and collective success in sport, the arts, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as global citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement school curricula according to expectations, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your words will go to his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the most recent test results this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league table for the highest graduation rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received A+ marks.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today languages, as a subject choice, are held to the same standard as STEM subjects in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Department for Work and Skills found that of the reasons employers struggle to fill jobs, 17 percent are due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly being encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With the increasing number of job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are important in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefits of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of foreign countries will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French is the only language spoken in the double-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today's children is so important right now.
Having multilingual skills, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, which is 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in a private school, with a teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
There's no denying that today, in a global business environment, language will always be a crucial aspect in determining the future of a country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and advantages to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire. It is the right thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play only a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do a pre-season game to prepare", he said.
Schedule of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicked off a busy campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at several fun spots that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
Having confirmed that the vote was postponed so that he could choose a Supreme Court fill-in, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
A public meeting of Trump's in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address a hearing this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has grown tense after sexual misconduct allegations and a projected Senate vote will be delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main agenda of this rally is to help the Republican Party gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that five rallies next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to states as much as possible as we face a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally is expected to feature supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate who is trailing in the polls.
"It does not bode well for Morrisey that the president should come in an attempt to improve his polling", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage to hold their hopes in the face of Sunday's single-game
After three one-sided sessions, a foursome session Saturday afternoon is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum pendulum swing is a concept of sport that is a result of a discovery that the players fully trust, and nothing exceeds in competitions like this.
Where do they think the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead before and now they're four, so I think we're taking that as a bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he passed the day.
Europe obviously has the advantage of having a four-point lead with 12 games to go.
But Team USA, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of momentum and they had a lot of things to be excited about, not least the Spieth and Justin Thomas lineup that played together all day and each boasted three of four points.
Spieth has played deadly from the tee area to the green area and led by example.
The cheers of celebration that the boat was making grew louder as her turn came, making a crucial putt to make the game a draw as she and Thomas lost two to two.
His putt that won them at number 15 was greeted with similar shouts, shouts that told you he was convinced America was not losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but attractive pair from Europe is four for four and can do without error.
"Moliwood" is the only couple not to make a bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they also dodged a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both into and out of this tumultuous crowd convinced them that they were the players to beat on Sunday, and no more famous players than Fleetwood or Molinari would lock in the potential for a European victory as the sun set over Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine is like digging a hole that these Spanish and Swedish golfers will never be able to climb.
Although, on Sundays no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and led well into the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has the guts to compete despite the doubts of some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be taking advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after bouncing back from Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
European Thomas Bjorn, looking to defend a trophy he missed at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team who missed a goal in the morning's fourball, making the score 3-1.
The United States provided more resistance in foursomes, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to beat the pitching Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who pushed through two games on Saturday, was occasionally brilliant but he had lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning's fourball, then returned to pair up with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and three respectively.
Europe did not reach it alone despite a bright, windy day in southwest Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a thrilling 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to enter a single game, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed a point draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack looked like it would overtake them.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the UN that sanctions have continued to deepen their distrust of the United States and that it is unlikely that the country will unilaterally strip its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps that show goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally".
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization where North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, he made a significant statement that they did not reject it outright as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between US presidential officials and North Korean leaders held in Singapore on June 12, at which point Kim promised to work for "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korean security guarantees.
North Korea had wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls for a relaxation of heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure by imposing semi-forcible sanctions to achieve their goals, and even rejects 'the declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion to those who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that such continuing sanctions will only deepen our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by US leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problematic party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not come to such a dead end".
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when she spoke to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN summit, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea completely, lavished praise on Kim for his courageous move to denuclearize, but the big job remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the move.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and must not fail until we know that denuclearisation is complete, final and verified".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had actually been made, only North Korea within hours admitted that he was making "gangster-like claims".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile sites as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action".
He stated that Kim's asking him to "take action" in line with his wishes was a security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all first-year students there to sleep more, in an effort to counter the macho culture of learning that is developing through caffeinated owl man.
One academic found that students at the world's top universities often have no idea when it comes to the very basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'Finally a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I only being told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, which launched for the first time this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of a dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sweatpants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were told how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this won't change students' behaviour instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,' adds Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride in being 'late at night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough, good-quality sleep should be your 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, since lack of sleep triggers the brain to activate starvation mode, causing a persistent hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is for all graduate students to be instructed to complete a similar program of study before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students consider setting a bedtime alarm, as well as a wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its regular patterns and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal to lower Gerrard's team's morale
Once again, the Rangers felt the sadness of a day away as Dolly Menga's attack delivered Steven Gerrard's team to a scoreless 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side had just handed Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind league leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers' mindless players didn't seem to be making up.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, just a goal behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble at the Rangers' camp after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt goes with the same Livi 11 that took a point off Hearts last week and he'll be happy with a costume that dazzles their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have scored within two minutes when the first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled the big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick went to captain Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have gotten a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed just two shots in the first half but previous Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovie Ejaria's easy-twin attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep-death-ball tactic.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the substitution almost had an immediate impact as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly played impressively quickly out of the lineup to guard.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team should have extended their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to drive Jacobs out before Lithgow receded wide from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face away.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now from the pages of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it will continue to grow... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device being called the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the less-convincing-looking cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the atomic effect that is released by radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "Tell me, it's going to show up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "recognize" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'recognize' malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
His method involves the process of extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab
They can then identify a protein that's common in many cancers and then inject it again.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, lost her ovarian cancer in over 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" a protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts a pro-Trump rant, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not working.
Kanye West was mocked in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would run in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, titled Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America a long time", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a comedy starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding a sexual assault claim made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the footage of West's teasing was posted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if the Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having difficulty backstage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They're throwing me backstage.
They say, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're dropping me!
And then they said I was drowning", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see where it sinks?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's cloak, because that means you can't dictate what I do.
Try to love".
His comments generated at least two laughs from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person saying: "The whole studio is silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the ex-boyfriend of rapper Mac Miller who recently passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of I Love It, dressed as Bottle Perrier.
West was backed by the chair of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE PEOPLE".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being herself and it's really great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and spews an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was given the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changing his name to the symbol and later artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
Defendants are expected to appear before the Belfast County Court on Monday.
These charges will be reviewed by the DA.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is criticizing toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swings in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, refutes the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such screen roles often make teenage boys feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes 'something is wrong' and questions how to deal with the bad masculinity issues in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where are we wrong in this matter of masculinity?' he said.
'What are we teaching the boys growing up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is character from birth and what is it taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because clearly something is wrong with the young.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be starring in the prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, saying that he was 'done with the battlefield and the horses'.
From November Kit will star in Sam Shepard's return to True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting his wife Rose to be the best reason to leave Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life began' he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, Kit's love interest to Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% spike in the number of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from previous cases.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many disease-transmitting diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff leaked the GOP senator's data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had forwarded the personal information of three United States Republican senators to the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party maintains that the claims were driven by experts and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released included the home address and phone numbers of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, sent by unidentified persons on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the shipment was connected to Waters' office and revealed information from one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and misleading allegations - are not responsible for this leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and is a complete lie".
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This protest is anger", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't stray.
They must not question the motive of the accuser.
They must be calm and peaceful".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to displace Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Water said her office had alerted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and harmful to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of the less-than-good spy Rowan Atkinson
Now looking for Brexit significance in every new film with a biased view of Britain has become a tradition and that seems to be true for the re-emergence of the Johnny English comedy-parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcastic sarcasm about how obviously bad we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, that blink-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up for a second time - his name hinting more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for the non-English-speaking cinematic region.
He was obviously a crazed secret agent who, despite his strange suspicions, had a bit of Clouseau character, a bit of Mr Bean character and a bit of a traveller who contributed a little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, he was based on the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, leaving a mess behind.
There was one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and a rotor propeller quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but his humor feels under-powered and too bizarre, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible have been confident to include comedy as an ingredient.
His humor felt more like it was aimed at children than adults, and to me the odd Johnny English misadventures were not innovative and focused on the jokes of the Atkinson silent movies in the Bean persona.
The premise that's been hot for years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has broken into a top-secret British spy web network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the agents on duty - unfortunately only a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, whose political popularity had been totally destroyed: Emma Thompson played a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much could be worked out of the script.
His wise counselors informed him that since every active spy had been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as principal in some fancy building, but giving secret lessons on how to perform undercover operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers spy academies like School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with his long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, courting a submarine commander, a boring upper-class woman role where Vicki Pepperdine is kind of out of the picture.
So Batman and Robin who had offended His Majesty's Secret Agent are back in action, meeting the mysterious beauty Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is anxiously falling under the influence of a charismatic tech millionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their own ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they burn down a French fast-food restaurant; they create a mess by sneaking onto Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops are obviously pulled for the final sequence, but with such hospitality and buzz, there are few kids' TV channels that have anything to say about it.
It's a moderate thing.
And like every other Johnny English movie, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matched her talent?
Protesting workers are devising a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but get paid five
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would have British people work four days a week - but get paid five.
The union reportedly wants the company owners to pass on the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra days off.
He will let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the state to support workers.
The move to a four-day week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A senior trade union source told The Sunday Times: 'A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four days a week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the whole of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell says he's determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "notaries" at the utility company.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in the drinking water company may not get their shares back in full because the Labour government may make 'reductions' on the grounds of perceived infringement.
He also confirmed his plan to put workers on company boards and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the private sector company's equity to employees, who would pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Seems Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, the accusation came up, and I said, 'You did it?'
He was a man of determination, determination, determination".
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
"My mind has made up its mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is: Brett denied it loudly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he named couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a string of stars performing in a highly impressive, memorable mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been over the last 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving away free concerts a good way to get people to take action, or is it just another case of clicktivism - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging them to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channeled or funded.
The group estimates that safe haven funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in the FAQ on their website that asks "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for naval assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia's involvement in Syria - specifically, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade them, to ensure that their energy cannot get to the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking before an audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared the approach Washington took in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, to use and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as one of "the experts in that field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as Trump administration representatives are on a mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 oil refinery pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the existing capacity of the refinery's 110 billion cubic meters of pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a big problem if a third country interfered with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look into the situation" when she runs for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look into the situation" when running for president after the midterm elections.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women at the top", she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will review the situation when I run for president".
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when campaigning at city hall, saying that he was "taking this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said senators should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent in favor of a possible run and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with their possible run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make the official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during the campaign of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son went through, what he's going to go through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are also feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered", he told an audience attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and told of her son and other war veterans, "They came back a little different, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with one count of domestic violence against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting a challenge to the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who is a brutal gang member", had harassed him, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as countries with major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy runs counter to a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such a prohibition violates principle", the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The prosecution further briefly opined that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered an immigration judge to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home countries because of persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in the policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are in a sad state in Palu as casualties double as the race to find survivors continues
For those who survived, the situation was even more dire.
"It was very stressful", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her feverish baby boy in a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes bringing a body.
Clean water is very scarce".
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up submerged items, trying to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5-magnitude quake was devastating.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
Tears well up as he recounts his feelings as the quake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"Not enough time to save yourself.
I feel like I'm stuck in the rubble of the wall", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then she stopped.
I don't know her condition and my son.
I hope they survive".
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily calling for mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which marked what US officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war, which has led them to raise the level of each other's import tariffs.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles that intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting a tradition of free speech and press freedom so cherished in America by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstands of street newspapers here in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media outlets in China refused an offer to publish" his article, though he did not name which newspaper.
Analysts warn the Republican Party is alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster.
As many key figures in the Republican Party stand up and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotion over the issue is high, and most Republicans on record have already indicated they want to advance on the vote.
It cannot be prevented", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push to conduct an FBI investigation will be enough to quell anger in the electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is near!" as they demonstrated in the Senate aisle as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to move forward on Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy would be off the list", non-partisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's pretty high; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they don't like the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual abuse of her by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts advised there would be a backlash that followed if Republicans kept pushing her to advance with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about committee selection or final voting or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they handle it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news outlet.
However, the American people seem to be divided over who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the choice slightly more in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believe or may believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, had assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court nominee showed her pussy to him when they attended a party while they were both at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that was trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to start now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this online private data storage is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In the corporate world, it's known as "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, was for the company to provide the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted staff developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all their business models are really going to be turned upside down overnight.
"We didn't ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide the energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the time of launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 scholar Victoria Cross
The only Church clergyman in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog under a barrage of field and machine-gun fire".
He then rushed forward to the battle line and with "great courage" led the front line before rushing to the field alone and disabling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's action was "something I knew I would never live through but was a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very flattered to be part of this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that will be given by many".
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they get Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching a crowded Bellator 206 only to be turned away from the main show.
The San Jose Bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when his coverage turned to Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after staying up late on the day of the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke".
"It is a government policy, that at 6am the content is not suitable for airing, so it is replaced with children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would improve their scheduling to take into account UK audiences in the future.
"I think if we think about replay, I think we might be able to get it done", Coker said.
"But it's now six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
And trust me, in the transition, there's a lot of texting going back and forth and it's not all educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical glitch.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to just five fights out of six fights -- as we normally do -- and we're going to try to avoid over-watching for the fans, and we're doing it.
This is an unfavorable circumstance".
Tom Daley feels "humiliated" about his sexuality issues.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality problems - but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gays' right to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the outcast on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" all the other people she grew up with because "it's not socially acceptable to like both men and women".
He says: "To this day, the feelings of inferiority, the feelings of being different, have become real things that give me strength and strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so that she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to stop discriminating against gays.
He said he spoke because he felt fortunate to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion says falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, and she says the age gap is not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it's very hard to find someone of her own age going through the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it was all about 'I should have won the gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'You won't sit in the front row dad,'" she said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until he died, finally admitting that he was invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which has been a fixture with her in her preparation for the Olympics and still makes her cringe.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 show broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles as a reserve for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson was set to set a record on Sunday as he played his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he had to switch roles to avoid an unpleasant accomplishment.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was booked by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and group four game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and playing his game at the range, hoping to fix what has been troubling him.
Never the most straight-forward golfer even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was unsuited to the extremely strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely gave long and rough penalties for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, to face the highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles games with four points under, starts off with a hot start, then Mickelson's game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expresses confidence in this man, not because he can say much else.
"He really understood his role today, patting me on the back and hugging me, and saying he would be ready for the game tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He was so confident.
He's a Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's how it's played and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which will never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson pocketed 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some things to the team that could not be said.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's the cool guy in the team room", she explains.
"I think the younger players are having fun with him, this week too, which is quite fun to watch.
He gave a lot, more than just play".
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn knew that great advantages could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from experience that someone leading big enough toward his final single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be on a rough ride.
The Dane made his first-ever appearance in the 1997 match at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their nose by the thinnest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we got a big lead at Valderrama; we got a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just now", said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching the Class of 2018, win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you're going into a really boring game.
Go out there and do whatever's right.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've said for a long time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world".
Pleased to see the players playing on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would never have gone it alone.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is something different that will be done.
It's great to be out there with a teammate when everything's going well, but when you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer is tested.
That's the message you have to give all the players, bring your best to the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the last day's turn of that big game, having been part of the team that won in Brookline before ending up losing as Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together on the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start them fast like you see in Brookline, like you see in Medina.
When momentum is going one way, it's going to put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up the rosters and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the opposition against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players in the top order.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I thought I could close all the roads", Bjorn said of his single choice.
The new German battleship is delayed again
The German Navy's newest patrol vessel was supposed to have entered service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol vessels, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have hampered the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class patrol vessels.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as radar deactivators, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to use the latest patrol boat for two years away from its home port.
However, the constant delays meant that these advanced warships - which were said to allow Germany to project its power abroad - would be obsolete by the time they entered their service life, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 patrol boat made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
The software flaw was particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class battleships.
It is also known that the ship's weight is so excessive that it will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of producing the entire project - including training the crew - was also a problem.
It is said to have risen surprisingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The problem of the new patrol vessel is particularly important given the recent warnings of a decline in the German naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of ships with the ability to deploy".
The official said that over time the problem is getting worse, as older ships are no longer in use but no replacement ships have been provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol boats could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret life of bats in secret
New research is being done on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and sopran as well as the long-eared brown bat and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a mobile survey using handheld detectors.
An audiologist analyzing all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's calls and which species is doing what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create landscape-scale images detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined sharply in recent centuries.
The bat is threatened by construction and development work that affects its nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper that is hung to trap bats and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because it hunts at night, its ears are more useful than its eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to pinpoint insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has a staff of ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and occasional rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only nature reserve at Threave Plantation in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Plantation manager David Thompson says the plantation is a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good habitats.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we are doing here and at other properties will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of bat inspection before performing maintenance on the property, since there is a possibility that the unconscious destruction of a single litter can kill up to 400 female and juvenile bats, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the general public to join in.
He says: "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still do not know what the fate of their populations is".
Ronaldo, who denied rape allegations, is preparing a lawyer to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him "fake news", and said that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was then alleged to have paid her by giving her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they're saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's a common thing.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed only "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admitted that they both had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had a visa for his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because he felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried "of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now seeking to rescind the peace settlement because she is continually traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the attack was alleged, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "concerning" Toyota, Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker says the impact of a border delay if no deal is reached will be detrimental to Brexit in terms of labour costs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported across the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production shutdown at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini plant in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the carmakers are saying is the supply chain risk if there is no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production lines are run on the principle of "on time" production, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which industry says could cause delays and spare parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, company representatives said, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "properly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"It's proof not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what's already a very well-run supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it was clear in the long run, warning that the cost increase would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately be detrimental in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the plant, says that his members are growing worried: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a proper and sensible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" as the fight for chief justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump aides and Russia, as well as potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been a rumor in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "opt out" of firing Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is appearing on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that postponing it to another week is good also given the other things that happened at the high court.
But we'll see and I always want to keep the press updated".
Some journalists will dispute the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not due to a dislike of TV journalists "who are trying to get attention", though, he said: "I don't agree with the fact that they are trying to get attention".
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president has more direct question and answer sessions than any previous president", he added without citing evidence: "We've seen the numbers".
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump routinely asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show his reasons, making a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before the press gathers.
The health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still be working here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MP sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has committed to meet the costs of applying for permanent status for EU nationals working in the public service who are relocated.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding this withdrawal were still ongoing, nearing the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very upsetting for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers running back Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the end of the game.
"He came to the edge of the field and passed out there", Reed said.
Coach and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him in a crate and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury" and the State of Tennessee is working to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He collected a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total tackles for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan
This move will slow down the pace of success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is estimating it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in Britain - along with extra money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to curb the pace of Jeremy Corbyn's successful efforts to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing and targeting higher incomes.
An increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that will fuel the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional cost - which is an additional cost to current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this movement to rise to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's affluent areas - usually in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people have their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable housing in order to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent controls and ending evictions "without blame".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals not living in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy a home as cheaply as hardworking British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home becomes a distant one, and the mistreatment of the homeless remains a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "main ambition" is to be Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got the B hat and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to come back.
However, the opportunity will come, if I succeed in managing the team".
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he's not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that the club has, there is no doubt that it will be in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there".
Ross's career in team management lasted only three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton, and spending 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and turned St Mirren from relegation to Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be a crossroads I have to cross", he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, I make a decent living, and I enjoy some decent things.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my entire adult life".

Surveys have found that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of pubs in Britain that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Figures show that the pub and bar group saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The scorching sun and longer than expected British participation in the World Cup mean July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue rose by 2.8 percent, barring restaurants that took a hard hit.
The downturn in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June will worsen in July.
Sales of pubs and bars selling drinks so far have performed stronger than those of restaurants in decline.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not as badly as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out for drinks.
Sales at all pubs and bars that sell drinks rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those that sell food down three percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors affecting outdoor market sales.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be very painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer should not come at a time when food vendors are having a bad time, and time will tell whether the reasonably good temperatures we already enjoyed in August will provide some much-needed rest".
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is an undeniable industry benchmark.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they operated a "main" account that had been cleared for parental viewing, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager asking others to "rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's upsetting so many teenagers trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having him on board", says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am acting as a voice for the athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American track and field athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC pundit, is now unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "One month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a daunting task to recover fully, relearn how to walk, and exercise today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad comparing a mother to a cow has caused a rift online
Breast pump companies have divided the online world with an ad comparing a nursing mother to a cow being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a humorous music video to show the freedom this new pump gives a mother to express herself.
Four mothers dancing in a barn full of cow dung to a song that included lyrics like: "Yes, I blush myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, this isn't a pig, this is my breasts".
And then the refrain goes, "Pump out, pump out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, I pump my woman's milk".
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it has caused "an uproar" in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump fits perfectly inside her breast-feeding bra.
Another commentary: "Understandable trauma is good for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who have to babysit?"
Another added: "A meaningless advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breastfeeding.
Blackmail makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'll take it as it is.
This is a product of genius", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who are bullying (often at work or in the bathroom) and who feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel like they're dancing with a pump hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign came from the insight of many women who were blackmailing breastfeeding who said they felt like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes and fits inside a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, carry their babies, and even go outside while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, comments: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched with conviction and provocation.
By equating the image of expressing women with that of a cow we want to pump milk and all its challenges, and show it in a way that is entertaining and fun with the full freedom that the new pump offers.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Sneak Into Tents on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being detained is increasing despite the monthly border crossings still remaining unchanged, in part due to tough statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it harder to sponsor children.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and they're afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save the children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and their data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor abandoned minors.
The agency then determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who sponsor or are members of sponsoring organizations are in the country illegally, and most of them are bad foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting these guys", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process children more quickly, officials introduced a new rule requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previously standard 60 days, shelter workers said.
Most of them appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their legal status cases to an immigration judge.
Those deemed unworthy of assistance will be immediately deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or stressed, resulting in increased violence or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports received by the system in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is growing in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose signs of a struggling child tend to be overlooked, because of its size.
They say that moving children to a camp town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate a trauma that has been so much fought over.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were occupying Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million people fleeing their homes.
He stressed that Damascus will continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" of terrorist groups and "the presence of illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem urged them to return immediately, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading extreme fear" that drives refugees further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They politicize what should be a matter of utter humanity".
The European Union and the United States have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be given to Syria until a political agreement is agreed between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to resume political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target the mujahideen including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be crushed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for a general election.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the provisions of the current Law", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers expect, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
So far, there's no sign of exhaustion for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had topped the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"It's a spirit that draws people in because it's something that's not understood", says Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembers taking a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd give his vote to Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline that emerges from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the global economy restored.
Instead, luxury that only the most privileged audience can experience.
Yet, it's not just being an informed citizen that at six o'clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "background" source for his book entitled "Fear", wearing Paul Manafort's $15,000 camelskin bomber jacket ("thick clothes with conceit", The Washington Post says) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's gruesome description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of the policy he's making is making it look like a reality show that entertains you every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show's stage actors and Trump's daily storyline.

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He's not able to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Supreme Court on his balance sheet.
"I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

A lot of outside money flooding the White House's most intense midterm election race.
It's no coincidence that Pennsylvania 17 is inundated with money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that puts two candidates in contention for the same seat.
The newly redrawn Pittsburg district, nominated by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another major party, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with Pennsylvania's new 17th district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally Republican.
The competition for Pennsylvania's new 17th district has resulted in a large campaign fundraising between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb gained prominence in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts are sending the Democrats a little ahead.
U.S. Considering Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdrawing
Diplomats have confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which had received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and increase unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings were underway, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to resume, in order to effectively end the sentencing process for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the government's importing at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any further reprimand or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations regarding the unclear circumstances.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke of the ambiguous circumstances.
A Study in the Scriptures
Another shocking story is the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which now has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually become a juror for his peers.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's administration is inevitable - or its equivalence in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage to come.
The beginning of history centred along such a tipping point, and the march of democracy was either accelerated or delayed.
Now Americans are facing some of these tipping points.
What are we supposed to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be quietly recorded and argued that he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was false.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is brought before the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote at halftime for Congress to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will deteriorate over time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika on it.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feeling optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept centre-half Graham Dorrans out of the first half of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to bigger hopes.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we were sure we could get something and go away with one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw may be a fair outcome.
In the first half, they might have done better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
As Thursday approaches, tonight will be another big day for Europe.
We hope to bag three points even though it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in their last game, however, with the support of the fans behind us, I am sure we can continue to go forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a difficult time, because of my injury and the changes in the club itself but right now there are very good hopes in this club.
This squad is great and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good practice.
Let us now grow, put the past behind us and achieve success".

Although it turned out that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, not many discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed it with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there is no step to start the discussion", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for care if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get treatment, as your choice will be crucial in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you to show you how to pay for these expenses.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that cover these costs or insure yourself with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Show your legal documents: face a legal argument that is on the horizon.
Identify immediately your health care authority, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are met by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, your financial power of attorney should also be considered.
Someone you trust to take care of all your financial decisions should be the one you choose, in addition to making sure your bills are paid in case you cannot afford them.
Always remember every little detail: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and on his way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man shot with a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a shotgun on his way home from a night party.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when multiple gunshots were fired into his chest, abdomen and hand.
The shooting incident was described by officers as occurring at around 02:30 BST, and was described as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The victim's injuries were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been produced by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
A devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday claimed the lives of at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disruption in communications made it difficult for aid workers to get information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu city that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in South Sulawesi province is fishing and mixed farming, especially on the Donggala coast.
However, nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years:
2004: December 26: Indonesia is hit by a massive earthquake, specifically on the western coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also causes a tsunami in 14 countries, claiming 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the deaths are in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of earthquakes of similar magnitude struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were reported dead.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake also struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high [10 m] tsunami that instantly destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also experiences a shallow earthquake and devastation, as well as panic from people recalling the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
Although there is no tsunami potential this time, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed as a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily overwhelmed thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's stepson arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reports and resisting arrest attempts, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he snatched the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring herself "not guilty, as far as I am sure" when asked about her defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor counts, which could land her in jail for one year and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B criminal charge, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, criminal charges. This isn't the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, which were also related to the incident.
Her boyfriend accused her of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from a veteran group for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 384 people.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake with the potential to trigger a tsunami has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power grids and communications are cut, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the horrors of the disaster went viral on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to cheer on a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, as the tsunami tore through the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare and unprecedented statewide sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed assault by ramming a truck he rented from Home Depot into a pedestrian and cyclist on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a will to impose the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the commission of racketeering, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of assault and attempted motor vehicle destruction.
According to the prosecutor, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation", as Saipov's crimes were depicted as being committed with "abomination, cruelty, and savagery".
It was expressed in the will statement, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last dropped the death penalty.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution in a New York federal court in 1953 was in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse as the days and months passed after the attack.
When questioned by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack was inspired by an ISIS video he watched on his phone, as the charges suggest.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute rather than accept a guilty plea for a life sentence without parole would only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident", Patton explained.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with the prosecutor not to impose the death penalty.
Nigel Farage is in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for a 'move the people's army' today in a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested taking part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter Peter Bone told a street protest in Birmingham that Britain 'should be out' now if Farage were to serve as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenges May faces in reconciling her divided seat have been underlined by Remain Tories supporters who joined separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite the onslaught of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between his package and 'chaos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave crowd in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a colleague to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was still in charge, we'd be out of here by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am ready to stand for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers".
He said, while expressing his opposition to the EU: "We are not fighting a world war to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion could potentially bring about change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the minds of the British people have changed and want the status quo is completely untrue".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also joined the rally, told reporters: 'Simply put, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
Chequers are not popular with the public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with our party and our activists who have really taken to the streets and got us elected in the first place.
Our petition, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said that politicians' demonstrations should be blocked to 'feel the heat' if they want to reverse the 2016 referendum result.
"The most valuable thing at this moment is the trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, assuring them that 'we will not let you do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are preparing to deny Brexit, feel the heat too.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that will win us Brexit and will never give up until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, masses of Remainers moved through Birmingham before holding a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A line of activists appeared to wave the Tories Against Brexit banner after triggering its line this weekend.
His Labour colleague, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group over the issue of security of their party application as the conference opened.
"These are the people who told us that they could take over the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-friction border, in the name of unlimited free trade in Ireland", he added.
What a comedy show.
There is no good Brexit at all,' he added.
Warren is planning to make a "serious fuss" in the presidential race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "cross the presidential line" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's 2016 vice campaign chairman in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he has been branded as Trump's opponent in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with his constituents, held in a city hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to enter the circle of Washington to restore our broken government, and that included the time for women to rise to the top".
The shooter, Sims, the LSU player, is in custody.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced the arrest of a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. ET during a news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man is identified calling for help as seen on the video.
Friday morning, 20-year-old Sims was found shot and killed near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6, Baton Rouge-raised junior, that's the Sims, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team concedes victory over Sebastian Vettel
All became clear when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday which would bring the Mercedes team order to a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton as he held his position in the first two turns and pulled Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to drive into the pits and allow Hamilton to move into the density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after a series of chases that showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the interior empty at the risk of holding on after a double move to hold on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race as he held off a tyre change to aim for a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
The team has done an amazing job of having a one-two", Hamilton said.
That's really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday by insisting she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford regarding sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was happening in the Senate that showed people who were "evil and lewd and dishonest".
"Something can happen and something beautiful is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the angry and evil and lewd and dishonest people", he said.
"When you see the leaks and the leaks and then they say, "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak it".
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak it", he added, to the impression of the senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leaks did not originate from his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill said.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he requested".
But his refusal seemed to be frowned upon by the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president was impressed by the notion that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to seize power in various ways.
You see the crime, the brutality, they don't care who they hurt, they have to march for power and control, Mediaite reports on the president's speech.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won the league
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for their loss on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side to a draw before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized the standings for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and eventually lead to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It's the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three games in the previous game.
The opener from Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a pass by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a tight opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was the passer for Cownie's 15:16 equaliser.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first period when he scored the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The hosts rallied and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time late in the second period and he secured the win with his team in the mid-fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure hundreds of passengers on planes survive earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake hit the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at a rocking guidance tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to stay on to ensure that Batticaloa Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he felt the tower begin to collapse.
He died afterwards in hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation Authority, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper made it to the Hammer.
"We are all saddened to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency made access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The death toll is believed to be on the rise as many bodies are still overwhelmed by rubble and many others are unreachable", said a spokesman for the national disaster agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave that reached six meters had made the bamboo hammer crack that led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing a body.
Clean water is becoming scarce.
Minimarket everywhere is looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing, after earlier reports that 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to locate the man.
The airline was not quick to respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people have been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the complete sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane landed in a lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in at a very low speed.
"That was a good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to get through waist-high water through the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
She delivered the flight attendants in a panic and screamed, and she suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close by the repaired pier also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal a timeline of women burned alive last night.
The arrest charge stems from a case that took place Saturday in the re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the various movements made by the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was in the same location as Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to the defendant's earlier statements, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in the same location as Chambers during that time, he argued that he was then with his friend Michael Sanford, the police eventually asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was out of town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency that Tellis conveyed was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deleted messages, calls and contact information from Chambers's phone.
"He wiped the victim out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge stated he hoped the trial would lead to a jury trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A hip hop trio wanted to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who hail from Bristol, claim the hip hop movement is moving away from the origins of political messages and into tackling social issues.
They wanted to get back to their roots and make the hip-hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through some artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black guy?!
NY nanny sues couple for assault after posting racist message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple refused to be labeled racist, considering it more like "screwing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No more black people", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they fired the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because she had done a lousy job and he expected more from the Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Miss Maurice gets paid for one day's work and then she's sent home using Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding compensation for the couple's dismissal, and he is asking for compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, in compensation for the babysitting work he was originally supposed to do, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that", he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought claims that they were racist, claiming that the worker who fired Maurice was a legitimate thing to do, they were afraid they couldn't trust him after bringing it up,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists, "Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you let your children be cared for by someone you've disowned, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you know".
As wrapped in "burning", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to her baby two months ago and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You'd go after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do, the investment banker added.
While the legal case was still ongoing, the court of public opinion had quickly denounced the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publishers are worried readers won't relate to talking bears, a new paper reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, explained in the letter. It was very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was in, reading it first before it was published.
It's funny to know as we know about Paddington's great success".
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired through writing a children's book with a teddy bear, was very optimistic about his rejected work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bitter sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he added his father was quite proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not arrogant", she said.
"But since Paddington means so much to him, it's like having a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though it's not all your work.
I think that's how he sees Paddington's success.
Although it was a product of his own creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors were unable to save her.
"Nad made the call quietly to convey it was very bad. that he was highly unlikely to survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you in a moment.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly wore off and left his system.
She's been dead for a while now, and the process of handling it all feels lethal.
I can just sit there and wait, realizing all this has been revealed.
I couldn't moan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to put up with all of that".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of what she had been through.
"No one knows", he said.
"My head was bowed and tears were running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That she needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her".
Mourning women post suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and numbers to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone recognized her by her smile.
They always say that her smile lifts the mood".
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
"I have a constant concern about the long-term effects", says Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to let people know that there are other people out there that you can reach out and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and be silent - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
He says that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to get through it: "It left a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in doubt as the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "destroy" the board's decision-making deadlock.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to time.
The legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, they will be very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to sit on the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There's an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has plummeted under Kim
The number of people defecting from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a member of the Sanctions Korea parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most North Korean defectors were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have been very heated in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This follows a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, it is unlikely that we will unilaterally lay down our weapons", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition Party Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally suited to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman performed like that, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and having difficulty speaking when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also outright condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi expressed objection if she would try to sue if she was approved, and if the Democrats gained more votes in the House.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but he's not fit to be on the court where he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential ruling on the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was seen as a conservative justice advocate.
At his inauguration, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for someone hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Wasn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical worm, a rage for months and years, and she couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
She goes on to say, "I was really helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique that means that she's angry and starts crying, she would say to the person who's talking to her, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are shed as an outlet of anger in part because he is basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, was one moment I was crying in inexpressible anger, my neck being grabbed by an older woman - a cold manager who I was always a little afraid of - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful".
Patricia Schroeder, who was a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and resigned from the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he was late in the campaign, he was behind in fundraising, and so he vowed he would not run unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the man $1,000 gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When she spoke to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was too overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - to make it difficult to speak.
"You might think I was too nervous", recalls Miss Schroeder of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"He was crying"?"
How the U.S.-China trade rivalry might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of the trade war between the US and China is so deafening, and while the fight is far from over, the gap between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase came into effect this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US through China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has been pleading to match the US one-on-one, and the world's second largest economy is not going to change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to back down is like following its will, but publicly surrendering to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure of U.S. trade competition could favor China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers have previously known", says Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert institute.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and offers help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to their original state.
All the conditions are now present because of the voluntary return of refugees to countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the sweeping economic decisions that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures the Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the US team by final scores of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered its losses as Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding his loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his round, becoming one of only four players to have ever been 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one Dustin Johnson has lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter who may be playing in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European overall winner with a career-high 25.5 points in the tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I couldn't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have her back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help", Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He handed over his responsibility to fellow American John Ram who defeated legendary US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record Ryder Cup career record.
Strange statistics by one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles under only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There was a moment this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
Respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost the game".
