White pedestrian at f3, black pedestrian at e6, white pedestrian at g4, black woman at h4 - crazy chess!
White: Tower in a1, pedestrian in b6, king in c8. Black: pedestrian in a7 and b7, king in a8, alfiere in b8. The White puts the opponent in the zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, then the Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his alfiere in any other chess on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White advances his pedestrian from b6 to b7 and gives crazy chess. In the second situation, the White tower takes the black pedestrian in a7, with the same result.
