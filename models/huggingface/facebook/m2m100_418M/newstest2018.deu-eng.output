Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
This is a place where young people are to meet today.
A mining chapel, where it is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
The small gardens rely on the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It’s annoying when the maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to be excited, because the car navy showed a green veil instead of a surrounding road.
The historic maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal to the state government, are all other than current – but this is why it is very obvious.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities in the spread area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a flick tape that is not recognized as such.
In the big overview map, more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called Urpositions sheets, were incorporated.
These arose according to the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first measurement of Bavaria.
The owner is Napoleon.
The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographic capture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops eventually with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: It was the present neighbors who created the idea of a large-scale Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph advanced the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich comes from 1856 and is, like all others, available on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier/today is the most impressive in the example of the country’s capital city.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was united 21 years after the map was created, that is, in 1877, as the Munich district.
Today, Diffendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganser road, which was only named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers’ uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: At the Inzoom, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered flow pieces from the so-called "time collection", from which the basic tax was derived.
Today there are no longer farmers — but small gardens of the “Land in the Sun” plant.
A large green area is characterized north by Differential.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October Festival, was in the 19th century actually still a village - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, you read not only the street names "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the Winds" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with foolish ideas.
There was 1858/59 the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" created.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist that is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anketing of the so-called errors.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inhabitants,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the facility.
For 280 patients there was first room, later it was extended to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular railway facility in Hair in 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper Clinic Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrics in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth house with educational facilities.
West is the football square of the TSV Munich East, east houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as the " Main Place", the Kaufingerstraße was named "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs crushed many holes into the city center in December 1944.
One great thing remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mining chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on April 5, 2017 the staircase for the second S-Bahn-Stam Trail will take place.
With the Schieberegler, you can compare the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the state’s racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri passengers to pay special attention when traveling through the state and to be extremely cautious as a series of doubtful, racial-based incidents have occurred and are noted throughout the state in recent times,” the group said in a statement.
A newly adopted Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination attacks, as well as the state’s prosecutor’s authorities that disproportionately target minorities, forced the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of citizens’ rights that people happen.
They’ll be arrested because of their skin color, they’ll be broken down or killed,” said President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, to Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet.”
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also reminds of a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Prosecutor General, in which it shows that black drivers in the state are arrested 75% more frequently than white.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to be ready whether it brings deposit money or let the relatives know that they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which raised the state to the 16th place in the country in terms of the number of such injuries.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to prosecute a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws, obliging local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on the site.
At the Practitioner Court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 milk boys and so many young animals, and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
On the table of the vacation guests are exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementarly important".
I can't make a profit on such rough areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, many things need to be processed with the engine sensor.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," Schwendemann emphasized.
In 2003, he took over the parent’s plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not conduct biological plant.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the leadership promotion."
With a cost of €3,000 to €4,000 per hectare, farmers should be supported.
We hope that this could extend the flooding of the land for a long time.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized because of the promotion.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were received through the wheat promotion.
The opening area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be flooded by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of €71,500, half was funded through leaders, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat.
“The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac said, “You do a really good job, without farmers and farmers you can’t do it.”
Peter Weiß also said, “There are the best foods produced.”
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of wheat cows.
The aim is to open the black forest.
The requirement is the presence of a sponsorship curve called the LPR.
Furthermore, the landing area should not be scatterable (hunting above 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by flooding.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build about 16 kilometers of garden.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
The White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Freedom.
The most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other – therefore the carefully scored fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president’s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration with the freedom statue.
To remain fair, Miller did not hit the statue itself.
A hole of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have shaken him if he had done it.
But he captured their significance, and in particular the significance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller acosta shame: "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom.”
Miller is actually right, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to Lazarus’ exhilarating words, the only in which a state invites not only any ancient immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, thy poor, thy depressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, thy rich coasts’ poor waste.”
There’s never been a time when the “living waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and his friends, who were committed to putting their words on the foundation after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract – she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Cheat for Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is a early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: “Lady Liberty is going forward.
It is intended to carry the facel of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The facel should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Very unusual Limbaugh has met something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the roofs of ships.
It is in the true sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue tells them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.
And that’s, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their faces should not light the way, but light the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.
The performance director of the UK's light athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-hour Scottish contingent in the world championship frame "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "School develops something special in Scotland" and the UK's light athletics must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’re going to keep it up until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it’s something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British light athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
Also with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal winners, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will play against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to be team captain.
“Eilidh is quite modest.
Their Captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.”
The Commonwealth Silver Medal Winner, who will play at its fifth World Championship at the 400-m hinder, says it’s “incredible” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's top total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-range runner Muir leads on this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1500m and the 5000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 meters, is another shooter to be watched after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scott was in the team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she’s “enormously proud” of the fact that many of her peoples are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chosen me makes it something very special for me," she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What does my speech as a captain mean?
I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will just be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t appeal for a public office if you can’t tolerate voter heating
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take a long time until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He was foolish in criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we will be led to the battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union prosecuted him for that at the beginning of this week.
The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as freely, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it is important.
And it’s especially important when it’s a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heating head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who swim the peach online.
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hated crimes.
"I commented generosely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hatred crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the newspaper 'The Post'.
“I don’t appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then some are more likely to ignore it as a so-called collective engagement and not recognize it as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the staff of the governor called a “concentrated spam attack” others would probably call “pre-speech”.
The Facebook age makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in earlier times if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or arrest and silence protesters.
That’s exactly what is happening digital.
Hogan isn’t the first public official to be criticized for scaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is prosecuted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers joined his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to the newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his point of view on the Amity Treaty, Trade and Shipping with the UK overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not keep her silent.
Freedom of speech, discrepancy and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who last year led next side at Archerfield Links to the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place and serves as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we’ve seen how it reached its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from his best side, he’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a generous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, though in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“It really feels special,” said the Southport-host player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Return to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a very special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home ground.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little more when you’re playing at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel that additional pressure.
I really playing again and I played a solid golf.
I’m glad how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking space costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less lung cancer due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, less and less people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) came to this outcome in a study.
"On our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are caused by passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he made his own study on this topic from 1994.
At the time, there were 400 deaths of lung cancer due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Household connections are very complex.
The construction work on the Villinger Street is ongoing and “is somewhat in time,” said the head of the building, Fred Heinze.
In the field of household connections, the situation is more complicated than is supposed, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hindered the construction work, is a big problem for the construction group of the company Stumpp.
“The car drivers’ ignorance of red lamps and brakes is already enormous,” Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were very hard.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cold mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cookes the dinner, she does not use herd.
They rarely use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the quiet Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the cave.
After half an hour, the frozen knolle is taken and drunk with jealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example, washing clothes with dry water from the nearby pump.
A shell in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late working can be dangerous: Most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one will dare to go around in the village after 17:00,” she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was adopted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elderly should vote by a public climbing in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement for independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, whichins control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride with a rental car.
There is no public transportation.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tubes, and of wheels that have been transformed by roast into various yellow-brain tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, but not journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
“We were not used to wearing this dress,” says Degei, indicating her vibrant, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
“In the past we had only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty limit and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also the gold country of Indonesia.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport decreased $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these wealths are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that the powerful Indonesian military preserves a stunning presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times that Freeport paid $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuanese demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated without grace.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass murders in the 1970s were genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We'll lose everything," it is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of crimes of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are popular according to another report - and the brutal collapse of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The scraps have strengthened as Papuas’ resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83% Christian, but the demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning cantins sell baked chicken and Gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to stay here.
“The migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai indigenous who moved to the province capital Jayapura for work.
“It has cost the indigenous Papua – the Mama-Mama of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann saved 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the inhabitants feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai only two months after Jokow's introduction in October suffered a deep point.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs before a warehouse fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the dark.
The scared children told them that they should turn on their lamps.
One of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone and later returned with four soldiers, the local pastor Yavedt Tebai said.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and shot the group with their weapons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers shot into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and the things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 Papua young men, women and children gathered on a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and conducted the Waita dance – running in the circle and imitating a bird sing – from the Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones on police and military positions.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it says in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned, I was suddenly shot into my left arm," he told TIME on the veranda of his colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but says the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was overwhelming, a lot of shootings were shot,” he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was a witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who, as many Indonesians, only carries one name, the TIME in dark mood.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "secure" their station only because it would be attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the murders came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and pledged to deal with the historic misconduct in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won’t happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address historic human rights violations.
The excuses began almost immediately.
“Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to coping with these violations, but there are processes that have to go through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “all is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN for “crimes against humanity” which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody independence referendum of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims addressed such claims with cruel unbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress,” says Yohanes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Jacob repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was hit by the military after he helped burial four of the victims.
“After I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shoot on village in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village inhabitants and the manager of a building company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Rebellion inhabitants protested in front of the company’s office.
Police said the village residents threw stones on officers who responded by shooting warning shots.
But local people say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to the TIME.
“I’ve hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the involving officers to take responsibility and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the peoples Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the Green Highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebellion army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response to this, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of “assurance of national sovereignty.”
Some people never go up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for local people.
Bread is also out of scope.
The people here build up everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato each.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that there are in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run their own competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there’s no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Additionally, restrictions on reporting on international media remain stressed.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, despite the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the vice-Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokow's election campaign to remove the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not fulfilled.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia’s unrestful east provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands – called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “diverse and widespread injuries” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group’s accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it’s hard to hide the evidence for human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to be aware of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says it’s not likely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he’s surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, except that they live under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papua, see their voice for Jokowi as a "cause" he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooters carried out a last symbolic act of disgrace: the body of a victim was buried on a ground right in front of the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never be given to them, but at least they do not let the responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with a headache.
“What else can we do?”
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
A fire broke down on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-storey building.
It’s the second fire to hit through the high house in just two years, randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident who said his name was George told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection authorities said that the fire control units at 4.00 local time (00 GMT) dissolved the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodation to the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials that are used in the outer areas of high houses around the world.
A survey by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from clothing, outdoor clothing to decoration or isolation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the system of the discs to isolate and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people were killed.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has passed through with his great Davis Cup in the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup points only on two wins was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Though often very long, but also very appreciated five-set classics remain therefore preserved to the tradition competition.
63.54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely failed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our membership nations have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
Not until the vote, after many disputes, had already come before the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round next year.
To reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers bring forbidden items into the aircraft, a survey reveals
A survey among flight passengers found that more than 20 percent of consciously or unconsciously banned objects passed through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally wearing banned knives or other objects with sounds.
Less than 1 percent said they had late discovered that they were mistakenly traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travellers were more likely to misunderstand the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were consciously trying to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately transmitted to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 percent acknowledged to have consciously carried items with sounds through security controls, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it has interviewed passengers across the country to find out how many mistaken smuggles have been brought through the airport security and how many have intentionally done it.
It’s no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling – consciously or unconsciously – through security were the ones who are most frequently flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are slightly complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take or how much of them.
Therefore, it is no surprise that the greatest amount of the objects captured by the TSA are prohibited fluids.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could see books as a scam.
Flights are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce with the enormous number of pre-order for his new Tesla Model 3.
It has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant numbers of sales increases and even more giant sales targets, Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has announced the latest quarterly balance sheet for the first time a different, less brilliant number: that of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk has often made over the past few months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.
Musk says, of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In case of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the $1000 (in the US $1000 and in the UK £1000) "reservation refund" completely.
Currently there are 455,000 such unbinding reservations, Musk spoke in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the CEO of Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of approximately 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.
The challenge to the ambitious growth goals is not on the demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected - all models together - to be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can expect the delivery not earlier than in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its new, never practically tested production routes without greater interruptions with maximum burden.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are greater delays, then the unbinding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from falling down.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns due to the delay in Obama’s emissions reduction rules
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, resigned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smog-powered air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to respond to the needs of state environmental authorities faster than previous governments.
He did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-to-ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "inclusion in local decisions or to hinder economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations against which the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed.
The sudden shift on Wednesday is the latest legal shift for the Pruit’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month a federal law court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager had exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanelecks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turning to ozone standards simply boosted the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely enforcement of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for execution and then awaits to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for execution," said Pruitt, who prosecuted the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have seriously."
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use his “power to delay and all other legal powers” to ensure that the regulations “base on a solid policy and the best available information.”
The Republicans in Congress call on a more comprehensive renewal of the ozon rules.
A bill approved last month intends to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that prosecuted the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and the environmental guardians rejoiced Pruit's surprising course change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to keep this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crossroads of the Trump administration, to engage in environmental pollutants and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates the 750th anniversary of St. Hilarius Church
750th Anniversary of the Church of St. Hilarius: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church is invited to the Old Cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 a.m. to a ceremony.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the site have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: “It’s a unique doorful small death.”
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen as well as the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 mark of silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a ruling court, to which the church or patronate law belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As follows from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be recognized today in the town picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the ruling settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 emphasize these historical circumstances.
The patronate law arose from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord, who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could inherit this own church.
This was associated with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two clocks on the tower.
The largest of the two destroyed on Christmas in 1673.
The newly built clock then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty-Year War (1616–1648) the windows were stolen and the clocks were stolen.
The roof was untouched.
In 1796, French troops stood near the church.
They broke out the channels and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last residence for the dead from hearing whiles.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was destroyed.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year's Eve of 1834, a storm broke down the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower, which still exists today, remained witness to the 750-year history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth Serenade on the Old Cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Chairman of the Board of Directors Hartmut Romann says the final word.
The program begins at 16.30.
Entry is from 15.30.
At the outskirts of the Serenade, a rally takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer night under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of the wines to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumlingen and hearing whales.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel especially committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
The Association wants to check the approval of wind roads
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore addressed the council.
The association "Boisheim defends" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its permission for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is essentially possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such areas are intended to prevent a “saving” of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decreed a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days ago by a change in the surface use plan, but the district government had not approved it due to a form fault.
“Because of the lack of planning legal condition, the granted approval order is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn,” said Christoph Erkens, chairman of “Boisheim defends.”
Current state of the things: the City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an approval from the district government is still out.
Recognition: "Therefore, at this point, the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind energy installations is planned by law excluded."
The Circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the Viersen Circle since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them the opportunity to review the matter again.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind wheels each 200 meters high on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had signed package contracts with the owner of the area of approximately 65 hectares.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants it is intended to be able to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which is approximately one-fifth of all four households’ electricity supply.
New Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor collapse: a woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 p.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was deadly injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealers plan "home-shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the centre of the city in September.
The trade union and the city administration will use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping bump in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade union, Christian König, announced, the “home-shops” weekend is intended to raise customers awareness of what offers the city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the centre of the city are to invite to the “Midnight Shop”.
The action is not only aimed at the residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed pockets that point to the action weekend, according to Christian King.
The City Administration and the Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Thus, the trade union and the city go into a further stage of the project "Attractive Centre".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Fountain Festival as well as the sale-soft Sunday, conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the dismissal of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
Customer potential needs to be reopened or reopened.
This includes tourists and tourists.
But many inhabitants had also lost sight of the centre of the city when shopping.
At the end, everyone had to contribute to the center of the city - up to rents, the enterprises of the whole city and associations.
It was worth overcoming the lethargy with a network, which has spread in part, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, said that five Thüringer cities will participate for the first time in the country’s third “Home-Shoppen” day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Saint Town and Bleicherode.
The day should “reclame for the appreciation of local trade and stronger expose its importance for the general well-being of our cities,” Streich said.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen with his purchasing behavior can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at a US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
Other people were injured.
A gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others, some of them seriously.
According to the firefighters, one injured was in critical condition on Wednesday.
One man died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
The first missing man was also saved later.
The dead were school employees.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday time, few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put Mexico under pressure after transcripted telephone calls due to paying border walls
Transcripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called for in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President shameed him because he had openly climbed the wall. according to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and promised to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a stressful exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia is "smiling", "mys" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was communicated by the Obama government would make him look like a "Depp" after he had proposed a ban on the displacement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, “this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reveal Racist Lynchact as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and runs to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons came out to block his way.
The Mobs leader - a middle-age man in a needle strip bag - took a long train on his cigarette and looked inspired through the windshield.
Inside the inhabitants were scared.
“We want this n ---- r Roger!” the man cried.
“Take him out of the car!”
Crying broke the silence when a young black man was thrown out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is just a replay.
But then, when a slice is thrown around the neck by "Roger", almost everyone in the audience is throwing out very real seafarers.
Since 2005, civil lawmakers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to take the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were coined by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murder.
"It's really unimaginable that in all these years no one person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the investigation.
“It’s a dirt on a story, but it’s a burden for our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime civil lawmaker.
For him, it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want punishment, we want end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to obtain justice,” he said.
“We can’t get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
A court doctor puts a bedtake over the body of one of the victims of Moore-Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI documents received from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
No one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have remained on foot for decades, civil lawmakers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom settled a white ground owner, Barnett Hester, during a battle - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that the horse had been sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison, the FBI said.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," a FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a complot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and hidden the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks formulates it even more clearly.
“It was a electoral law massacre,” he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, it will happen to you here."
For a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is clear, captivating and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to see, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the linen, because then we’ll face its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've gone through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - went into one room and heard when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Green’s co-regisseur.
He has been playing the role of the chief club member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not so,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the horse screams and presses him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!”
Rascona responds to the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing out.
Green laughs most loud.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” said Greene, still silent.
“I just don’t think that white people said ‘n—he’ at that time.”
“But,” laughed one of the other black actors.
“You just have to hit the hard ‘R.’”
And that’s where the energy moves in the room, a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the word N, he says it sharply and strongly.
No one is laughing.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shoots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a sad dress stands over the actress's body and carries out Billie Holidays' sad lobrede "Strange Fruit".
His voice breaks in every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, arrived to see the show, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s pushing moisture for eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murder has remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels ghostful.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children hoke on their heads, record the false blood and the silent bodies, and flush to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy murmured as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wash out their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the dress that played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks in their arms crying together, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women flirted.
“We know that it is not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
The audience later met with the actors for dinner.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta speaks enthusiastically about the follow-up with a black couple they’ve just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words which feelings the performance left.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
“What this really does with me makes me believe that the linen continues,” she added, “this is now called only police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds the court at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The postgraduate is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have suffered, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, whoever does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.”
"God's Damage" Reconciled the Wagnerian in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a colour-frivole inscenation in front of a giant, six-step colis.
The screenplay (designed by Aleksandar Denic) selectively shows a sliding street roof as well as the Wallerest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plast and Elaste" logo from the DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front there is an open Mercedes-Old Timer, in which the Rheintöchter poses as Rockergirls, or an alternative Isetta.
Gestapeled oil pipes remind Castorff’s lead motives – money, power and enthusiasm – that are drawn through his “ring” inscenation.
The three Rheintöchter - singed by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold" wonderfully.
Kess they seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), throw a body into the suitcase in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificently fitted hague surrounded by the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
But later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormful celebrations are held by Foster, Milling, Vinke and Director Janowski, who humble and shrinking their hands to the Merkel row.
There is great pleasure for the festival, which appears on the stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in mild recreational clothes.
The performance was expected by Frank Castorf and his team.
If he had to make a current Pfeif concert over himself in 2013, five years later, there was a great joyful in which the isolated “Buh” calls passed.
The game manager Katharina Wagner may have been pleased.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its viewpoint.
I draw a positive resume.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work equally in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in stone in the furniture pocket, once a week I help here in grefs in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school all day open.
How are your experiences with it?
A lot: It’s a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late-working volunteer.
How does this come?
A lot: I have graduated.
And then a building engineering study, let’s say, successfully broken down.
I realized for myself that it’s wrong for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
Then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the site, in the point of burning, really.
And was it so?
I have gathered great impressions.
In the winter semester I will start my studies in Social Sciences.
I’m going to study dual, I’m probably doing a social work training at the Herne Youth Office and I’m going to study in Hamm at the high school.
Is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from age home to youth work – in all possible facets of social work.
It was very variable to me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike the building engineering school?
Quote: Well, it’s not about calculating statistics.
There are many different people who have a different story behind each.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always take care of it individually.
very interesting.
Do you have no touch fear?
A lot: I am not the guy for that.
It is a place that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson Cuts More 3,000 Jobs and Cuts Dividend to Restore Business
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate numbers by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The decrease, which General Director John Fallon mostly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In a third cost reduction program in May, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its share in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said the prospects for the financial year were unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide attacker attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians were also killed in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence attack that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement it said the explosion had occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bombardment carried by persons".
According to the statement, all the injured are in a stable state and will be treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had committed the attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since the U.S.-led troops withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence emphasizes the poor security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA returns decision to delay the smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama government, according to which the states are obliged to halt the smog-causing emissions. This happened a day after 15 states appealed the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015" and said it shows the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPA to delay the ozone regulations - in which emissions will be measured in some parts of the country to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to recover a wide range of environmental records imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is intended to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the backdrop of the Democrats and Nature Conservation Groups, which are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing of the ozon-containing air “can reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
At the end, the decision was clear: with two oppositions, the municipality council of Fluorn-Winzeln will decide to establish a community space in the future senior residential facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase agreement for the still missing part of the land is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time until the area belonging to the church community is in municipal ownership, there is no longer any obstacle in planning for the project that a private investor will support.
There is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to come up with the municipality.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a boundary terrace with 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality are hoping that such a community space should not be seen as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the senior right housing, but openly within the municipality.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn, will be pushed by funding opportunities.
The building is in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a community space would be favorable, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that it is not to be throwed between his legs in this regard, the decision proposal provides for the establishment that both the seat – which is admitted to the environmental construction – and the plain roof – which reduces the height and makes the construction more economic – would be possible.
Unnecessary, not just Wilfried Sohmer says, is this add-on.
If it helps, it passes the group unanimously.
It is not so easy in the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you don’t get so straight forward, for that you now give up the community room out of the window, she says, “I make myself hard with it.”
Yvonne Staiger necessarily speaks for the community space – but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you don’t give any subsidy, but you get a real, in the case of doubt marketable counter value.
Staiger's request to distribute the decision proposal accordingly will be found by three supporters.
So it remains with two oppositions to the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: “When we make the decision this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge failure in our infrastructure.”
Collision with car: Radler is scattered on the road
During the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured and seriously injured by a car on Wednesday in Garath.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road by his bike at 12.20 p.m. on the cycling route of the Black Road from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the trail at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long fields walked on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite.
He collided with a car controlled by a 66-year-old assistant.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals miss the title defense in the Super Cup against the Pokal winner.
The staff concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20:30/ZDF and Eurosport) at the Pokal winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
It was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers lack Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” said Ancelotti, adding, “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good at last.”
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I am very confident that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who is expecting a “hard, intense game.”
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their ban.
The match was sold with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking from star to star
In Harz, the world’s first “star path” will be created.
This is planned by the Sternwarte St. Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" meets the need for information of many harb visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and sports performance.
Members want to set tables along the scheduled route and inform them about the stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Question came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented through the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
The star path will be extended by train.
“On the Star Trek the spectators learn a lot of information, for example about the physics of each star,” the association said.
They also learned why the stars had different colors or why one star glowed stronger than another, although it was much further away.
It will also be mediated in which star image a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest star guard in Northern Germany in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible.
In the Uni-City since 2003, on the initiative of the Foster Association Planetarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned starlight – the planetary path.
Starting in front of the Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stalls leads up to the Hainberg and the Star Wars - as well as a "outland" location in Diemarden (community of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The stalls with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dragon planet at the end point - are located exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exact 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the star with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fix star would take a half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should stand in a collision course to scan the most exciting boxing struggle in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the untouched World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-weight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds for pounds list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19:00 on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
“I’m an ex-weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I’ve risen for Broner, but I’m not so big.
I am small for 140.
I want to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans demand.
Let us give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxes need this battle.”
Climas asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pounds debut this year to agree on a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 Knockouts) who also has an interest in fighting against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on September 23.
“This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans have asked for it,” Garcia said and later openly expressed himself to struggle with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "gigant fighter" and he might be taking part in his Saturday struggle.
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said he thought the triangle champion from Riverside looks "very slowly out, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus is to show the strike strength, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the moment built for their own struggle.
“This is the struggle that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”
Four injured in pneumatic plots
In a crash on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira around 16.30 a.m. shortly in front of the connector Marketbreit probably lost control over his vehicle after a tire plate.
The car slept to the right into the hole, where he broke over and then lie on the roof in the green strip.
The four inhabitants – two adults and two children – were injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left trail could be transmitted to the accident point.
Fortunas Hoffmann: “Three-chain works better”
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the season match against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, if the two opponents were not 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“These were two opponents too much, and we have to be more careful in Aue,” said Fortuna’s defense player in Düsseldorf.
In the Arctic Mountains, the three-chain will also be further optimized.
And a gate after a freedom will no longer be captured by the fortunes.
“For the future it will be that no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).”
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in preparation, his team will get better with the three-chain than with the four-chain.
“I still don’t know how we’re going to act in Aue,” says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, “because we’re just in the third chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well,” Hoffmann said.
“It is a requirement, but that we’re even better harmonizing and we don’t make so many game errors in building.”
Of course, Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game.
“But if you can talk about a misleading start after a disagreement, I don’t know.
The performance could be okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand up with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup, we will be able to talk about a regular season deal."
His coach did not know anything about it.
“The start of the season I’m judging only after six to eight games,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn’t want to talk about an advantage against Aue, just because the match of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted in advance due to an unwinner.
“Now they can almost start the season with a home game,” said Funkel and Hoffmann believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresh because they don’t have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorit in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100% where they’re currently standing,” Fortuna’s internal defense officer says.
However, the guests from the Rheinland as a light favourite on Sunday go to the meeting at the final (fast) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we take them away only because we have the claim to get among the first six is foolish," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive if only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There's no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the forefront," Fortunas Chefcoach said.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming.”
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Test
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years old.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing last year.
They are intended to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some of the refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the time from the middle of March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "proposed that the person examined was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which röntgen screens of wisdom teeth and MRI screens of knee joints are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes evaluating the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later as usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it with certainty, we shouldn’t do as if we could,” he told Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of wrongly assessing a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is less than 18, in this case it is about 10 percent.”
Full in plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is going well forward.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the east entrance of Lauterbach.
“We’re very good in time, it’s going super,” says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the department of road and transport at the government presidency of Freiburg.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three recovery-need bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be followed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a cylinder bridge made of concrete, dressed with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border fixation, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meters wide bridge will be deployed on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path will go through.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges.
A special feeling of fingerprints requires the shift of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed by handcards about the project in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and cancers had to be detached.
For the bridges between the building and the collective floor in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is uniformly regulated by a lamp.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road in the bridge area at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely locked.
The cost of the three bridges is 700,000 euros.
It is all financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull on a string, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, which otherwise is hard to put under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully shares flag on that day because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall of Rondell invites to the so-called poster "Great Electoral Campaign Act".
And it brings known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the site hours before the event begins don’t want to listen to the AfD teachers, but to demonstrate.
The motto is “The Eifel remains colourful.”
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "all on a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the ronde - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that is presented.
And what Christa Karoli, the chairman of the Forum One World and one of the important organizers, really pleased: “That’s great how many people have gathered here.”
There’s music and a lot of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
Police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing their presence especially at the railway station, which is just a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has strived for such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially requested in Daun, but there he received a refusal because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is glad that "we can have such a nice event here."
Looking at the event on the Rondell Square, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
It also does that: Around 20 a.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rhine-Palestine AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are approximately 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to hold their speeches.
Police's presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the front square have a longer breath, but also there it is necessary to clean up shortly after 21:00.
Police can shut down - no special incidents.
Posaune met with Trompete
A repetition with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is present in the series of Haslacher Monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20:00 in the Monastery Church.
Together with the Bulgarian trompetist Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea encounters Black Forest", or just "Balkan Folklore" encounters a classic German training with roots in blues music.
Both solists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solopositions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to mix the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach tells the two as in a new dress, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of Jazze Priest Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core part of the program was launched only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it all,” Kristen Stewart says very openly about her bisexuality.
“When I kiss in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh, it was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was that with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually bitterly defeated.
Despite all this, the brune actress told the Harper’s Bazaar magazine: “I was seriously in love with everyone I’ve dated.
Or do you think I had played it?”
After her divorce, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
She suffered, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and shameful.
Now I look back and think, ‘My girl, be proud of you.’”
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me unacceptable, but I don’t like to have to justify myself before the whole public.”
Governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night in a protest with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I’ll tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought...Today I’ll tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can’t help you if I’m a democratic governor.”
The discourse broke out in joy.
“I’m going to change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice won not the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: "The change of party to Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from up to down without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unanimous message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "righteous" Russian apology for doping scandal
The worldwide head of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reintroduced into the sport.
Russia's Leight Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress in the evening of the World Leight Athletics Championships that the exclusion of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he's sorry for "all athletes who were stolen with gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the preservation of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has acknowledged in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is rebuilt."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to reset Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The main principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the damaged system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes will play as neutral athletes at the Light Athletics World Championships, which starts on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for a resignation.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
Treasure Act for Fallen Soldiers in Mali
During a sad celebration in Fritzlar, north Texas, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the town under high security measures.
About the unclear cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "canners of their field."
“We deny this highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Staff Chief from North Hessen were killed Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their sears were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom of St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr.
In the afternoon, only the relatives in the church took goodbye.
After that the feast began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and the politics.
Among them were Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Sad guests put roses down, the relatives stood arm-in-arm on the shells.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a wall.
Minister of Defense von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as “high-decorated” and entering.
The staff captain built the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also, Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, explained: "If this crew could not reverse the collapse, then no one would be able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: The operation is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the feast, the sheep were taken out of the dome.
When and where they will be delivered, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be entrusted next to his wife after his death.
This was by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The painter Bjørn Nørgaard has already prepared a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry will be buried is unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a heal that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's throne in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also gave the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik has not received in Denmark the title and the function he wanted, he does not consider himself equal to his wife, even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the spokeswoman of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last residence of the 83-year-old will be, is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be captured in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked over the past 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble race, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At Themse he worked in the French Embassy.
While his subsequent wife always flown the people’s sympathy, Prince Henrik had a severe situation with the Danish in his 50 years of reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik spoke about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I prefered wine instead of beer, silk stripes instead of stripes, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of the Virginia Tabac and which had the reputation of being the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope for certainty.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed.
It was just two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants new elections
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is for a quick new election after the Red-Green Government's loss, but he does not want to resign.
He spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament.
Earlier, the surprising withdrawal of a Greens from their council party in Lower Saxony had put the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the council election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its weak one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The previous Greens deputy Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her electoral district in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU group chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them.
CDU and FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far the relationship was the opposite.
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January of the next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the Landtag decide its self-release as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the National Day will take away the confidence of the Prime Minister and elect a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally clean,” Thümler said.
"Any question will be discussed in peace if it is legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten’s step “but somewhat Curios.”
She said, “I’m not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called for the abolished members to return their council mandate.
“We naturally assume that she will with immediate effect return her country mandate, which she has received through the Green List of Countries,” state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
The party chairman of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely."
She consciously decided not to hold a discussion in the group.
Even in the background that there were no content differences, we can’t understand this step.”
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the breach of the lower-Saxon Greens member Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
“The behavior of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal to the voters, but also a betrayal to the Red-Green,” the Federal Council of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the council.
The departure of Twests costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
“In her wounded jealousy and frustration, she puts her personal interests in front of the country’s good,” SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticised.
“It’s a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to hit political capital from it.”
Niedersachsen's CDU group chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend his members to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The party leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, called on Twesten to falsify the result of the 2013 council election with personal careers.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a sharp-thin majority of one vote.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing the empty eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the RedactionsNetwork Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, How can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to carefully look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de the federal states submit the latest information on the affected egg charges.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we are currently knowing, a health danger is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response – all the eggs out of the offer – because the central role of the investigator is not truly perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known about Germany’s affairs.
All information and risk assessment are accessible to consumers.
The trade, just like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are trafficable and health-free.
If the remaining maximum content is exceeded by 0.005 mg/kg in eggs, they are not transmissible.
Unbelasted eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not guilty.
Are manufacturers and consumers sitting on the same boat?
According to the timely knowledge, the manufacturing enterprises are not directly guilty.
Instead, they must expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Does it just lack the staff or the key responsibility?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
This is why a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in cases where crimes may occur are of crucial importance.
I have repeatedly made it clear that I expect the responsible authorities to be informed.
Is regular alarming in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and accessible foods.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are fairly annoyed.
Through the packed means, manufacturers, merchants and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the behavior of livestock animals is unacceptable and must be immediately terminated.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and without fault.
How Football's Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Migration to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football teams will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without great losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can make the money easier for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
The teams are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to defend with legitimate sources of income that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken over huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on clubs’ debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP implementation period, which lasts until 2018, clubs can bear losses of EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini’s 2015 presidency falling unhappy, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to engage in fear of excessive spending.
“Surely FFP is not dead and we’re going to strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s Buy-out clause in a fixed fee, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the discharge amount for the next five years is estimated at €44.4 million in annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, met with the heavest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League season 2014/15 remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by flourishing their revenue by companies linked to the club owners.
While a Qatar company could sponsore the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard markets, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was deposited by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was that part of PSG’s payments to Neymar could come through payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more careful to observe any attempt to overcome the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, the people who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and trick sales.
The association expects that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is in possession of an American sports tycoon, shares the reserves of La Liga against a state that funds a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new shipping supplier
In recent years, Chocolat has produced free board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the delightful cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report to the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to the current plan, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products will be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
“We are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey,” the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packed 14 gram ski tables each year are distributed by companions before landing to passengers.
The Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But the most important is the advertising effect: for a shogging manufacturer, it is a prestigious task.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
Only Swiss manufacturers are concerned.
According to the newspaper’s report, Chocolat Frey will endeavour to renew the contract beyond the spring 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for a comment.
The Swiss has distributed chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-range flights, First Class customers are swept with flavours by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers shoggy from Lindt and in the Economy Class shoggy from Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short track Swiss Schoggi distributes Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will struggle for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, had failed in the national World Cup election and was able to watch the discussion struggle only from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defense Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repeat of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-grunge era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter directed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and a corporation of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise it feels like the time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By hiding themselves on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play ugly children who will grow up - they still created the impossibility to win the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more according to the gathering principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline sketches, and “a series of other things from the year 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the novel author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-bad plot, which includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon’s underlippenbart of “Singles” whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could raise this franchise like a kind of repeating “Seven Up!” series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer”.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West Ring Fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director tells to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-sotted Gregor and an idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is a genius idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes it gets there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited for a smaller length, could deliver his agitprop satire better as Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who sweat a crowd of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that the western culture can make everything food for a pleasure.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and their own.
Attacks against drug mafia in the country
Police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar Circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, according to the Prosecutor's Office Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused men between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and arrested.
In addition, the officials saved larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
In Italy, two people were arrested.
The two suspects were arrested by Germany.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.
Over 300 police officers were involved.
Members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, and theft and persecution.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating Konstanz against the organized drug trafficking in the southern German area.
There was a rough exchange between the prosecutors in Constantinople and Palermo, and the Kripo Rottweil investigators had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the Great Operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the vision of the investigations were mainly Italian citizens with close reference to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shootings were shot in a hostel early in the morning, is likely to go to the band’s account.
How to complain about large gap in the Foreign Registry
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the Foreign Registry in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s refugee management commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has pointed attention to large gap in the Foreign Central Register.
Failures in the data registered there could lead to "particularly serious errors" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned in an analysis presented by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register contains 10 million people with foreign citizenship, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been kept adequately, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, “of people who have long not been alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore.”
"False data input can significantly slow down the return process," the report continues.
In the statistics on persons obliged to leave, there are also EU citizens who shouldn’t have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however, led to “a distorted debate on how to deal with expatriates,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugees with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This is stated from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is carrying out such procedures “with regard to families with children – with the exception of infants and infants – to Italy since 1 June 2017”.
Since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country may send him back to the country of entry.
According to the statement, “the capacity of accommodation for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly.”
Italy has issued guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these promises sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Internal policy spokeswoman of the left party in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened because of the defects in the Italian asylum system, uninhuman reception conditions and a danger to the child's well-being."
The second best result
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service has already made available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality in the council meeting honors the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s great how our bodies are designed for it, and we must give respect to the donors that give their blood to strangers, even unprofitable,” said mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," said Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross, as the conservances are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," the DRK Circle Preparation Leader said.
Obviously, the change to the theater house led to higher participants numbers a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many recorded Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times each 500 milliliter of their life juice.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation decline have suppressed the speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “drained” as itins interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for a rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budget revenues would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
But she pointed out that interest increases would be needed in the coming years to boost the inflation heated by Brexit and she said the credit costs might need to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammut Conjuncture Package, which was issued a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from February next, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the GDP remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
At the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain strain of monetary policy" would be required to cool the inflation and a "slightly greater" scale than the markets expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that the increases would be made “progressively” and “limited”.
The bank’s growth forecasts for this and the next year, corrected below, are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts for May.
It hasined its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth figures have suppressed the rising expectations of interest rise and the GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slowly recover by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by an increasing inflation and low salary increases, as the exacerbation first becomes even worse before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy can’t “hinder the income decline” in the coming years, but she added that the wages will “definitely” recover at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes a year after the interest rates dropped to 0.25 percent last August after the shocking EU voting that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last ruling on the interest rates, the reputation for a rise of interest was increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-depressed households, with three policy makers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected and will pull it back in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target is "completely" to allocate to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as creditors are loudly looking for and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks good for those with which the existing deals run out and the new mortgages conclude, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) plans to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
From September after a struggle before the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS, patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV preventive treatment.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) taken before gender, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it.
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention" while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a "defining moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection.
These medications can be taken every day or two hours before the sex.
Those who are questioned for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is unknownly controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study aims to evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This big new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when aimed at people in need and in danger, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We are very pleased with this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been achieved, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV.”
Sharon Hodgson, Secretary of Shadow Health, said: “The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delay and urgent implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the great life: middle floor and smart designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
"Davor I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high roofs.
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overwhelmed.
Originally, a one-room property with a decorated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a staircase and a middle floor to make the generous roof height optimal.
“I wanted high roofs, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my request,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high roofs and create a house that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The roof was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge consisted in creating a middle floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the proposal.
“The steel is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked around each other, without having to break.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Reflective gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridore is sealed to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide room for all the coats and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Compatible cuisine is nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A little engineering art went into there,” Erfan explains from the steel-fortified, fornified MDF door.
"It's balanced so that when you push the door, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of room and storage room, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate broker will enter and make a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electric stickers in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that a apartment can be transformed from something standard to something quite amazing by good design and increased square meter.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight for $500 million real estate imperium
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation is ongoing at the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than a half billion dollars, accumulated since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city scene, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the corporate assets and Paul about a third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The distribution proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed interrogations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also struggling for the control of the existing business – from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but claims Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In a early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and by both sides held lawyers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicious dishes from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a business in Brunswick.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood legacy in which Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to deliver their property gently to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to fall before the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark had paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark are, Paul says, “will be disappointed by the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin stayed very back, though he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say a lot" because the case was before the courts.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to prosecute me and pull our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.
“Our father would not want Paul and I to end our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “has always hoped for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to have passed.
“Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new head of state plans to restrict the president’s media authenticity.
Others tried it and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House staff chief plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more equal course.
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the White House’s new head of staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the president’s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tighten Trump by monitoring his media diety.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back for decades – and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When Trump’s candidate was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from points to be convinced,” former election counselor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise.”
Okay .
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something that we others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more pollutant without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his employees have managed to keep his trouble away from him a few times, then his efforts are worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from raising controversy.
Part of the problem is that the people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - fully engaged with this story - in May about the preference of consultants to provide the president with doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Actual and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s hoping to find out where they come from.
It was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provokator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Head of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a crowd of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of scams or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then Staff Chief Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter “has tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives.”
How did it work?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Per he will prove himself as a more efficient manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most-seeked criminals receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be asked and hoped.
Police across Europe send this summer (virtual) postal cards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the searched serious criminals are naturally unknown, evidence from the population is hoped and requested.
Europol on Friday the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" winter advent calendar.
The experience has shown that many flyers are hiding to vacation destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were collected for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website.
Travelers Negotiate a Grave and Return to 'Millionaire Series'
Some of the wealthiest household owners of the West Midlands stand again with some determined travelers on the foot of war, who negotiated one of the tombs taken by the municipality to demand a field in front of their masters.
The travellers parked their 20 residential cars on a field outside a wealthy street in Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire Series".
They brought horses, babies, and an army of carriers after they were thrown out only in May, without being scared by a council-trapped grave to prevent their crashes.
The tactical group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unblocked to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have pressed Solihull’s council, who said it’s “useless to deal with the problem.”
One anonymous resident said, “They’ve been taken there on Monday night after they’ve been sent by Bentley Heath, where they’ve thrown stones on the passants.
The Council must be forced to be implemented by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved and are now back.
More came yesterday night, probably more today.”
She added: “Birmingham’s council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers, just to be planned by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking area.”
A spokesman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the ground beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
To support our proof collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101 .
This contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case.”
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof to the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently renovated and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, at that time, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue due to the currency tax.
In the autumn of 2014, due to the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the countryside, the hotel building was offered to the council office as a collection accommodation, leading to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the council.
But above all, Freudenstad’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious stakeholders at the house.
He should be right.
The Group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary sale in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the Three-Star-Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the pleasant town object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear how extensive renovations are being done.
The soils were cut out, roofs partially destroyed, old bathrooms removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s really a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renovated in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large accessible douches, the entrance area is re-designed, new windows are built.
Everything should later become a "beautiful bourgeoisie", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a jewelry out.”
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
We do not want to position ourselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated level of the city centre, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be widespread, Scherer explains further.
Both individual tourists, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he has already conducted, Scherer said.
The views of the city are equal to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
It is less than a million euros, he expects.
The outer facilities are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an interior courtyard is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant that is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “Freudenstadt is a good market.”
Russian case: U.S. special broker calls on the Grand Jury
In the Russian case about U.S. President Donald Trump, the special mediator Robert Mueller said to have employed a so-called Grand Jury.
The group has started the work over the past few weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote with reference to people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN that there are already the first invitations of the group in connection with a meeting between Trump’s oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of targeted interference in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump’s election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is to be several men who acted as the Republican’s counselor in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller has also taken more and more Trump’s private and business environment under the lobby.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special mediator Trump personally brought the center and is investigating the accusation whether the president may have hindered the justice in the course of the case.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether to appeal.
The Grand Jurys are also called the Prosecutor's Chambers.
Most of them are enabled when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body may also be connected by the Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to the hearing.
According to CNN, pre-callings have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The people who participated in the meeting were invited to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son Jared Kushner and his then election campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts told U.S. television on Thursday night that the introduction shows that Mueller will not be scared in his work and that he would want to act quickly if necessary.
However, it is not necessarily to say that the Grand Jury will be closed in the end to decide on the processing of an accusation.
However, the establishment of the group is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russian case as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats a way to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.”
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement he didn’t know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they often work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House advocates any measures that accelerate the work of the special mediator in a "faire" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it will not be investigated against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it is said in the statement.
But Mueller was only used after Trump had released Comey.
Because of this dismissal, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
This triggered speculations about whether Trump wants to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special mediator, such as in the Watergate case about the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice on the presence of the president.
However, several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators submitted a draft law on Thursday, according to which the special mediator could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Ice Mountains Strike in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a giant ice mountain of just seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved itself from the shelf.
This was by the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.
The more than a billion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers large colossal is now moving to the north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the glacier is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual crashes in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a background of fact.
According to many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The colossal was a part of the Larsen-C Schelfe.
Schelfeis swim on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It thus grows more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Schelfe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
In the north of this shell, the balance of growth and decline was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can break if a piece breaks in a key spot.
The melting of slurry and ice mountains does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and ice throws as much water as it produces after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the slope leads to the fact that the glaciers can go directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea level, but only in a small amount, the British research project for Antarctic observation (Midas) writes.
According to AWI, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica, with 50,000 square kilometers.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks out there regularly.
"Al it's a natural event and we're not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the UK's Swansea University.
“This is the longest withdrawal since the recording began,” he also confirmed.
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C shell will now grow again or will slow down in the long term and may collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Though these researchers do not refer the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change, in the last decades, many glaciers have broken down on the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long hill of the Antarctic extends toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years and is one of the regions where the temperature rises most rapidly.
CDU wants home tariffs for staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to occupy freelance jobs, the CDU calls on to leave the employer’s association to become more attractive.
Just shortly before the summer break, the Circular Day gained 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, 17 teachers have their first working day behind.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very sought.
About 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be given this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to be able to deal with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unemployed places in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers, as well as the forces of general administration are searched among others.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and address the lack of staff in the administration.
The administration is intended to “develop a concept for the acquisition and development of personnel” according to the wishes of the parties.
The goal is not only to cover the short-term needs of professionals, but to counter the candidate weakness in a future-oriented way, he says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, showing concrete measures for sources and involving a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG call for.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
It is about a fair “competition of public employers”.
This includes a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is time to act so that no more jobs remain unemployed.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the party leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a fastidial surprise in the day when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and surprised the rest of the parties.
The peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed that enable a withdrawal from the municipal workers’ association.
"If we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the circular administration should seek a home tariff with the trade unions - even in collaboration with the circular cities," the people said.
Thus, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff for the public service actually implies.
The wages are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money there is only when you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the task of the circle has grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be established in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the growing number of asylum seekers, council Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy increases the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs don’t sign a new Code of Conduct, it’s hard to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis’ warning came one day after the Italian authorities had captured a boat of the German aid organization ‘Young Rettet’ because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, the rescue of human lives is and remains our top priority, so we’re very sorry that we can’t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,” the organization said in a statement to social media.
"We can judge all the accusations that are currently being raised only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes ships of migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting was alleged to take place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's document, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to move beyond the authority of the Italian coastal guard, the rescue operations in the area are monitored for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, ships like the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared willing to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "significant changes or obstacles" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined significantly in the past few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperate with the local mayor's leadership have been fruitful.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the Berliner Außenposten and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
It followed views, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the Pfälzer Forest and the pre-loading levels.
Meanwhile, there were more and more long increases, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view grew to the point of view, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate rise.
In the last two days, many meters of height were required.
Cave, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entrance houses brought welcome pauses.
In Bad Dürkheim, the cyclists in the outdoor inhalatory breathe healing sun.
Neustadt was also supported.
After 173 kilometers and 4500 meters of height, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side – sports and cultural –.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is preparing for e-Sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles rather than struggling by wind and weather over the stadium races?
The fact is: E-Sports has long become a serious industry, a profitable business - big stars, millions of fans, and huge high-gage tournaments including.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesligavereins, who are increasingly engaged in this field.
The start was made in 2015 by the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last by the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
“We hope that this will encourage all new young target groups for the VfB,” said Jochen Röttgermann, the Board of Directors.
He is sure that “there will be a lot of troops on this train.”
The next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association will host the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in eSports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent eSports under contract, you could be online much more frequently present on these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is it exactly?
In the eSports, computer games such as “League Of Legends”, “Dota 2”, “Counterstrike” or just the football simulation FIFA will be picked out on competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSports are already part of the official program.
Is this a good sport at all?
For many, the idea is a need for habit.
Ingo Froböse has also discussed the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsibility.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
“The fitting player is a good player.”
But Froböse also sees problems: “Doping becomes more and more a topic.”
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.
Positively, the scientists highlight the high integrative effect of eSports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study by the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts an rapid growth in eSports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Until the £2.4 billion of the football league, this is very little.
However, the eSports are “not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” Deloitte’s advisors write.
Many countries are internationally.
Large markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
A lot is done in Europe as well.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a classroom, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football First League teams are now obliged to establish an eSports department.
“In the European comparison Germany goes behind,” says VfB’s Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Just to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, no longer is enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time setting the company on the modern market.
“We live in a digitized world,” says Dutt.
“You can’t keep it up that only in football everything remains as it was always.”
Toxic Egg Ade - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Cooking
The scandal on gifted eggs has affected almost all federal countries.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs should be taken into the containers that are proven to contain no fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced for text that pushed Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind her conviction and five years have been exposed to proof.
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is untrusted.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored bluse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned.
“Your actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility,” she said.
“He did not show regret.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible circumstance that she’s completely regreting.”
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity degree or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there's no day when I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything.I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us forever.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be “traced” by the awareness that she would never participate in her brother’s wedding or be a tante for her children.
“To no longer have this single person I’ve been with every day since I’ve been born is a pain I’ll keep with for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to put a legal prejudice as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stop up, jump out of a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before her death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is to turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox was sentenced in 2007 to murder her British resident in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Knox, 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from FC Bayern's new Mini-Lahm
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to play in the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were seen, he made the bond assigned to him standing on his arm.
“The coach has not announced it,” the Confed Cup winner said after his first match as Bayern Captain.
Well, the match could have been better than at 0:2 against the SSC Napoli.
But the sign of the coach could Kimmich explain that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf professional from youth players, debutants and just coming from the vacation, but he.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in mood.
So whoever has been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only take a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich said, “This is what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-light.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bond on the arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich appeared in this start-up formation as the one who can best take the router in hand.
He gave instructions, trying to guide the unmatched troops.
He looked at the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with it to overplay his lack of fitness (will hardly succeed); Renato Sanches with it to get out on the devil to connect to the achievements of the Asian trips (will also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it to not catch negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Trique.
After all, it worked very well.
Sule ran next to Kimmich, Rudy ran up before the defence, both acted sovereignly.
The namely occupied Napoli turn was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed several times in the game building.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was “not as we expected it.”
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Game transfer, Tempowechsel: "For this style I was also picked up."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new arrivals, you saw after the match.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crazy statements in the back of his new co-player.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Sule: "What is going here, I have already noticed.
In Bayern, you just have to win every game."
After all, he no longer has to teach the new one.
Alaba motivates women from ÖFB
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer announced on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB women all good.
The Bayern Legionaire is a quasi club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiber with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winners should be a special motivation.
The famous Bayern Dusel might need our ladies well as well.
Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Palestine Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often unreliable when Eveline Lemke (Grüne) was still Minister of Economy of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is revealed more than a year after the new economic minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on the T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time replace the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: “Wissing affects the desires of the economy, which has blocked all of the fat.”
The biggest shift is seen by Natus in the infrastructure policy: the closure of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Even this year the Ministry hopes on a plan-making procedure, the construction law is expected to be in place by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the West Environment Trier, which stands in the preconditional need of the Federal Traffic Plan.
The goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020, said ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but international competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier seeks, as Wissing encouraged, to establish a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine export that has been shrinking for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, IHK praises.
The craftsmanship Chamber Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of €1000 is provided for the master's examination and €2500 if graduates make independence within ten years after the master's degree.
However, the list of household tasks for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are quickly to be made, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, IHK Trier’s chief executive.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to stop mobility in the country’s operations, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf points to the bills of the Court of Auditors that the country will invest in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receiving country roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to fix the lack of staff in the region.
Furthermore, the previous broadband development in the country is annoying.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey only with a score of 3.4.
They complain about storing internet connections and breakdowns.
Former economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green faction left Lemke in April to become the president of a private college in Karlsruhe, where after four months of disagreement, she has already dismissed the field again.
Audi plans to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automotive manufacturers face a counterreaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW’s chairman said the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emissions rules.
But the oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for the car manufacturers to install facilities to neutralize the gas emissions emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of disturbing the powerful automotive firms and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called discharge devices to comply with the rules when a car was tested but returned in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to overcome the emission regulations in Europe, and a query focused on the United States was extended.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a heavy burden for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes overproportionally to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has flooded on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the visitors of Isar, a flood will pass through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
Those who go again to the Isar on Saturday will see a great flood there between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a usual flood, with Isar tourists.
The construction department wants to clarify.
On the flood you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a waste mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the visitors of Isar.
With the motto "Wahre love is ..." it is intended to strengthen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild stream.
For the past summer, the flood went over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to careful and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's knolennasis and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was occasionally one of the most popular cartoon characters, and the nonsense of his characters are his brand.
At the age of 85, the Argentine filmmaker is still working on a film.
His message: Laugh, “because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he passed through, among other things, as a cartoonist for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
“The happier day in my career life was the day I lost in my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists were inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are embedded in drawings with the throwing tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own information, he still sits on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, puzzles and clocks, his horrible figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-fussler as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters talk in the 3D film, which is scheduled to come to the cinema in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he’s more relied on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of the Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is declining due to the conditions reminding of drought and because of the diseases transmitting insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Lavendel in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This affects the life of lavendel.
There is also a small cycade, a microbacterium that transmits cycades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them.”
There is a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also highly demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing the deforestation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuring Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary today.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cremes, cents, merchants, vagans or a land slave camp should be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they gathered together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of a 2009 grenade attack, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s salary list or the cartel, a catalog of criminals that make Mexico’s chaos dangerous.
There is no break from the violence, and as the bodies rise throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states.
Among the latter are her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply perceived, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez that shows his midfinger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smileful face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their dreams, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murders of journalists are rarely put before trial.
In Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrusted and although the land is now even more traitory.
Without information about the murders, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we disbelieve everyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the country’s capital city of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "the Twelft River".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adults.
The rumors tend to flow freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot down on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausols for drug kings, which are greater than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Despite and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
Initially, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the competing cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues admitted that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Northwest in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, “It was impossible to run journalism without facing the rubble problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising gained.
Reporters liked to be able to publish hard-to-do investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one wished to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever he was.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to continue to live,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do with so many dead... why didn’t you say what happened?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could flock like a port worker, the friend who was generous with kisses and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust their routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you’re engaged with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and land trails, to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-sufficiency.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be misleading ... and then the thing happens with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative rubber routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. days earlier it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself called unreliable.
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug bonds are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
It was the murder of the brother of former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition on the state expenditure, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this site, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military attack.
Just a few months ago, readers had seen the Valdez column as the most informed source about the kidnapping.
“In the past we’d already know what’s happening,” said Villarreal, 46, with the top name ‘El Flaco’ because of his weak body status.
“Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they’d never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests, that it was his own.
Journalists throughout the country have become stronger by scrolling "SOS Press" on walks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is leaving in Washington, where he tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and making them killed because they said the truth.
Since then, she has asked for her to be redistributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has damaged her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an independent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were stuck with the organized crime under a roof.
The media watch group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murder has a frightening effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headsets were next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue to work, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, acknowledges that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
By midnight on last Friday, when the last edition was already over, the editors of Riodoce sat on the burgeon in front of the office and drank beer as they suddenly started summing all their phones.
A series of shootings with gangrivals and security forces near the bathroom Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel missions in the region.
From the edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried out nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his traces.
“How can you just remember,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting.”
Dinosaur Used Turning to Escape His Enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a scary.
Now researchers have found that the first discoveries of an incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even notice that her scratched skin was red brown - and they said she would have had something of a "unpleasant past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved pansed dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the Crete period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved state has surprised researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the packed plant feed is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grumbed on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rocks on the spot, and decided to look closer.
The fossil found by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy land clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it has been asleep," said the chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although it is covered with a weapon and resembles a moving tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The strongly pansed dinosaur used a red and white tint to hide from the robbery, and used a screening technique known as the countercover, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better mix into its surroundings and escape its enemies, experts say, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made signs for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli by the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shells and weapons over his body.
They discovered the countercatering, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's top was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter-catering is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far greater than the size of today’s living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by the meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution benefited the hiding of confrontation as a means of survival.
But the majority of contemporary animals that use the countercatering - think of rehe, zebra, or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than the beast, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong rabbit behavior on a massive, strongly pansed dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur rabbit had to have been in the time of creation,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what he has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea ground.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further into land than they are today.
“This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved smooth skin, but also remains in three dimensions and preserves the animal’s original shape,” Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early creation period.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just swallow a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he’s sleeping.”
The creed era was a time when enormous theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the pansed dinosaur was hunted by some of his scary ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta after death was drowned in the sea and mummified in the slam.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grumbed on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-reserved pansed dinosaurs in the world, including skin and weapons, and is completely from the slope to the hole.
The creatures were an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spots that rushed from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the packed plant feed was swim through the western Canada until a flooded river flows it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater reserve saved his weapons in exquisite details.
The decayed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hills are still covering hollow tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it is.
Protected remnants of the skin still cover the holy tank plates that carry the animal's neck.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shells on his seed.”
In the storm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Incident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass karambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometers long stays - and gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-München Highway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police’s first information, around 17:00 between the connectivity stations of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg) during a storm, 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, were intertwined.
The exact number of injured were not at first.
These were slight to medium injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large shipment of rescue vehicles was on the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich was formed a roughly ten kilometers long backbone.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities occurred on the counter trail as well - through numerous gaffer.
The firefighters recorded the signs of the vehicle lockers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group Tests “Comfort Check-in”
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you sit in the train and sleep without knowing anything.
Or you are deepened in your work and just have a genius thought.
And then: pufff.
The creator comes and awakens a disappointment or throws the passenger out of the workflow in the middle.
control of tickets.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the unfaithful driving card control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devaluate the driving card.
Currently, a test operation is on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many other remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," a spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train the ticket rating without the creator.
To be able to use them, however, a few conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
You must also use the app of the train, which DB Navigator has purchased, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets.
Lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the “Comfort Check-in” works as follows: You get to the train, call your ticket under “My Tickets”.
At the test customers then a button for electronic devaluation appears.
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train companion arrives at the check-in to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting with an online ticket that has already been discounted.
You can sleep, work, and keep silent.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which, in turn, has to benefit the passengers.
“Those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train accompanying staff simply check in the DB Navigator themselves.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Distance Transport.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet the individual customer needs."
Those who frequently ride the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the check-in cards are among the greatest troubles.
For often you have yourself, but in any case one of the companions does not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets.
Or the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document that you need to show.
The consequences are endless discussions between the train companion and the passenger, which leads to poor mood in the department or large area and delays in controlling their own ticket and the creator at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of testing customers can still use the new service.
ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not open yet.
How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Which streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
“The police have just killed a 18-year-old boy, and it’s still on the street,” it said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the trade @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was trying to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's unhealthy body that was stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She set out her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a belling dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer disguised his weapon and screamed, “I’m going to kill you... animals all.”
“This is not usual,” Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the type of murder we have used to and we can typically call it.”
At that moment I felt cold.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the topic of a new documentary, "Wose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a corresponding crown, traveled to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “on the black experience and the black state.”
“Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?” she remembered what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn’t take them with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What has happened today is a peak of what has happened in the past.
He must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, knowing not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to be free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I’m lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience exciting racism, she’s not different from the next black women’s child.
I feel like I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.”
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place in front of the police, which became a camp area as the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped deliver them to the protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to accept for Ferrell's shape.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come.”
Several weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration with Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regulators of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
A question came to Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was fed by countless cases by people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-register Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around the death strike insects.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Wose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
“This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us, we’re talking,” Davis said.
"It was the main thing for me how these people will be represented, for this is how I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that gathers," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents from "Who streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, filmed "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” said Ferrell, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is reallyined by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person that sparked this energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence, though she was on the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racist connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell has been sentenced for 21⁄2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home, “a chaos.”
Nevertheless, she climbs to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she went on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Grand Thunder": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center in the south of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the topic hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friendly Bitburg".
While one of them says to the bit gallery, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really class" (Nicole Shousten), it comes from the other side, "You don't need a man" (Siggi beds) or simply, "Grand Thing!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which the rest of the stores will benefit from, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then get out of blood.
Additionally, the gallery is planned exactly on the land where the farmer market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, it will end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are always very pleased.
We have also discovered the melting for us.
We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there was a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, that is the case as well.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.”
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers sit in a market hall in the gallery, it depends on the amount of rent.
However, it is not likely to be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, pharmacies or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here – some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is so important that at least the market hall remains.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the manufacturer and is, on the other hand, cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, because the rental there is often unbearable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, special business is almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping center with a market hall doesn’t fit me together.
And the gallery doesn’t fit to Bitburg.
First of all: Where should the farm market hall go during the construction time?
The old edeka would be the solution - even for long, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or is it the Ghost Bit Gallery already able to sell all the shops from Bitburg?”
George Marquet: “It simply won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs it either.
I think it would have been better to promote a fair farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the madly many – as I find – meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, it no longer gives place.
If the farm market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A Suitable Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits With Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarkably similar - hanging on cables from the roof.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wangen-tupfers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the outputs from the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst sentenced 35 years in prison after she made secret diplomatic reports public via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and distinctive dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look, created a sharp but some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a naked, black-white selfie in which Manning visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde peruck - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette rubber and rubber rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to make an image of how these people could look.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said at a press show of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unparalleled letters, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform the judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcoming kind of happy meeting.
There is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, tweetable ways to further explode the strange divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that “Things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her overwhelming signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic disintegration, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand folders of Cs and Gs and As, written in blade.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so there are the 30 of these stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she appears with a speaking phone in the hand from the disciplinary core of the United States such as King-Kong.
“If they cool your speech, they’ve won,” he says.
So never stop your mouth.”
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
“I still get pimples when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulation acres, gathering like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's statue), in which their genetic haplog groups were written with blade.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said from the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation.”
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford searched for murder
A country-wide human hunting is ongoing for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are being sought after a man was hit in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, arrest orders were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the documents of the Court of Justice of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stages.
A community warning system published by the Chicago police agency says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the incident, and detectives are investigating the plot as a murder while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an exceptional professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in vacation and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to appeal to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are increasing,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying something happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the deadline and the background of the victim and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
“We will complete the WADA road plan in the near future,” Russian Vice-President Mutko said.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“In a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA travel plan has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA’s roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-introduction of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
One of the criteria listed, however, points out that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded doping in Russian sports.
With regard to the case, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has acknowledged an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words agreed with the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In a conversation with the Russian sales station RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has the intention to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be resumed.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs.
This was shared by the company groups.
This is a purely precautions measure, no further health damage can be prevented, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs will be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been negatively tested on fipronyl-containing anti-loss.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees’ happiness at your eCommerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or, even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco eCommerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
He called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases it allows whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows on a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low-approval results - so you can track why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay in the top of the workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of disturbances in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for a overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Industry could possess more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "puls" surveys, collect confidential real-time answers and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience expensive consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business center.
Earlier, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track staff complaints.
Now, as the company employs Convercent, problems that previously were hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices – can be more quickly identified and addressed.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
“And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes.”
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty washing from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It’s a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern seized $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies work well. companies work well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the engagement and employment of employees, it’s no wonder that you find support.
The data about the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless when the managers of a company do not take any action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that the change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come quickly enough, or not at all, this can raise disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask yourself, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And who don’t care about it, why should I do it?”
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets increasingly new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of employees in a industry known for high revenues.
“If you’re not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you’ll lose the people,” Vitrano said.
And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the bruins
It starts at 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team’s new exercises on the campus.
Some have pulled out their t-shirts and showed their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these unsuccessful minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real breakthrough for the boys for the next three days," Bruns coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to relieve the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19:15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood performed practical exercises.
They are scheduled to take over the course of August 18 exercises. 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he’s supporting the NCAA’s regulation change, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
“We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they’ve just pushed it through, they’re cracking, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and have more time, it’s really great.”
The UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been targeted with football balls that dissolve a protective network behind a gate post.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora said there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far from thinking that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video band of an exercise, it’s a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I don’t worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party facts reviewers and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to facts reviewers who may show the results of the facts review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being overwhelmed with false stories before the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hatred posts like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a new facts review test will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to finding out what stories from facts reviewers will be appealed by third parties, people want more context to make thorough decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "linked article" and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Create a Comic: A Castle in the History of England
In its younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now becoming the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophary Yorkshire man with a love of historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has died for 300 years,” he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England" spans the time from the Middle Ages to Edward's Age and documentes the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the fingerprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 17th century who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
“This is his fingerprint.
Letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was burned because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it was himself.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I overestimated my welcoming grace a little") all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted Hyane heads on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the land and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank “whiskey and started writing.”
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006, when the last inheritance, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roof."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that show who possessed something: "You could think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birk for the two families have fought.
“Men, let everything go!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farmer rebellion.
“There’s a record of an outbreak that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The farmer uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising would be a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Pater, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who scored his own funeral by filling a shell with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his shell was grabbed).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite scammers, constantly making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women – I imagine them as a crowd of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise heritage.”
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He took a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the ground of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been recalled by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go back,” he said.
It was like, “Ah, now I have to deal with the forgiven life again.”
More than 300-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf
With the flooding of the 301 year old Mary chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof mark (Rundschau von Donnerstag).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, a festival will be held on the island of Grafenwerth as the peak of the campaign.
“Beautiful for us.
Or?” asked the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We don’t really think of it,” they wrote on their website released yesterday.
“But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
The action is about more than “only” a logo and a slogan.
“It is necessary to formulate a solitary promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique character.”
They are in competition with other municipalities.
With an average of five points, the city of Bad Honnef will cost its new roof mark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey: Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year, at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirement and transportation in the officer's body.
So this week as well.
At first glance, it is a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish army a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents, as well as Ministers of Defense, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the consultations under the presidency of the Prime Minister.
Thus, the civilians in YAS were in excess.
The government is pushing the roofs in the military.
General Chief Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has shot down 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's rows - mostly due to alleged connections to the exile editor Fethullah Gülen's movement, which Erdogan sees as the drawer of the coup attempt.
About 486 people who were supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the coup, Erdogan called the coup attempt a “God’s gift” as he gave him the opportunity to “fullly cleanse” the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "islamization" of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the abolition of the headset prohibition for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The military and security forces are continuing.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered to fire more than 7395 state servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had shut down the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real lords of the country.
Three times they pushed by calling on their role as a guardian of the world's state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union.
Former officials say Erdogan is targeting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a named unnamed officer who, after the coup attempt, was seeking asylum from fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development could not make the NATO cold.
After the purification, there are doubts in the Alliance about the preparedness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational skills are “depleted,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. is issuing Green Cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to restore route for racing shuttle
It has been repeatedly discussed over the future of the racing shuttle in the past months - now it is to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is expected to be built on the maroden route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to ensure the future of the racing lift in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transportation, construction work on the track is expected to begin this year.
"With the decision to further order and repair the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country confesses itself to this link that is especially important for tourism," Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of restoration of the route was about 2.5 million euros.
The country will take over 75 percent of this amount.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally agreed, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen Rail as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“Therefore, the road plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated,” Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This means that the Race-steig shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.
In recent months, a pilot operation has been tested to see if the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also very constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes in fact.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the brush and the type of fingernails.
“People make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we’ll get to see them much more frequently,” Mr. Sharkey said at the publication of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their explosive partners to robots with a silicone hole that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything, from the eye color of the robot, the shape of the brushes to the type or color of his fingers.
But it’s becoming even more annoying as many robots have the “persons” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone hole.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as scaryness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which transmits the impression of shame and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventural" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible,” said True Companion’s website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her mood throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood!"
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allegations of rape, when you take a step on Frigid (here is: contradictory) Farrah, worries one most.
On his site, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men not have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their appearance and increasing refinance indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what passes through the edges can be very teaching about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has pledged to have sexual assaulted women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' (‘The Report of the Magd’) are not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the exhausted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, given the point, when it comes to their "persons", the robots do not represent real women.
You cannot separate from your companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are loving slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: servants
Trump’s great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the contents of healthy human mind.
It has become a binary knowledge of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. voters have also divided families in small information.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were in the U.S. newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's elected relatives.
We all allegedly struggle to let our filters break down.
Less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family with whom she has fought for politics for decades, is suddenly and strange on the same side.
This is a good thing about the table, but in another context, I remember that this also brings significant risks with it.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the detrimental effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we’re talking about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the terrible possibility that one day his butterflies will no longer disrupt us.
However, there is an even more scary long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly compared to his standards suddenly appear as a concept of reasoning.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s urcomic version of the madman – the dog on the car bag, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) – both of which, compared to Trump, actually occur as a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are dirty and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music transmits this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Fifty-three years later, and I’m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage – the theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count – but a large circular traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women can go on in the 40s and everyone has a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a shop, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the store table.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but it also exercises pressure on the server to bring the personality into a situation where no need is needed.
The poor woman in the shop stood apologizing laughing while I was tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with breast pain
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his gloves, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed Stone Camp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year imprisonment sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too cautious.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk of raising his punishment to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When the farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-classers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the dismissed students will go to high school, four to real school.
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public on Tuesday night at the Biesental House in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for the dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young noble who grows up in the chicken farm, but will then be released.
To this end, the muter shar performed a musical entitled "The Adler in the Chicken Farm".
The farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken cake, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke down, and the noble spread his wings out on a high mountain and escaped.
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The horse danced with the young gocks who wore cylinders to bet.
The noble stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
The young beast is different from the other young beasts, but they belong to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth-class student that he felt accepted in his new school.
Thanksgiving was followed to the colleagues, to the former school leader Michael Müller, who is repeatedly entering classes, and to the parents representatives.
The cooking time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She just dismissed her students after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the fourth class.
At the end, all the students sent a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal persons, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sithonia by the police.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The foreign ministry bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free camp and imposed significant fines to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What The Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel drivers be involved in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the review.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.
It is intended to improve the emission behavior of cars of Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4 diesel or worse is excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The compulsory updates before are only applicable to vehicles that have softwares,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their sub-equipment has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but no precise date yet.
Daimler has announced to write to all affected persons.
If any inspection is required, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the total removal last?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers do not voluntarily act on the environment until now."
How long will the update take?
The rearmament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get a date.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, according to Smetanin.
Is the price of Euro-4 cars threatened?
The ACE is afraid of that.
In the areas where driving prohibitions are threatened.
In rural areas there is no value loss for older diesel so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the wished awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be awarded at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the award.
The prize winner, announced by progressive TV series, Lear has already announced to refuse to participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to take away the means – and that burns me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her viewpoint.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital.
The previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living.
Roland Wacker, Haslach City Builder, will retire next year.
The job is already written out, but appropriate candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a City Builder.
And the work still makes him fun, as he tells in a press interview.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application so far meets the request profile.
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, having regard to the regular termination periods, there should be enough time for a processing.
Since Haslach operates as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the corresponding qualifications.
This function will be held by the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But civilian proximity is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating environment as well as good mood between the authority and the citizens.
For more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have been gathered, to which wakers look back with pride.
“We make the city worthy of life,” he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But also in the future, a variety of projects are on the agenda: the reconstruction of the former Hukla area and the downtown parking square are about to come.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
Only the latter will win with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“Everything in all awaits great tasks for my successor.
Work here is fun.”
There is a large space for a city building manager.
With Haslach’s own building and gardening, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the green facilities is often mentioned by citizens and visitors praising.
Since the Old Town as an Ensemble is under monumental protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits" when new buildings are approved, the distinctive city building manager emphasizes.
However, the city manager has a great responsibility.
He is the Builder, “At the end everything goes here over my table.”
In care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) has been there for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: “We’re looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay.”
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating environment, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who wish to apply to Roland Wacker should be able to demonstrate a graduate degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law.
The City Building Office is subject to high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business affairs, administration of urban legends, urban operating court with building and urban gardening, and the lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway blocked
According to the police, the previously unknown criminals had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of the Leobener Road (B116) to the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the nearby cargo had to be stopped.
Investigators are searching for two male assassins and they have been searching for them overnight.
Near the place of the incident, witnesses were observed by a pink rollers and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbubenstreik," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The murderer had put himself in great danger and also threatened the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lock and the facility, as well as the delays and the costs for the rail compensation transport could also be paid to the offenders.
In total, it is expected to be a "significant" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaid on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the Southern Railway route could be conducted without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains were crashed on Friday afternoon, two of which concerned remote traffic.
The goods did not go out, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of top lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masters were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealed condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and vomiting, recurring or bloodshed, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
In experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their injections.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the structures of proteins – to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milk when the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctorand Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was but housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The worms of the mice were DNA-sequenced and there were six bacterial species found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missed in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they didn’t develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to unmatched immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleansed from the liquid, it proved to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the levels of tryptophan were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal trajects.
It is not known whether tryptophan subproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in the genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho after the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced by preference.
However, Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asian Blues tournament and only achieved 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him to be ready earlier than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments, but he insisted that the club has already done a "fantasy job" to fulfill three of his four priority commitments.
“To get three out of four, I thank the team for it,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve made a lot of effort.”
Boeing “malt” Dreamliner in the sky
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the roadsharms was to be the form of a Dreamliner.
It was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was the leader of the SPD, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just no fire from the party center, just no counterwind from the federation – so was the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, it has changed substantially.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt House have watched the events in the SPD-guided country capitals with increasing anger.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a deep blow.
And one after the other.
The Federal CDU sees after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green can simply not rule reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told Germany's editorial network (RND).
The surprising party departure of a Greens has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary election, its red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Green Federation’s chief executive Michael Kellner has called on the decayed lower-Saxon Green deputy Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter’s will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return its mandate,” the Federal Executive Officer and Electoral Campaign Officer of the Greens told Redactionsnetwerk Deutschland (RND).
"That can't all be true," a SPD voter tightened when the new Hiob message arrived at the party center on Friday afternoon.
Stephan Weil, the Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the green members Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries associations.
And no one knows what’s next.
The misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the companions of the time.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It also happened, and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD to the turmoil, the Düsseldorf-Pleite gladly overthrowed the party.
The fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow.
Then, when they just had created new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next depth.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD countryside, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication afterwards he did so much wrong what one can do wrong.
Since then Scholz has been struggling for his political survival.
And then Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW gas issue and its role in the Supervisory Council, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Miese survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or just that’s why, because in the past weeks, it has been increasingly trying to put accents in the Bund.
The attempt of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden even to his fellow members around Martin Schulz.
They gave it because they promised a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In this case, because of the party-internal swist of the Lower Saxony Greens, it is essentially not guilty.
But Schulz is not.
Sometimes, therefore, the colleagues try to keep their own rows closed.
Their anger focuses on the Greens, and here above all on the abstract parliamentary Twesten.
“It’s unbearable and democratically damaging how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party in the SPD-Bundestags fraction, to the RedactionsNetwork Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her personality as a direct candidate, but on the list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony deputy continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, the head of the SPD-Bundestag faction, complained of a "undemocratic maneuver".
“The voting will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister,” Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election, says to the RND.
“Now the personal career disappointment of a future CDU member falsifies the election result,” Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further promises from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for local sector III
Those who want to repair their home in the years can soon get support from the country.
This was by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back on what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in the reception areas.
At that time, in the Renewal Area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funds.
In the repair area II from 2005 to 2016, the grants were still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote internal development, and not just to open new building areas.
On April 4th, the government office of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros come from the country, the rest received from the municipality.
How to create a repair area?
We will, according to Schindler, explore where the “real old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in repair in the planned area.
If necessary, the territory boundaries could be delayed again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal country program "Social City", within which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on the object, i.e. per land.
The sanitation area would then be defined as a statutory.
The approval period for the funds will continue from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the recording will be carried out for the first time, in the framework of which the participants in the sanitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the constitutional decision should be made as far as possible, so that the renovations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality should carry out the aforementioned investigations.
It is about evaluating urban structural disorders and deciding when it will be recovered and to what extent.
There will also be a recovery note in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to receptions again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that an important success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent by post to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Book", which is among other things about the state of construction and the plans for restoration.
In the gray questionnaire, the "House and Household Book", details can be made about size, division and residents of a living room.
The blue "business book" is only to fill out when business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it is to be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funds.
Furthermore, new measures are not susceptible to support.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the funds will function according to the "wind dog principle" - whoever comes first, must first.
You can’t “reserve” funds for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Local II" were shown to make the presents a "smackful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between his finger and finger, and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined with Dr. Geoff Watson, a advising anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional price of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is on the drive.
The White House advertising costs the taxpayer thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi rubber.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote in the evening of the event to his head, the vice-marine commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 15 p.m. on July 17 at 7 p.m. and remained so long until the grass was stained between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours, a second crew would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’re closed,” the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was called an official event by the White House and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political top tones.
At the event, the President encouraged the reform of the health reform that was ongoing in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to undermine government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the President's aircraft performed taxi services in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made in America" - the shows of products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 installations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to set down the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the air crew for the month, a official said.
Helicopter units flew additional 11 hours on that day for "non-Presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in delivering the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense hour rates for the 2017 budget year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“The cost for taxpayers to determine on the basis of the estimates for the reimbursement rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs for fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have untouched.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and laughed with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
TC BW Neuss in front of a hard task
The top rider of the Second Tennis League takes place at the tabellendress Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. in Kiel at the tabellendress Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches still unmatched balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations.
At the back, I think the team is very good.”
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are primarily concerned.
“These Danish and Finnish can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It will be difficult for us as always.
You need a good portion of happiness.”
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime January.
If the currently still at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make the active French to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will come to his first match in this season.
The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world list in January 2016, someone from the trainer board around Marius Zay fills up the frame.
How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed his signature under the law to strengthen sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
“In his harvest to adopt the law,” the Congress has packed in a few “non-constitutional regulations,” he said.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shamed against the U.S. government.
After all, the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
This is concerned since then by investors of the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Headquarters Nord Stream 2.
The drohkulisse is huge.
However, it is too early for an estimation of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to revive the sanctions by an Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are available for him.
The press has looked at which of the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put in the heart of Netflix's heat series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s Killer, Netflix’s series is not over for a long time.
The stages three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has directed its attention to the richest drug trade organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Leaded by four powerful paths, they operate “like a Fortune-500 company” only with more state damages and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites U.S. and Colombian criminal proceedings to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Role Backward: The City Launches 46 Kitchen Helps
The city organizes the Kita-Midnight Table again.
With fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the towns.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban children’s day facilities (Kitas) again in its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director in the youth aid sector, this is a good news: “We are all very happy.”
Cooking continues out of the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked cooled.
The city operates 46 children’s dayrooms in the Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
Over the past year, 2,800 children were sitting on the tables, and the demand is growing.
“In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating in the kitto for lunch,” Pommeranz explains.
“The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14:00.”
From 1 September, part-time staff have kitchen service: they heat the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, donate the meal individually, give the food out, wash out, wash and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a kit,” Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour range.
“The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team,” Pommeranz says satisfied.
"Therefore they are much stronger connected and it is easier for the kitale management to implement educational concepts."
It is also about healthy food and cooking.
“Children should help prepare food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaningful.
Also for the children.
“They have a known strength in the kit, a person that is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kit rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, the charm it has shown itself as the most economical in the cost comparison between own management and foreign provision for the city, the press office says.
And that, though 46 part-time forces are resettled.
“But these hours are not so heavy for about 750 people in the educational area,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can be representative only if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Executive Director of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the provincial council elections. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative and credible only if women are entirely involved and engaged in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against a electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat actions to a advisory role.
This year, the elections will for the first time peacefully transfer power from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.

Men are trying to catch a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were alleged to have tried to steal a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who stayed with friends on the Kolping Street, around 14.55 p.m., because they wanted to call the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
After that, one of the murderers tried to catch the girl’s cell phone and neck chain, which, however, failed.
Unfortunately the duo escaped.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.

GMB’s report on investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure to the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company has silenced about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, along with other products, makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cakes.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade unions would “be the first to experience” if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company’s affiliate chief, GMB Scotland McVitie’s called for “to express concerns that the financing for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses strongly on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in a high unemployment and social disadvantage area.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’s affiliate leader has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade unions.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with our employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic environment, are continuously reviewing our business – and that applies to all of our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “In the last years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site.If our operating processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this.”
PSG has warned Barcelona of Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fall behind in her pursuit of Neymar after she gave an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than a double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan government claims that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City announced interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any team who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll stand in opposition to them, we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish team expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
Roller shattered and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown murderer deliberately shot down a roller placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30, causing damages of over 200 euros to the vehicle's clothes.
The police of Schramberg, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are searching for witnesses for an accident on the B215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to him on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the guidelines.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW were traveling in direction of Leese around 19.55 p.m. on the B215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of the tour of Stolzenau, a truck met him on his track, so he had to escape to the right.
During this time, the Touran driver touched the lineboard.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had crossed a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
Police are now asking the witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the causing vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau by tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report releases Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses releases Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to encourage discussions.
Christian Weisnder, a spokesman for the Reform Movement "We are the Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an excuse from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the Catholic Church’s reputation if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets for their own negligence or their then wrong assessment of the actions.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized, however, that the reporting of violence among the dogs was measured by "two-dimensional" measures.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a "destructive and shameful act" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is noticeable, says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to consider it normal,” writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian radio: “You like to go to the church and this is a found meal.”
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “strikes were a very normal educational means” to “to deal with ugly children like I was one.”
They found it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases often appeared the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all of this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report that was submitted by the Bishop of Regensburg’s lawyer Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburg dompats were "with high plausibility" victims of aggression between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 dompats sexually abused.
In the conclusive report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: “In summary, it can be stated that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases applied forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it occurs that many victims appreciate R.’s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, according to his opinion, dismisses.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence exercises against protective persons at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a controversial image of the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
First, many students highlight their “humanity”.
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became hands-on when a housepiece musically did not bring top performance.
How do you, as a biographer, appreciate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated, and he is clearly released from any suspicion of mediation or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violent processes at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effect.
In any case, you can accuse him of getting to know it too late or not taking the first statements seriously enough.
The temple gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by practically all the respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presented a very excellent testimony, describing him as "heat-hearted", "loved", "righteous", "competent" and "comprehensible", as an extremely gentle teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, cakes and candy, and "always covered by children's grapes".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which once led to anger.
The fact that he not only knocked with chairs and throwed the key bond on the ground, but also distributed ears and pulled too fragile boys to his hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know these methods of punishment?
Of course, I think of all of us who were born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldwide school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually about in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violent courses at school, this is obviously bagatellus.
There is a question of whether it does not have to do with his well-knownness and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media are just falling on him.
In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still delighted.
But the truth is: the report releases Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot has been in connection with the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any processing or co-consciousness in relation to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the captain.
Even the parents were not enthusiastic.
“I’ve never married myself to talk about this with my father or mother,” one of the victims said, “I’ve been very embarrassed.”
The real problem in the disclosure of sexual abuse was and is that most victims lie out of shame.
If they were not even entrusted to their parents and sisters, then not to a chairman who would have been professionally somewhat a colleague of the criminals.
How do Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger assess the role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student formulated it as follows: “About sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective criminal.
I think it is ... even really absurd to admit that just for him ... babies have been more intriguing or clearly or even more open than their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you’re talking to him about sex is unimaginable.”
So the report comes to the very clear outcome: “The fact that the student and/or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation.”
As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of speech from any companion.
So he cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the manifestation.
Therefore, there is also no reason to link his good name with these reverse crimes, as unfortunately in some cases.
In the media there was a lot to read about "Gewaltexessen" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegsehen".
Should he live with that accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
It is clearly separated: between the pre-school and high school, between sexual abuse and violence and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report addresses incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chore leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible prayer education, the cases in which boys were righteously shaken and painted by sadist teachers, and terribly lie among them, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have dominated.
But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys to face only when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "pre-school" was tabu.
One was just happy to be escaped from her and so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different in the high school?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but not sadist violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that “many victims appreciate R.’s general humanity and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even link positive memories with him.”
It remains, above all, the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was by the state at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71 when he just began to establish himself, and of the events at a school where he was just not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out that “the practitioner punishment continues to be practiced in the pre-school.”
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when the penalties were forbidden in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that they occurred in a legal grey zone, as we all probably know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.
You can’t say that he’s always looked away.
That simply isn’t true.
Only in 1980 the penalty was officially abolished on schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said it was unfair to apply the current educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “fallstrick of Anachronism,” that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was disgraceful, and not to what was interrupted in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children’s souls, which is far beyond the usual at that time.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally done.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplination and punishment, i.e. ear feeding and pulling on the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
As physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger played in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Was the subject of punishment also concerned?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, speaks from his perspective, then the dogs only played a side role.
However, I do not hesitate that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form from the so far more nationally known Regensburg Domspats an institution of world-trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tours twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and in Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cakes and bonbons alone, you do not become a great singer and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion, and self-conquer.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply faithful and heart-good people, of whom you can’t imagine that he could do something good even for a fly.
I get regularly with how many former domestic dogs still today, 23 years after his emergency, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most dogs are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher—a strict father, of course, that may be—but still a loving respectful person, to whom they still look today and whom they just adore.
And please, again very clearly: all that is accused of is the educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is extremely unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a even more prominent brother to make the media sins.
The evil intention behind it is just too obvious.
For the report that was just published, releases him.
Now the honor would be to let a 93-year-old man, who has gained great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.
