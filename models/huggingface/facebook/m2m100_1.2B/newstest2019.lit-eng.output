MG Baltic case: Gustain’s new lawyer says he has not yet been able to access the case
On Monday, the eleventh hearing of the MG Baltic case court was attended by all the defendants: Sharūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the accused.
At the last court hearing, the new lawyer appointed by the state, Alexander Dorošev, told the judges' college that he had not yet come to know the case material.
Linas Belevičius, a lawyer at MG Baltic, then stated that in order to ensure the full defense of the individual, the judges’ board must allow the new lawyer access to the case material and requested to postpone the hearing.
In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the criminal file.
This is not just a formal session,” said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroševas, noted that he was unable to get acquainted with neither the accused act nor the entire file of the case.
Earlier, in the previous court hearing, the suspect Gustain said he had given up his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard during the meeting.
The lawyers of the accused said that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The law enforcement agency suspects that politicians, taking bribery from MG Baltic, supported or initiated favourable decisions in the Seimas and other state institutions, and also influenced in determining the winners of public procurement.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 people were questioned, including more than 50 members of the previous and current Seimas, several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches were conducted.
Gustainis is suspected of receiving more than 8 thousand euros, Steponavičius – 15 thousand euros, Gapšys – more than 27 thousand euros, and Masiulis is suspected of taking more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trafficking in influence, the Liberal Movement - bribery, trafficking in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of purchasing and trafficking in influence by these parties.
It is suspected that politicians discussed bribery with MG Baltic vice president R. Kurlianski, and subsequently in the Seimas or other institutions suggested or supported initiatives favourable to the group.
Ethics Guards: Liberal Movement Board on Vilnius Department’s Action Right
"The decisions made by the government are in accordance with the statutes," Vytautas Tamošiūnas, the head of the commission, told BNS after the meeting.
“Our decision was not new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when the issue of Pages and Utenas was raised.
According to the statutes, this is a matter of competence.
And if the board of directors decides that some department can do what it wants, go with the committee and the board of directors agrees, then the department can go, but if the board of directors decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision that all departments form party lists.
And if it does not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend the membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamošūns, the party’s governing board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the party revoked the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in the municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with the newly formed election committee.
According to the Party Board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the party, the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius department had to cancel its aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the chapter did not.
The former head of the department parliamentary Aušrinė Armonaitė has already retired from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to pursue another term as head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, we are proud of!"
He also left the party.
The municipal councils and mayoral elections will be held next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger on a tractor that had previously crushed a man, officials said on Monday.
Forests officer Mahavir Kaujlagis said that after the tiger crushed a man who worked in the field late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female tried to escape, carried it with a tractor.
The inhabitants say that this tiger also attacked and wrecked one young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in the Lakhympur Khery district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Hunting tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Reserve Director Ramesh Pandey said the case would be to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh, villagers beat another tiger; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Protection Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year’s government data showed that at least one person per day was killed in clashes with wild tigers or elephants over the past three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection program that established reserve areas in national parks and began to criminalize the slaughter of big cats.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, the censuses suggest that the then population of about 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Cats and dogs must be labelled with microchips
The chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which proposes mandatory marking cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that cats and dogs should be mandatory labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and labelling would be organized by the local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs and cats will be labelled free of charge by state funds, and in 2020, there will be no worries for the population and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding,” said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments aim to address the systemic need for domestic animal labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that, according to the estimated average cost of providing the microchip and service, which will be around 5 euros, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pets can reach up to 6 million euros.
The funding needs are planned to be distributed over three years and will amount to 2 million euros annually.
It is expected that funds for labelling programs will be allocated through the Special Programme for Supporting the Environment of Municipalities, whose revenue will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
These funds will be able to be used not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all countries of the European Union, it allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost animals can be easily returned to the owners), and saves the time of the farmers themselves, when the search for the fugitive and misguided pet has to spend a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only labelled pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling obliges to take responsibly care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling had raised resistance, as the relevant programmes were proposed to be funded by the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental support program and the right to label by giving not only veterinarians, but also civil servants, i.e. people in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing various Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government troops killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.

"Morning" extended a help hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be played in Vilnius, where Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The match will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius "Rytas", whichins warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will already on November 7th under its roof in the "Ryto" arena receive the Cherkasi "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Pristina "KB Prishtina" teams.

“We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be an honor for us to play here.
Hopefully we will get support from the local people.
The Kosovo team was not allowed to enter Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.

Basketball fans will be able to enter the match free of charge on Wednesday, and the match starts at 7 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star actress B. Arsobaite is chased for lies
It is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaite has been given roles related to liars on several occasions.
First the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Lie" and finally the comedy "Lie".
In this film, Brigita plays the playful wife of Songis Kazlausko's hero.
“I really liked filming in Melagi because I’m more a theatre actress and rarely appear in theaters.
The team has promised an excellent result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I’ve never been fascinated by those little, decorative four-five.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully," she smiled.
In the comic and intriguing peripeties of the family members, the new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" has been introduced from the first minutes, produced by the producer of the Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "Between us, boys ..." Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your girlfriend has just announced – she’s waiting.
It would be great news, only...your beloved is your brother’s wife!
But that is not all.
Without announcing the "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holiday of the year – Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such an atomic blow.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobaite’s comedy “Melagiai” a good mood will be presented to the audience by four-generation film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "The Lies" in cinemas from November 9th.
It will decide whether to write off 100 million euros of unpaid taxes for migrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted the amendment to the Residence Declaration Act prepared by the leader of the "peasants" Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 Seimas members voted for, 9 voted against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue to consider the amendments on December 6 or later, upon receipt of the Government's conclusion.
According to Karbauskis, these contributions are counted for people who have not declared leaving Lithuania.
According to the parliamentary, in three years one person does not pay about 1 000 euros, and now there are about 100 000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "encourage some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be counted.
Conservative member of the Health Affairs Committee, Antanas Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance tax – they are provided with the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments stipulate that those who leave Lithuania will be considered as people who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and SODRA will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of “Sodra”, has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of people who have emigrated and the activities of “Sodra”.
A video on the internet about a sliding bear reveals a serious problem
It is like a mother bear climbing on a steep snowed slope, while the little one climbs, slides down and climbs persistently again.
The video has received a lot of reviews and comments.
People admired the little bear's persistence - several times sliding down, he again climbed to his mother.
He does not succeed from the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is a matter of attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
“I think the bear drone was terrified.
Their movements show that they are in panic.
If the drone did not fly around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or overtaken it more slowly or cautiously.
It’s a great example of how drones shouldn’t be used,” ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
A while ago, Ditmer and his colleagues investigated how drones affect bears.
Animals were adapted to heart work meters.
As the drone approached, some of the bears fled, others fled nowhere, but the hearts of all of them started beating more frequently.
Scientists advise drones to be used responsibly for filming animals, not to fly too close, not to make noise, and not to fly where it is forbidden.
Addressed by the President in a newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to attend the trial on his alleged treason in an unusual manner, a summons announced in the official newspaper.
In the appeal, published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoy Courier", the former leader is invited to attend the criminal trial hearing on November 19, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to participate in the hearing via video communication.
On October 30, the Kyiv court ruled that the debate in the case of Yanukovych had ended.
Yanukovych’s lawyer, Alexander Goroshensky, who works in Russia, was given the opportunity to register with the Register of Foreign Lawyers until November 19, so that he could attend the hearing, where Yanukovych is expected to say his last word via video.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association treaty with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and a war broke out in the eastern part of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people despite numerous efforts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.
The list of Conservatives to the Vilnius City Council will be led by Valdas Benkunskas
The conservative candidate for the year was already approved by former minister of economy, parliamentarian Dainius Kreivys.
During the Conservative primary elections this weekend, party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipal Council.
As by the party, the leader of the Conservative list was V. Benkunskas, the chairman of the Vilnius Conference of Sections of the TS-LKD.
The top ten candidates included Vilnius City Municipal Council members Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Seimas member Lutauras Kazlavickas, Young Conservatives League chairman Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Appeal to the Constitutional Court on restrictions on cogeneration power plants
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) the decision of the rulers to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste-burning power plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Parliamentary Party of the Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) that a group of members of the Seimas appealed to the Supreme Court, asking to investigate the conformity of amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by the rulers with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration plants already underway, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential territory) on the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas before the entry into force of the law," the statement said.
Parliamentarians note that taking into account the way in which the law formulates the prohibition to build objects of state importance for waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of "residential territory" is defined), it should be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately limits or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the burning of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of Lithuania's population in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects throughout the country.
The appeal states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
The CC has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards, based on an undefined criterion.
The establishment of such legal regulation violated the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate confidence, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
If the projects were stopped, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses would also be suffered by Lithuanian residents - heating prices would increase, environmental pollution would increase due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal was signed by members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Deputy Senior of the Liberal Movement, Social Democrats and the ruling Social Democrats Working Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject the veto of President Dalia Grybauskaitė on amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provide the government's right to halt the construction of cogeneration power plants already started, and established a "quarantine" zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law repeatedly adopted by the Seimas will come into force from January 1, 2019, but the rulers already propose to abandon the 20 km restriction.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed in the autumn session.
However, the government’s right to halt projects that have already begun is not planned.
The case will be handled in order, not earlier than in a year.
LeBron James' Statistics for Lakers
LeBron James’ start-up career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped spark rumors about a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were reassured by Basketball Operations President Magic Johnson, who said that he would not forgive the coach, but the game needs to be better.
The team’s biggest star, L. James, should also turn to himself.
Although the statistics of the attacker are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 recovered balls and 7.7 scoring passes.
But it does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures have emerged, showing Lakers are playing better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
The attacker is disadvantaged by +/- statistics, showing how many more points a team scores or misses when certain players are on the pitch.
That’s when L. James is on the pitch, Lakers lost 30 points more than their rivals this season.
In his seat on the bench, the Lakers earned 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers are currently in only 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn everything up.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania highly appreciates Spain’s cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region,” said Minister Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already conducted five NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, including three in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Šiauliai was in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that there are regular consultations between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius in 2004, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On October 29, Jose Maria Robles Fraga delivered his letter of dismissal to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
Achenne on arrest: I believe in the innocence of the man and the law enforcement
"It was the most unexpected thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the agencies probably do the work they have to do.
Each of us does our work.
I trust the law enforcement, I trust my husband that everything is right and honest, that no unfair actions should be done,” Ačienė told BNS.
Acho was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still a director of the administration of the municipality of Raseinių, took a high-value bribe, and in exchange could have created exceptional conditions for a private company, which has signed a contract with the municipality-controlled Raseinių buses park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly buying Acha or participating in the masking of bribery with various financial transactions.
Raseinių district municipal council resigned Aczu from the post of head of the administration in April this year for the third attempt after a statement of mistrust.
In March of this year, he became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gedimino Kirkil, he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
Ačas failed in the mayoral election a few years ago as a representative of the electoral committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in Raseinių mayoral elections next year, but has not yet decided whether or not to participate in municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement action - it will depend on whether she will withdraw from the work commission.
“I don’t make any sudden decisions today, I think I’ll make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need, what accusations are raised, of course, I will make one or the other decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again – time will put everything in its place,” she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition Conservatives in the Seimas, urged Seimas Chairman Viktor Pranckietis and the leader of the "peasants" Ramūnus Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, transferring her to work in another Seimas committee or commission.
She said that the further work of Ačiene in the anti-corruption commission of the Seimas "would cause public-based distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission."
Coldplay’s music has also attracted Lithuanian couples.
On Monday night, a number of music and film lovers attended the premiere of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of the most popular pop rock bands in Britain, Coldplay, which intersect with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band guys when they were still playing in bars and gathered just a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see untold footage from behind-the-scenes concerts, rehearsals or leisure time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and founded the band Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first record, Safety, which included three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, while only 50 copies of Safety went on sale.
Now Coldplay is a world-renowned, respected and beloved band with seven albums sold in more than 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 different awards, including nine British Awards and seven Grammy Awards.

Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favorable investment environment for EU
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favorable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Grybauskaitė stressed that in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "join efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", addressing the fundamental causes of trade wars-induced tensions, "excess production and unfair competition".
“China’s commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important to the European Union, which is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskaitė said.
According to her, China’s opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for the country’s global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that investment transparency must be “above the interests of any business group.”
“Transparency, the rule of law, strict observance of international treaties – this must be essential to the environment of new investment relations,” Grybauskaitė said.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to soften criticism that avoids opening its market and protects only its.
The exhibition is attended by heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50 percent, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investments in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing’s exclusive attention to Eastern Europe divides the unity of the EU.
Disadvantages resolved: Mobile signature service is already operational
The mobile signature provider, the Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, reports that the failure in the mobile signature system has been removed and the service is operating as normal.
The mobile signature was restarted at 14:28 p.m.

Lion Air plane crash: relatives angry
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air aircraft indicates that there has been a speed meter failure in at least four of its last flights, investigators said on Monday.
National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) Chairman Soerjanto Tajjono said a similar hurricane occurred during the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fatal one when the aircraft crashed in the Sea of Java on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board died in the crash.
Many media trouble during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tajjono said at a news conference.
"Data from the black box showed that two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta also had the same problem," he added.
There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to clarify that the black box (resided data) about four flights, during which there were problems with the air speed meter," said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with the families of the victims, Tajjono said that the information on the flight recording device corresponds to reports that the aircraft's speed and altitude changed irregularly after its last flight.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations after a technical failure was detected on a flight from Bali to Jakarta.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, who moderated a family meeting with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the disaster investigation.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and upset family members demanded that Kirana, who founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, show up.
Lion Air behaved inappropriately," said one man, who portrayed himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
"Lion Air has never contacted me since the start of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed no sympathy for us."
After the meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of identifying the deceased.
Nearly 140 body bags loaded with human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the two-month-old airliner was allowed to fly, despite a failure on the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which caused passengers to fear a sudden crash immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said the failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
If not, the relevant technicians must be prosecuted.
The law was very clear, not they claimed that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians have to respond under the law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a relatively small area suggests that the aircraft probably crashed into the water while flying at very high speeds.
“The plane was solid when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, operated at high turns - this is indicated by all the broken turbine spikes," the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medano, killing 234 people.
After the crash, rescue workers led: a minor was also injured
On Monday night on the road to Vėžaičiai - Plungė, near Tilvika, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided.
Vehicles collided, three people were injured.
It is that a BMW driver, born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the traffic and the shooter crashed into a Mercedes-Benz car, which ran a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firefighters.
A Mercedes-Benz girl has been hit by teeth in an accident.
All victims are taken to the hospital.
There is no need for artificial facilitation of the referendum.
After the Seimas approved the proposal of the rulers to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution.
This and its amendment, especially of the articles in its first section, should not be a minor majority.
It is not difficult to predict that the president would indeed veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė, an internal policy adviser, told the news station on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, so reducing the number of votes needed to replace these articles, according to Mr. Linge, would create a "negative precedent" and "convert into an uncontrollable risk".
“The president believes there is no need for any artificial relief, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more need for dialogue with the people,” he said.
The parliament is scheduled to vote on the amendment to the referendum law on Tuesday.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Section 1 and Section 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote approve it in a referendum.
Currently, articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution can be replaced by a referendum by more than half of all voting citizens.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania have the right to vote: half would have 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - a million voters.
This proposal came after the Seimas in September approved the president’s veto on earlier parliamentary amendments that eased the requirements for votes in the first section of Article 12 of the Constitution, which defines the number of votes in changing citizenship.
The cartel for the referendum is proposed to be reduced in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are scheduled.
Emigrants after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990 can now, with some exceptions, not have dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community in the world is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum would not take place - not enough people would come to vote.
Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are “braška”, so they need to be renovated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is beginning to crumble, so it needs to be renewed, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of the Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already on the ground because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew the Vilnius airport - this does not even fall into the long-distance planning, this is the minimum we must do," Masiulis said at a communication conference held by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "State" on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be especially important, because important projects will have to be implemented - completed "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built the external port of Klaipeda, renovated the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, and possibly a new airport.
“The next decade will be very important – we must complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, arrange the airports, decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not fall asleep, we must start projects now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,” he said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that in recent years, too little money has been spent on road maintenance.
“The situation has not improved because there are not enough funds.
We are speculating on building new roads, but even for the minimum maintenance, for example, on highways, the funds are lacking.
We must determine the amount that should be spent on the maintenance of roads if we want their condition to improve,” Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuania’s exports of services in the transport sector grew 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, surpassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis has again criticized the European Commission’s proposal that EU carriers will be obliged to periodically return their trucks to the country of registration.
“We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, it is absurd to suggest that trucks go back home continuously, because empty trucks would drive in Europe, burn fuel, and increase emissions.
Railways will benefit mostly from this, as costs will rise to the extent that part of transport will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transportation, the transport sector creates 12.2%.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with heritage defenders
Last week, Mr. Masiulis told the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called the considerations of Mr. Masiulio political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1960s is a value registered in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"Taking that old terminal out of the heritage would be a politically important step, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal could be built, so that after entering Vilnius you would feel like a modern country, not such an interesting country that really does not represent our country as innovative," Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also that in Kaunas it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and connect the airport with Rail Baltica by building a subway station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, and next year - 5 million.
The airport served 1.2 million passengers last year.

Direct flights to Madagascar will start next year
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger aircraft flying on regular flights, Boeing 767 will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, based on the information of the tour operator "Itaka Lietuva", writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
Passengers will be able to choose between 259 seats in the economy class and 8 seats in the business class.
The new holiday destination will be accessible directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Managing Director of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new vacation destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new vacation destinations for the 2019 summer season.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on possible crisis: it is important not to talk about disease
We always have to prepare for difficult times.
What I want to rejoice is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease," she said during her visit to Brussels on Monday.
On Monday and Tuesday, Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance Miglė Tuskienė will attend the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenue from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission.
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft budget as not in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has taken advantage of this opportunity.
More information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibilities for the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is believed that the ESM’s functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the ESM’s and other EU institutions’ functions.

Lithuanian traditions and customs
It has recently been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and landscape scholar Balio Buračo (1897-1972) in Sidaros, Šiaulėnas County, the then Šiauliai province.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-filled national rebirth called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Bronių - from the depths of the countryside to all the creative can engage in the cultivation, meaningfulness and preservation of our cultural traditions.
During more than 50 years of travelling around his homeland with a camera in his hands, Balys Burač provided a broad and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly decaying branches of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the lasting value of his work.
In Bali’s photographs of Lithuanian landscape, castle mountains, eternalized in the everyday and festive environment, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a considerable part of the heritage of Bali Burach, dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is especially rich in descriptions of the works of interwar Žemaitija, especially of the Kupiškėns, Šiaulėns, Telšiški, as well as the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkia, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Bali Burač.
Of the approximately 10,000 remaining negatives stored in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished photographs have been selected for this publication, which are grouped by selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of the Kupiškėns, dzūkas, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.
A suspect who escaped from a police car was released for four hours.
How the young man (born in 1994) managed to escape from a service car, the police do not yet disclose.
He was arrested on suspicion of theft.
At around 4 p.m., the police distributed a photo of the fugitive and appealed to the public asking for help: "Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994), a birzhi suspect, escaped from the service car.
The man fled with his armor.
If you notice this person, please call 112 or 8700 60000.

The police department said: "The suspect has been detained in Panevėžys, he is facing another case for trying to escape.
Thanks to everyone for the help.
The couple died just hours after their marriage.
A helicopter crash in the southwestern state of Texas killed a newlyweds couple just hours earlier.
24-year-old William Troy's Byler and his co-wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 kilometers northwest of Juvaldi and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident occurred after flying about 24 kilometers, exactly as many as the newlyweds were.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Samo Houston State University in Hantsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Billers ranch near Yuvaldis and flew out on a family-owned helicopter after the wedding celebration.
The accident occurred while the helicopter flew about 24 kilometers.
The newlyweds flew to the international airport of Sant Antoni, where they planned to board the plane and fly for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
"It's a very rocky area with an uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Lawrence piloted the family aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot’s physical condition was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after taking off.
Its debris flooded a wide range on a rocky slope of a hill and the body remained “dangerously hanging,” aviation safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to remove the debris and then examine it in depth, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach that spot, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and the NTSB's preliminary report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Calls New Sanctions on Iran a “Historic Day”
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of parliament of his Likud party, his office said.
“Today is the day when, under President Trump, the United States is imposing tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran ever since efforts to curb its aggression began,” he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would be a “decisive” blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions ever", came into effect in May following Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from the global nuclear deal with Tehran.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran’s oil exports, which have dropped by about one million barrels a day since May, and to deter Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran, saying its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is concerned about Iran’s actions in neighbouring Syria and has pledged not to allow it to establish itself there militarily.
Other parties to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – disagree with the U.S. decision and say the agreement, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is investigating the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist.
In the case that ended with the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern town, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The district court of Vilnius decided on Tuesday that in order to clarify all relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be heard at the next hearing on November 26.
In this case, an absolute sentence has already been issued, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On August 22, the district court of the city of Vilnius justified the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office asks the district court to repeal the judgment of the district court and says that the biggest fault for the accident lies with Osipov, and the district court’s conclusions are unfounded.
The abolition of the sentence is also requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015 at about 15 a.m., when a car "Škoda Fabia" driven by Osipov entered the Yirmūnų street from Lakūnų street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor accused the man that the driver of the car violated the Road Traffic Rules, which provided for giving the road, and caused a traffic accident - a man who was driving a motorcycle "Piaggo" on the main road died.
Initial police reports indicated that the motorcycle driver was killed, but later investigations found that the vehicle was compared to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, a judge at the Vilnius city district court, told BNS that experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed in that place was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the old driver claimed to have driven at a speed of only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The motorcycle driver, who saw the obstacle, tried to brake and fell from the vehicle before colliding with a Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor believes that Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, was supposed to give way to a motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead are five Syrian soldiers and six members of the military company Vagner.
This was by a source in the Syrian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Army Corps is deployed in the area, with a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries" joining it.
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
Former King of Belgium to take paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking to be recognized as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to RTBF, he may appeal to the Supreme Court for opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel – the former husband of Delphine’s mother – is neither biologically nor legally the artist’s father.
Delphine appealed for the relevant investigation in order to recognize the "true" father's daughter Albert.
The Socialist Party will give money to parties but will not give anything to social workers.
This week, the Central Election Commission (CEC) will allocate a budget subsidy of almost 3 million euros to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by Deputy Speaker Gediminas Kirkil, which was established this spring, has not yet been expected to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the ICC, if the legal environment that regulates the distribution of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, Chairman of the ICC, informed the VZ that "this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the distribution of the budget half-year subsidy to the parties".
According to him, a decision on this issue must be made by November 15.
EUR 2,751 million will be allocated to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Fatherland Union-Lithuanian Christians Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million Euros, the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens - about 0.55 million Euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million Euros, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost 0.4 million Euros, the Labour Party without a faction in the Seimas - about 0.23 million Euros, the recently joined to the ruling Party of Order and Justice - almost 0.22 million Euros, represented in parliament, but neither ruling nor oppositionally unproclaimed Polish Election Action-Union of Christian Families - about 0.18 million Euros.
In accordance with the current law, which will be guided by the VRK, the distribution of budget money will be granted to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers will receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the near future three elections - municipality, president and European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the Political Parties and this year’s budget laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but government representatives Mr. Kirkilas and peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis assure that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be done until the meeting of the ICC on Thursday, so according to Matjošaitytė, "the subsidies will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far."
It is true that the head of the ICC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the president’s veto this or next week and the new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties came into force, a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, could be considered in the commission.
"We will take the entire legal environment into account when making the decision, as we are the enforcement authority that has to implement the laws that are being passed," she said.
If the Seimas could reject the veto and the new laws entered into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties according to them, having borrowed the corresponding amounts.
The subsidies already distributed to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: Attorneys to murder activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be examined very carefully in accordance with the examination procedures.
As president, I have no opportunity and no need to obtain information that could hinder the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way can we find out the truth and punish evil,” Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most of all interested in clarifying Handziuk’s murder, and that the murderers, organizers and sponsors “take the necessary responsibility.”
“After this case has been reclassified as a murder case, they are rightly and reasonably facing life imprisonment,” the Ukrainian president said.
He called correct the public’s demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are."
He also said that political speculation on the subject will not help to clarify the situation, but will confuse everything even more.
"I urge all, both the authorities and the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, God, not to use this murder for public relations," he said.
On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast – so as to raise public confidence.
There is simply no other way.”
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he said.
Handziuk, an anti-corruption activist, was attacked and acidified in the city of Cherson in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but died in the hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko delivered a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, authorities were accused by public activists of failing to conduct an investigation properly.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Interior Minister.
"Today I am submitting my resignation statement," Lucenka told parliamentarians while reading her investigative report.
Parliament still has to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk’s murder.
Bill Gates launches toilet without water
In introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from conventional to no water supply to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn't need water in the pipes at a show in Beijing, Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates told Bloomberg.
The technology toilet was created with funding from a charity founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
For seven years, the fund spent $200 million working on a facility that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now ready and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation.
Fighting poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already reaches 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a bottle of feces in a toilet presentation.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small sample "can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100 thousand eggs of worm parasites."
S. Slyva elected president of the mass football association
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian mass football association was held in Kaunas, where Sergey Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Following the request received by Anatoly Stechenko to resign from the office of president of the association, an extraordinary general meeting of members of the association was convened.
There were 13 members out of 15.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates took part in the election: Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
11 members of the association voted for Slyva, two members voted for V. Rastenis.
Slyva will end Stechenko’s term of office, which will last until January 2021.
Alarm in France: Deaths cause concern
French health officials announced on Monday a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide in response to concerns over dozens of people who have recently been poisoned in the West.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-containing products was made after a new safety inspection started earlier this year, ahead of at least three waves of poisoning in the departments of Maine and Loire that began in September.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tons were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Angers region, where a lot of salad juice is grown, complained of eye and throat overstretch, respiratory problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they didn't hasten it," Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the West France newspaper on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe - is considered "probable human carcinogen" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety inspection is to be undertaken.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives to him," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that salad juice growers, farmers in general, will face, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s decision last month to halt the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tons of salad juice consumed annually in Europe.
Next season will be “much fewer salad juices, radishes and pores” after the government halted the use of methame last month, Philippe Retiere, the head of the Nantes breeders’ federation, told AFP.
70 million euros invested in a shopping center with a viewing circle in Tallinn
The new shopping center "T1" will be opened in the capital of Estonia next weekend, in which the local capital real estate development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" has invested € 70 million.
With a total area of 130,000 square meters, or 55,000 square meters rented, the shopping center will feature 150 shopping services or entertainment spaces, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer’s statement.
For comparison, the total area of the Akropolis of Vilnius (considered together with the area for offices) is about 110,000 square meters and rental is 91,000 square meters.
"T1" - the first mall with an overview wheel installed on the roof, according to the developer.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gateways will also be integrated into the territory: nearby tram stations, interurban buses will soon run.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also located nearby, and it is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paolas Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that fundamental changes are taking place in the global supermarket business, and the development of T1 has managed to get in front of them.
“We have created a new generation of shopping centers that provide emotions and experiences unavailable on the Internet.
It is a place of attraction in the very center of the city, a gateway for travelers, an impressive and worthwhile attraction and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family,” Michelozzi said in a statement.
High focus on entertainment
T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic countries.
In total, 12,000 square meters of the property is dedicated to entertainment, or a fifth of the total rental area.
A special emphasis is the viewing wheel installed on the roof.
It will raise guests to a height of 120 meters above sea level - only the TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
After the review round, on the fourth floor, the bathtub park "Super Skypark" will open the largest bathtub center in Europe and the first basketball and volleyball on bathtub field in Estonia, the company says.
In the interactive SkyLAB Exploration and Discovery Center, children are promised to be occupied for at least 5-6 hours.
There will also be a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the conventional cinema, which is shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and chairs moving in the rhythm of the film, the sense of reality here will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected odors, smoke or fog in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonian revenue from tourism by 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group in Lithuania received sales revenue of EUR 1.8 million and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to Pro Kapital Grupp’s financial report.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market received almost 9 million Euros of sales revenue and earned 2.4 million Euros of net profit.
The T1 was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term
During a ceremony led by Parliament President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya vowed to protect the “integrity and unity” of the West African state.
The oldest president in Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was proclaimed the winner of the October 7 election with 71% of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter participation, violence and alleged fraud.
On the eve of Beye’s inauguration, 79 students and three school employees, including the director, were abducted at a presbyterian school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
Most of the 22 million inhabitants of Cameroon are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the Northwest and neighboring Southwest provinces began demanding autonomy in response to dissatisfaction over alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics.
In 2017, after Biya refused to yield, the radicals proclaimed an independent state, the “Republic of Ambassador,” and raised their arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security officials have been killed in separatist attacks and government retaliations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in half-hungry forests.
In October, only 5 percent of voters voted in the Northwest region, while 15 percent voted in the Southwest province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya received two-thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary elections: mistakes caused by inexperience
"There is something missing in places - understand that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed access to their premises, but there were voting cabins not everywhere because we could not buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their substance does not change, and the violations themselves are not malicious in nature.
“There were troubles.
Not all people who participated in the election were experienced - it was also news for them.
So from this inexperience, not all of our actions were in accordance with our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRC that the principles described by us should be followed.
However, these complaints do not give rise to doubts about the outcome,” Anushkauskas said.
According to the Chairman of the CRK, there have been cases where voting bulletins were not sealed, and after learning about this, the bulletins found in the ballot boxes were cancelled.
In some towns there was a lack of space, but according to Anušausko, complaints and violations involve several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it does not really make a fundamental difference to the election results," Anušauskas explained.
It is said that the participation of party members in the election was 55 percent, while the participation of non-partisan voters was 69 percent.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in committees.
The results announced on Sunday also remained unchanged - Ingrid Šimonytė won with 79 percent of votes (16418 votes), while Vygauda Ušack - 21 percent (4441 votes).
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. Šimonytė’s candidacy in the country’s presidential election in May of next year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton said earlier that Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be celebrated this week.
But on his trip to the final rallies ahead of the U.S. midterm congressional elections, Trump told reporters he wasn’t sure if this would be the right opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
“I’m not sure if we’ll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
However, he added, he will meet at the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to “overload” relations with Moscow despite allegations of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The Court of Appeal calls for the cancellation of the decision
Former general director of Santara clinics at the University of Vilnius, Kęstutis Strupas, asks for the cancellation of the decision of the Chief Service Ethics Commission (VTEK) - it recognized that the transactions were not declared in time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupo’s complaint was examined by the Vilnius District Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant asks for the annulment of the decision of VTEK on May 23, the court spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduone told BNS.
Strup believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he claims to have thus understood the exception of the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then removed general director of Santara clinics K. Strupas and the head of the ambulatory rehabilitation department of the Republican University Hospital of Vilnius Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was established that four transactions were declared in violation of the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank with the spouse in 2010, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, the gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted to a natural person in 1996 together with the spouse and not repayed.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmony of public and private interests in public service cannot be promoted for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also the data of the spouse.
The study was conducted by VTEK on the basis of TV information from Info TV.
It was investigated whether Strupes and his wife, the head of the ambulatory rehabilitation department of the Republican University Hospital of Vilnius, S. Strupienė, had properly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, Strup gave his daughter a property worth 125 thousand euros last year.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife did not indicate the above data in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement, along with at least ten other persons, has raised suspicions of corruption in the investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public computers, software purchases in clinics, illegal financial remuneration was demanded from companies, it was disguised as support.
In this way, Strup is suspected of having consulted at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology at Santara clinics.
Mr. Todd himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strup, suspected of corruption, was fired from the position of head of Santara clinics in September.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health and the University of Vilnius, the working relationship with Mr. Strupų was terminated at his own request.
He has been at the hospital since November 10, 2013.
The Santara clinics will continue to be temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a competition is held to elect a new general director, which is planned to be announced later this year.

Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens up thousands of years of wisdom and memory.
Favorite and appreciated works of the author - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testify to L. Gutausk as an artist awarded with diverse talents.

In schools already want to teach differently: promise fewer tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the Vilnius forum "Change in the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania".
The Minister of Education and Science, Jurgita Petrauskienė, said that over the past ten years more than 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of educational content, but no results can be seen.
"According to the results of the international survey of pupil achievements PISA, pupil achievements are below the OECD country average," said Education and Science Minister Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert said that Lithuania is too focused on giving knowledge rather than on practical application.
According to him, Lithuania’s general education programs pay a lot of attention to developing students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, Deputy Minister of Education and Science, when presenting the changes in the general educational content, said that the volume of programmes to be renewed this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific, disciplines stronger linked to each other.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of students will be more individualized, schools will become more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 percent of their unique educational content, the current system of student evaluation will change to a cumulative score, greater weight will be given to the students' competencies acquired in an informal manner.
Less standardized tests.
It is promised that the general educational programs will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The aim of the updating of the educational content is to improve pupils’ achievements in the international PISA survey by at least 10%, reduce the gap between pupils’ achievements by a third, improve students’ modern skills acquired at school, and improve their literacy skills in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget for the updating of educational content from May 2018.
It is planned that the project of renewed general education programmes for the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in some schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
The Ministry received criticism at the beginning of October over the €8 million project carried out by the Education Development Center to renew the framework programmes of primary, basic and secondary education.
For four years, 7.8 million euros are planned for this purpose, and the first 1.3 million euro purchase was announced in early October, in which educational program developers were sought.
After the experts criticized this purchase, it was suspended, and the Minister of Education and Science, J. Petrauskienė, dismissed the Director of the Education Development Center, Giedrijus Vaidelis.
Lithuania: Exercises to respond to extreme floods
Lithuania will begin a ten-day exercise on Monday to improve the response of the authorities to the extreme flooding.
As by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), during the exercise will be checked how the state authorities are prepared to work in the country in the event of a state-level emergency, such as a flood: eliminate its effects, coordinate the search, rescue and urgent evacuation of people from the covered areas, organize their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other measures for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as members of the Emergency Operations Centers of 12 municipalities will participate in the exercise.
On November 5-13, a preparatory phase of the exercises will take place, during which municipalities, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service of the PAHD about the continuing rainfall and the beginning of the flood, will take decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During it, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and the state and municipal authorities will operate the institutional emergency operations centers.
After the government has declared a state emergency due to the consequences of the flood, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the liquidation of the emergency situation, its removal, and the protection and rescue of the population and property.
Deputy Director of PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the most important thing in the exercises is to check the preparedness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities of exchange of information, to check how the population, state and municipal institutions, institutions and companies are prepared to warn and inform about an imminent disaster, and to “improve the state institutions’ emergency management skills”.
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capacity of firefighters and rescuers from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to pump large amounts of water from the covered areas.
For this purpose in 2009 the module "BaltFloodCombat" was established.
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko resigns
Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenko resigned on Tuesday in a speech in the Ukrainian parliament due to the resonance caused by the death of anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the resignation request must be submitted by the prosecutor-general to the president of the country, who must submit it to the Supreme Council to be approved by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor-General J. Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the order of the murder of K. Gandziuk in the Supreme Rada.
Speaking to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed indignation that Gandzuk’s death is being exploited for politicians’ public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unknown assailant splashed acid in her face.
He died in the hospital due to his injuries on November 4.
Demonstrators at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry are demanding an answer to who killed K. Gandziuk.
According to Mr. Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people allegedly involved in the order for the murder of Mr. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the study.
According to the prosecutor general, due to the leakage of information, the suspects obtained them essential knowledge.
Lucenko added that he had personally met Gandzuk and was upset that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
“So that no one has any reason to say that someone is holding on to power, I want to declare that I am giving a statement to resign.
Today I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament," Lucenko's speech in Rada was quoted by the newspaper Obozrevatel.
Lucenko said: “You can’t allow a two-state in a country where the law enforcement system collapses without any evidence, even for revealed crimes.”
Lucenko is considered a close fellow of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed attorney general on 12 May 2016 following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of covering up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Energy Minister Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As informed by the Energy Minister’s adviser Aurelia Vernickaitė, the meeting will discuss the achievement of the renewable energy targets in the transport sector until 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not meet the cumulative trajectories set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The Commission estimates that progress towards the mandatory 10 % target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to a range of difficulties, including relatively high costs for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
Seimas adopted a proposal to supplement corruption investigation issues with the appeal of the Conservatives to KT
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by the "statewoman" Agnė Širinskienė, who leads the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 parliamentarians in favour, 27 opposed and nine abstained.
The draft will then be discussed by the Seimas committees, the mainly appointed Committee on Law and Order led by A. Širinskienė.
After the amendment is adopted, the amendment will be voted.
The Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
Shirinskienė proposed to extend this deadline, stating that "significant information appeared in the public space about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions".
A. Širinskienė describes the project as “possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or in the appeal to the Constitutional Court, or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions, such as the High Commission for Service Ethics.”
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the conservative opposition.
The ruling “peasants” found out that the Conservatives had largely relied on the arguments of lawyers of private pension funds in their appeal.
In influencing the Supreme Commission for Service Ethics (VTEK), the leaders of the “peasants” accuse the former fellow Povila Urbši.
According to them, the former chairman of the State Management and Municipal Committee of the Seimas could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Department of the commission, Mindaugas Siauris.
At the end of September, the Seimas set up a commission to examine the possible unlawful influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the appointment of members of state-run enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to find out what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities and how they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings by May 1 next year.
There will be a presidential election campaign for the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the "citizens".
Its members were also appointed by two social workers, one "orderman" each, a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish Election Action-Union of Christian Families.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the committee’s work.
The new investigation was initiated by the chairman of the ruling Union of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens, Ramūnas Karbauskis.
According to him, the National Security and Defence Committee (NSA) investigation conducted last session on the same topics has shown that the investigation needs to continue.
German intelligence chief misses office
55-year-old Maassen has sparked controversy by saying he was blamed on the "radical left forces" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but was forced to leave the reserve.
Last weekend, it was revealed that during a meeting of European intelligence agencies in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticized Merkel’s “naive” immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen’s recent comments were unacceptable and “personally disappointed.”
Seehofer, himself under pressure from both this dispute and his party’s poor performance in Bavarian local elections, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen.
Shark attacks scare the entire island, a third person has been bitten
The Queensland Emergency Service said in a statement that the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries" during the attack near Sid Harbor on the Peninsula on the coast of Queensland.
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
Peach Island is the largest of the archipelago's sites of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in the region have so far been relatively rare.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack before the last series of attacks occurred in the island in 2010.
The ICC has two new members - Wiscont and Pux
A. Puks was proposed to members of the VRK by the Lithuanian Bar Association.

This party did not have its own representative in the VRK when Donatas Laurinavičius left.
During a secret vote, Pukso’s candidacy was supported by 74 Seimas members, 5 were against and 6 abstained.

Wedding girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
A girl with a white blowing bride dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white lion flying towards the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?
Plus size reality show "Size (r) Evolution" participants will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's pounds.
But that's not all - one of the girlfriends of the project will have tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
“There are still those who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or look of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend himself is an athlete, but for him I like what I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets any standards from me," Aurika will speak before performing in the wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, the dress is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in herself.
I can reassure you that a properly selected model of the dress will solve this "problem"," explained one of the members of the show committee, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls is decided by R. Kalinkin together with the entire commission – Erika Vitulskiene, who opened the plus size fashion house, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of quarrels between the members of the commission - we all represent different spheres and we differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was further complicated by the fact – I can already reveal now – that two newlyweds appeared, who weren’t worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” says Kalinkin.
The newcomers – Eve, who became famous for 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show, and Dovile, a 31 year old mother of exceptional beauty with two children – participated, like other girls, in the selection of “Diddy’s (r) evolution” and entered the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls on the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by the LNK viewers, voting for their favourites on the TV portal.
In Lithuania, the international recognition of the reality show is held for the second week - here plus size girls compete for the name of the first plus size star in the country.
So far, there are only eight of them left – and they all know perfectly that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Dydis (r) evolution" week begins already this Monday evening at 20.30 p.m.
Actor I. Elba named the sexiest man in the world
The American magazine People has named the most sexy man in the world this year.
He was named the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected, he did not hold on to joking about the new title.
I thought, “Can’t be!
Seriously ?”
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought — yes, I look sexy today — laughing and sharing actors.
To be honest, Idriss said that this title was a very pleasant feeling that struck his ego.
The British star says he was often subjected to insulting words and extortion, which made his childhood difficult because, as he says, he was "very tall and reckless."
The young actor did not convince his peers and became the object of harassment due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I just grew up and became the hottest guy in my city district,” Idris smiles.
When his husband fails to be the greatest player on the screen, I. Elba works as a disco player at parties in Spain, especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his free time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a lighthouse of fashion, which he realizes by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor claims that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans to get married to his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba was named 33rd most sexy man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was won by Blake Shelton.
Man Killed During Drinking
On Monday night, a man was killed in a drunkenness in the village of Šalkiški.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 am a report was received that a man beat a neighbor during drunkenness.
Doctors confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was found to be drunk at 2.53.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer require 20 km distance to build waste-burning power plants
A Vilnius cogeneration power plant is being built near the Gariūnų market.
The authorities no longer aim to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from the settlements when building waste-burning power plants.
The head of the environmental protection committee "state" Kęstutis Mažeika on Monday registered in the Seimas an amendment to the Waste Management Act, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeikos, the "peasant" group, which previously supported the provision on the 20 km distance, promises to support the amendment for its refusal.
The amendment of Mr. Mažeika provides that from January 2019 waste incineration plants could be built in accordance with the requirements of environmental protection and public health protection established by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of residential territory, it is clear that such a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to find," said the chairman of the committee.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president’s veto on amendments to tighten the construction of waste-burning power plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste-burning power plants less than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments allowed the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already being built, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provision is not proposed to be adjusted.
The waste and biofuel power plant is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - in cooperation with the Finnish energy group Fortum company Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to address the difficult Northern Ireland issue that is crushing Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed the possibility of reviewing the so-called safeguard mechanism that would allow for an open border between the United Kingdom’s Northern Ireland province and the European Union’s Republic of Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has vowed to consider the proposal, but has rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, May "raised the possibility of reviewing the hedge mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar made clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such review does not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the application of safeguard measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to how to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides have agreed on “protective measures” to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a broader trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be temporarily applied to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph on Monday that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the collateral deal unilaterally in three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this."
"Three-month or limited-term security measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels failed to confirm the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following a news in Britain last weekend that a deal was at hand.
"I would say we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May's spokesman said in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a statement on Monday calling for the right to access reliable information in the internet age.
Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, among the 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy, include Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi and Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
“We call on goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,” the group said in a statement.
They argue that the “global space of information and communication” is a common good that “must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion.”
“People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and distributed, based on commitment to truth, principles of pluralism of attitudes and rational methods of finding facts,” the authors added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news” but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet at the Peace Forum in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories called.
This declaration was drafted over two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of the Paris-based organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) for media freedom and the defense of journalists’ rights.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves increased fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulate that fines for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were approved unanimously.
As Antanas Vinkus, member of the Health Affairs Committee of the Seimas, said, speaking of the new project, it is welcome that the targets set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are aligned with the requirements of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
“In my mind, the proposed bill is better and more specifically distributed to all the operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because entities who have paid fines continue to repeat violations," Vinkus said.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after approval by the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its own proposals.
The amendments aim to raise penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give market surveillance authorities more powers and create a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
As stated by the Ministry of Agriculture, at present, manufacturers are not obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the ministry, market surveillance authorities during the state control of product safety were denied the right to enter the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month deadline for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify the breach, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the imposed fines are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the law – 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It also proposes to give market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of economic operators who manufacture, supply products to the market in the course of state product safety controls.
Increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who has placed dangerous products on the market, or a service provider who has provided dangerous services or provides dangerous services would be subject to fines ranging from EUR 150 to EUR 2500 (now EUR 144 to EUR 1448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, it would be penalized with a fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now EUR 868 to EUR 4 344).
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw hazardous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in fines ranging from EUR 2 500 to EUR 6 500 (now EUR 1 448 to EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2 500 to EUR 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to EUR 11 584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine would be imposed between EUR 6,500 and EUR 25,000 (now EUR 5 792 to EUR 23 169).
According to the Ministry, Poland and Austria impose fines of up to 25,000 euros for breaches of product safety legislation (minimum amount not established), Belgium – from 26 to 600,000 euros, Romania – from 155 to 6,666 euros, Bulgaria – from 125 to 7,500 euros.
10-Year-Old Girl Gives Birth: Raped by Family Member
The events in Colombia have stunned millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl who was raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby came into the world thanks to a cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby are well.
They were monitored by doctors for a while.
It will still take some time before the young mother and the baby will be able to spend home.
“Based on the information I received from police officers, the little girl became pregnant after being sexually abused by a family member – a brother,” the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the case for rape and child abuse.
The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas.
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country’s capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO’s Triangle 2018 exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second battalion of Norwegian military forces after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But they are most skilled in warfare in the Arctic, and these skills are especially useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, soldiers have participated in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Warriors have the skills to survive in this cold wildlife, but in the harsh climate they have to pull a much greater weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers who stayed at the command post say they share their skills to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, very much resemble real warfare, will teach them to be prepared in the event of a serious threat.
The Premier League outsiders won the first victory of the season
The 11th round of the English Premier League ended on Monday night.
A crucial victory after 12 consecutive unbeaten duels in all tournaments was won by the Huddersfield Town team, for which this was the first successful evening of this season.
The duel between Huddersfield Town and London Fulham ended in a home win with a minimum score of 1:0 (1:0).
The defensive football duel caught sight of the audience, as both teams fought for crucial 3 points, and the winner of the match was not clear until the last minute.
Nevertheless, the hosts preserved the superiority and prevented the Fulham team from breaking out the equals.
The only winning goal was scored in the 29th minute by Fosu-Mensahas.
It’s worth noting that this was the first Huddersfield Town goal at home this season.
After the 11th round, Huddersfield Town ranks 18th in the league, Fulham remains last, 20th.
The ex-Country Secretary does not plan to return to politics.
Former deputy mayor of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the organization of Vieningo Kaunas due to his support for Vygaud Ušack in the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies and also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be happy to be able to spend more time with my family,” Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said he will not participate in the upcoming local elections.
Mr. Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ušacko after he lost the primary elections on Sunday to Ingrid Šimonyta.
“To be honest, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about future plans.
Obviously, with Vygaud’s withdrawal from the further election struggle, this phase of my life is over,” Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics because of his support for Ušack, but only regretted that "Lithuania has lost the unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations."
P. Mačiulis briefly served as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to these positions after the successful elections of "Vietnam Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito licėjus" and several other companies.
Workers in the castle: what are they doing here?
Beautiful people, having noticed the workers in the castle of Kaunas, hoped that the work of restoring the surviving tower was finally underway.
The director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, told the portal kauno.diena.lt that the work is taking place here to replace the covering of the protective roofs of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the speaker, the roofs will be cushioned.
“The worn-out bowl coating posed a threat to the people around it – people could fall and get injured – so it had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was damaged," explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All the works are combined with the heritage and other institutions," G. Injured added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the important and practical side - the roofs must protect the values from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Prior to this, elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in the shell during the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum said.
The contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the work will not take longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
“It is expected to be completed by the end of November,” the museum director said.
According to him, the value of the work is approximately 24,000 euros.
This amount, according to the spokesperson, was envisaged in this year’s budget.
The work in the castle is carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas.day.lt has written that according to the research carried out, Kaunas Castle may have appeared earlier.
US and South Korea resume naval exercises
Two weeks of naval exercises with about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang, the defense ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military exercises for years, which Pyongyang calls a "provocation" and "preparation for an invasion."
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program if Washington did not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be “seriously considered,” the North Korean Foreign Ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the sanctions would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean ambassador Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Center for Eastern European Studies will collaborate with two prominent U.S. "brain centers"
According to Lino Kojalos, head of RESC based in Vilnius, which has been operating for thirteen years, the U.S. will implement projects and make Lithuania’s voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two great institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that the niche activities will emerge, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and the development of the countries of the Eastern Partnership that we are analyzing are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that RESC and U.S. institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and organize expert visits.
This should be especially beneficial for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and brings together a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to advise and work for top U.S. political institutions, ranks 10th in the same ranking.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to penetrate the U.S. information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel upwards," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the assistance of partners in the dissemination of the upcoming RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among U.S. decision makers and in the public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects being implemented and does not maintain targeted grants.
RESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international foundations, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were slightly injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire department said.
When buildings collapsed on the streets, debris climbed, clouds of dust rose.
Dozens of firefighters were on the scene near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture posted photos via Twitter showing a bunch of debris and wooden seals, a huge gap in the place where buildings stood, firefighters working on the scene and cars covered with a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who may have found themselves under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
In an amateur video, shown by BFM-TV, there are clouds of dust on the street and passers mouth-covered with sleeves.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident showed that one of the collapsed buildings was five and the other was six-storey.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with blocked windows, with large façade cracks.
Marseille mayor Sabine Bernasconi said one of the buildings was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building was possibly used by people who lived there arbitrarily.
The prefecture urged people to avoid the area and open the roads for rescue services.
The mayor of the Marseille district, Sabine Bernascon, said the building was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.

Mexican restaurant helps deported migrants from the United States
The further, the more Mexicans are deported back, and it is difficult for them to adapt when they return.
“When I was deported, they took everything from me: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything except one thing – my knowledge,” says Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
The restaurant board hopes that bringing together Mexican and U.S. cultures will promote a better understanding of each other.
Afghan Special Forces Officer Kills US Teacher During Training
The 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, Brent Taylor was on a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United Forces Headquarters, but had to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. soldier, whose name has not yet been disclosed, was wounded in a Saturday attack that claimed Taylor's life.
Officials say Taylor was killed by infantry guns.
Utah’s National Guard commander, Major General Jefferson S. Burton, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army’s capabilities.
Utah media cited a NATO report that Taylor was shot by one of the trained special forces and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are scheduled to be dispatched to the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He had previously conducted two missions in Iraq, and this was also his second in Afghanistan.
In January, before he left for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been appointed to a team of advisors and instructors for one of the country’s special forces battalions.
Hundreds of residents of Nort Ogden gathered in the streets of a city of about 17,000 inhabitants to melt their mayor, along with his family, accompanied by police.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
