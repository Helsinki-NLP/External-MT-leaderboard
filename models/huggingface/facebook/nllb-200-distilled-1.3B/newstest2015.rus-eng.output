Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties, as part of his first major overseas visit since winning the election in May.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day visit to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third largest economy.
The agenda is headed by plans to expand nuclear cooperation.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation agreement between the two countries.
FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the last in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release received by the Lenti.ru.
The third meeting will be held to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
The participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to develop a common approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we've done that, and the final version of the regulations are being agreed upon.
At the end of the next session, we should complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation", - said the head of the expert-analytical department of FANO of Russia Elena Aksenova.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutes will take part in the event.
A resolution is expected to be passed.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solyanka Street, 14th House.
Scientists have found a way to detect stars that are related to each other
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformity in star clusters.
The discovery is expected to help researchers search for stars that are related to one another, that is, that originated in the same cluster.
The authors published their findings in the journal Nature, and a brief overview can be found on the university's website.
The reason for the similar chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that preceded the formation of the stars.
Even if a newborn star leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can be used to determine its birthplace and the region of formation of its relatives.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to a difference in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
Over the course of millions of years, this object undergoes its own gravitational pull and transforms into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added marker paints to the original gas flows and found that the rapid turbulent mixing in the clouds produced a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it is possible to search for chemical relatives of stars and to determine the possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karraty police arrested a 20-year-old after he chased a motorcycle at high speed.
The motorcycle was seized after it was driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed limit zone and through bushland to escape police in the Pilbara.
A traffic patrol officer in Carruthers tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, finding it was traveling at 75 miles an hour when it left the service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then veered into the bush, causing officers to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a man matching the driver's description were spotted near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Carrate police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to stop and dangerous driving.
He's due to appear before the Carratha World Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and held for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock on the door" over new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not "knock on the door" in connection with new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking before the students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything must be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will like this time, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
It will not be a knock on the door, some kind of offense, misunderstood, - the minister stressed.
We will, above all, base ourselves on our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners as to their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
The steps taken in the field of sanctions can be very good to judge what the partners are trying to achieve, - the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If they say out loud that "the sanctions will be painful for us too, but we have to go through with it to punish Russia", that's probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of Russia in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO's instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes", Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe are discriminatory EU policies regarding anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and is also being subjected to anti-dumping measures against the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU's third energy package in retrospect", Lavrov said.
How can you use the siren in a garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the cherry tree loses its main attraction after flowering, it is advisable to plant it with other shrubs.
It blends in well with many cultures.
Besides, you can and should plant plants that are decorative in other seasons and that bloom at the same time as the syringe.
Another advantage of sirens is that they provide a lot of creative possibilities.
You can shape it with a stump of varying height, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base, and even a garden bonsai tree with a fancy curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best matches the design of your garden.
Leningrad man convicted of selling fake money in Karelia
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in criminal activities in Olonets and Segeg districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetski district court.
And to finish the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was taken to Segeg.
The investigation has proven guilty in several cases of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
In late June of this year, the criminal case materials with the indictment were sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the four-year prison sentence with a general-regime prison sentence.
The verdict has not been rendered.
Last week, two more counterfeit money dealers were convicted for paying in stores in Petrozavodsk.
Azerbaijanis came to Karelia also from St. Petersburg.
One of them is serving five years, the other four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet been enforced.
In Arkhangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy of the Dervish
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
"Dervish" brought military aid to the USSR from the USA and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally took place at the cornerstone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the veterans' organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first met 23 years ago when the cornerstone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not brought back by the sea", - said the chairman of the veterans' council of the Northern Sea Shipping Boris Karpov.
Then the city's wind orchestra performed, and cadet students gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory flag.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the cornerstone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10 000 tons of rubber, 1 500 tons of uniform shoes, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, the ships carried military equipment and armaments - 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines, and fifteen Hurricane fighters, all in disarray.
The convoy was escorted by 16 ships of the Royal Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan was not detected by the enemy and reached safely the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital operations, 126 transport ships and about 50 warships were lost.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that would protect union organizing as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs", says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers' Rights Amendment Act alongside the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal options for discrimination in union organizations as for other forms of discrimination, by stopping the forces of union opponents.
Amending the Labour Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for joining unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation and fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks on unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, as millions of Americans remember, when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, negotiate and collectively act is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that stated explicitly: "The right to form associations for the purpose of protecting and improving labor and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or field of activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to impair this right shall have no legal force; measures directed at these ends shall be declared unlawful.
When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world treaty, Roosevelt and the framers included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize unions - and for these unions to participate as equal partners in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, and so should we.
Official recognition of labor rights as human rights - and expanded protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis revive the ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the passage of a Louisiana law that supporters say will likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jinald in June and was set to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have authority to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for now, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authorization.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while pursuing their claims", Judge John deGravells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which time the judge will issue a more permanent ruling on this law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authorization.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women are protected from a insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on abortion authority place restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reports.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, this doctor would, for fear of his safety, stop performing the procedure, the group said.
In criticism of the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission are pending.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to ?
At least half of the products in the range of trade networks should be Russian, says Oleg Nilov, a state Duma deputy from the Fair Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper "Izvestia" writes.
The document will be further detailed to avoid any possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to products that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers", - said N. Nilov.
Along with amendments to the article "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activity in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, setting a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in the retail chains is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Taxman", member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
It's a plus for farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means that profits will increase.
They will also have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, who will be forced to buy their products.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
It will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will expand, some will develop faster, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately", the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not get into the local stores due to the high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo is in place, that niche is free and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But we should not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, it's a moment of silence, when the old players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products", - told AiF.ru the first Vice-President of the all-Russian public organization "Russian club of financial directors", Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow the sector to be consolidated with local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper due to subsidies from another country.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will be between companies operating under the same industry rules.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are not able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots in all items.
And in this situation, retailers will have to "pull" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
This has led to fears that substandard products will be sold.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of Russian products", the expert adds.
The negative impact of the introduction of quotas will be felt by the major trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is only logical that foreign suppliers would suffer as well, since demand for their products would decline.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products may be inferior in quality to imported counterparts, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived in February this year by economists due to the relentless devaluation of the ruble.
Now, with the difficult relationship with the West, the question of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to take into account domestic manufacturers when forming orders to suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import substitution, and the system of planning production for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time", says Oleg Nilov, a deputy.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25%.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering the shelves of Russian stores.
Meat production could also be a major driver.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% of the production is still Russian", - says Kasyanova.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will promote import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as a set of measures is needed, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not occur, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, we still need to establish domestic production in the country to meet these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees", the expert says.
Premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who work in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those who live in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35 percent survived five years after the diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in rural and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
FURTHER RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers tracked the women's medical history over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current disease status, and socioeconomic status also affected her survival.
Older women and those with cancer in the later stages at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in rural or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that premature diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"The disease is best treated by gynecologic surgeons, who are mainly in the big cities", she said.
While improving telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The research, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Nieve, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
New FAP to open in Kujer district in September
The construction of the medical facility in Toktaybelyak village was started in April this year and was carried out according to a typical project.
The cost of the work was a little over 10 million rubles.
As reported by the Public Relations and Information Department of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the target investment program.
The total area of the built treatment and prevention facility is almost 230 square meters.
The hospital will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: Toktaybelak and Dementiyevo, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Torybelak, Shinur and Chaškayal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
The woman who killed her four-month-old son while drunk is going to stand trial .
A woman from Chuvashia is about to be tried for the murder of her own child.
The investigation into the death of a 31-year-old woman in Novocheboksar has been completed.
The investigation established that on July 26 of this year, the accused with her four-month-old son came to celebrate the birthday of her godfather's child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the newcomer decided to stay and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up crying at night, the sober woman laid him beside her on the bed to nurse him, but he soon fell asleep.
While sleeping, the woman fell on her son, causing him to suffocate.
The criminal case, the press service of the SCR in Chuvashia, sent to court.
Inflation's out of the holiday.
Will Russians feel the price rise ?
As a result of cross-border sanctions by Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit into the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation will be 6.5-7.5% in 2014, and even less in the next year - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper "Kommersant", this week the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in population incomes.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation would be in force for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation is a one-off shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change", a source in the Ministry of Finance told the paper.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction of sales tax (STA) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation rate will peak at 9% in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat released the first inflation results after the Russian Federation imposed "scrupulous sanctions".
AiF.ru surveyed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department at AForex:
The price increases are already being observed in the main product segments.
Moreover, as social goods became more expensive, the government was forced to launch systematic price stability monitoring measures to prevent risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers already report to regulators on a daily basis so that authorities know exactly who is raising prices, when and why.
The key factors in the rise of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal outflow of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures were kept under control, the cost of a minimum set of food baskets would not have jumped 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on importing foodstuffs has caused a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a logical increase in the final cost.
As we are unable to fully implement the import substitution mechanism at this stage, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry risks of inflationary growth.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of the analytical department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, and in the zero years it was also above the current level, another thing that was compensated for by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8 to 8.5 percent by the end of the year.
Plato Maguta, the asset manager of the Maguta Foundation.
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is being successfully contained so far, but if there is further pressure, especially on the financial sector, it could lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually expressed in the purchase of cash currency to secure their savings.
It is possible to assume that the government, the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the price increases traditionally start after the summer lull and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to hold, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Homeowners are down in the garden centers
This drop, driven by the exceptional decline in homeownership under 35, could see gardening centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach "basic gardening age", according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend an average of 55 percent of what homeowners spend on gardening.
It cites the increasing number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving out front yards for parking and the reduction in garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which has an estimated annual sales of £5 billion.
Greater London, where homeownership fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, has the lowest expenditure rate in the UK for household gardeners.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting a home and not having space for a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at the RHS, said: "Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move".
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail gardening goods as a result of the increase in homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
Bulgaria's Agriculture Ministry has carried out a massive clean-up of the Agriculture Fund
Three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agriculture Foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture only announced the removal of executive director Atanas Dobroev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasilev.
It turns out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the foundation were quietly replaced on Friday.
The deputy executive director of the SAPSD, Tatyana Angelova, who was responsible for state aid and the program until then, was released, the Bulgarian State Agency for Economic Affairs reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I was not present at the board meeting because we are not members of the board by law, but I was later told that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't being reported on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation right now.
I hope to learn more on Monday", she told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of "Investment Credit" at the central fund in "Agriculture" in Sofia.
The deputy executive director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Before that, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU-paid fields.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the "Agriculture" foundation in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the foundation, Atija Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey is recalling an American diplomat over a report of espionage .
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's top American diplomat to explain a report of American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US affairs representative and Turkish officials discussed the announcement on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany's main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target provoked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The biggest Chinese companies are united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
But catching up with the Chinese Internet miracle, which has overtaken even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com, will be a challenge.
The Union of Large
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% each by the internet companies, according to a report by Wanda Group.
The company is planning to register in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to its chain of 40 high-end hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year , the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $ 8 billion) in building a movie studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate $960 million in revenue.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by its rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, the merger will allow Wanda to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, said Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce", said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"There is no real O2O platform in China right now, and in this situation, everyone has a roughly equal chance", he said.
China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: that's more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And by 2015, that number is projected to grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was until recently China's richest man, but according to Bloomberg's billionaires index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Lee is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is fourth.
"It's a very interesting battle to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the richest", said Cao Lei, director of the China e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Bloomberg reported.
But he believes the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome can't be built in a day".
Alibaba's recent quarterly financial performance report shows that it is not easy to compete with not only new companies but also the established leaders of global e-commerce.
Alibaba is often described as something in between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost twice as high as the similar sum of its competitors - it has almost tripled year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has huge money-generating potential, thanks in large part to its mobile apps", commented an analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service on Bloomberg's report.
According to an updated prospectus of Alibaba on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
While 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is going to announce the price of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is likely to take place on September 16.
The company's road show preceding this event will kick off on September 3rd.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and raise about $20 billion.
The previous record for the largest amount of funds raised on U.S. exchanges was held by Visa, which made a $17.9 billion initial public offering in 2008.
At least half of the food products in the retail chains should be Russian, state Duma deputies believe.
They've drafted a bill on the subject.
The amendments are to be made to article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activity in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of the products produced domestically in stores must be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the bill also makes changes to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for all food products originating in Russia, the newspaper "Izvestia" reports.
On August 27, a bill was introduced in the lower house of parliament to amend the Federal Law "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive in Russia farmers' markets, where small producers can sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials from the municipality of Calvia to the Mallorca state prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious centre of rampant drunkenness Magalufe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody following corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish National Guard guards on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say the government's protectionism is seriously affecting their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving", one businessman told the court.
We can't compromise our very existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer targeting 24 men while running around bars.
The island's authorities have since tried to curb drunken hooliganism among Magaluf holidaymakers by minimizing the number of notorious bar-drinking scandals.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the minette incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar run together were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the scene of numerous drunken accidents involving the crazy fun known as "balconying", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
A FREDDY spring has brought a surprise to the south of South Australia, with torrential rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The latest rain was preceded by a pair of short downpours with gusty winds, including thunderstorms that began shortly before 8 p.m. and rained nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave way to an early spring last week, temperatures plummeted again on Monday to a record high of just 15.8C in the city.
The poor conditions are thought to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into a wind shift zone - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 30 miles per hour on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
Highs in Adelaide are forecast at 16C on Tuesday with a chance of one or two showers.
Construction facility estimates in Russia to be calculated in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service is taking special control of pricing, regulating the construction industry, and connecting to the grid.
The FAS has established an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Housing, Communities and Construction and Natural Resources Control Department of the Federal Housing Administration Vadim Solovyov stated that "today's estimate of the construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, the FAS believes.
And they propose that the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the roadmap and are now under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional construction estimates with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry", explained Vadim Solovyov.
Because the estimate now includes every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
The Ministry and the FAS agree.
"The first developments on the transition to calculating the cost of the construction elements are already there: methods have been developed for calculating the prices of the construction solutions, drawing up estimates on these indicators, - said "RGB" the head of the Department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of construction Elena Zhukova.
The road construction sector has been selected as a pilot project.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told RGB, the estimate standards are long outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations for the structural elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, since buildings are often built using completely different technologies", he says.
It's no secret that the construction industry is largely a government enterprise.
According to the chairman of the board of the National Enterprise "Expert Community of State Procurement Professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payment-able customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director of engineering at Rosatom's Industrial Capital Construction Center, noted that the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter the market.
He believes that a transparent market can only be created if access to contracts is as secure as possible from anyone's controlling influence.
The expert council proposed to form a system of state contracts in such a way that the same contractor does not have the right to receive more than one contract for a sum of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts for a sum of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of employees and budgetary costs for its maintenance.
The contracting authorities are required to provide the necessary information to the contractor to assess the quality of the work and its safety.
Often, such a breakdown will require determining who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public contract for an incomplete work volume and a small contract amount.
Alexander Yevstachenkov, deputy head of the expert-consultation center of the Institute of Purchases, believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave an example: "A participant must indicate "specific indicators" when filling out an application without indicating the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "analogous type", "not lower", "lower", "higher", "may", "may have", "may be", "before", "not earlier", "not higher", "is not allowed" and so on.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of the application submitted by the contractors.
Another problem of the 44-FZ, according to Yevstachenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of submitting the application.
The expert believes that when considering the application of a participant, only the qualification of the contractor can be evaluated, but not the quality of the work, which has not yet been started.
The quality of the work can only be assessed by accepting it.
The expert council also proposed moving marginal revenue from the top to the bottom echelon to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The chairman of the expert council, the state secretary, the deputy head of the FAS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, believes that this should not be done, because the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Or else it will be like Arkady Raikin's famous "Atelier" reprise: "Do you have a complaint about buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in Gaza remained closed as the territory rebuilt from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, was cleaning up the debris from the walls and the children's sheds before the children arrived.
"We are a little scared, but we are looking forward to the future", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many of the kids in our neighborhood really need to get back to a life of moderation.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that going back to school was "a little weird".
"It was a difficult time, and we never left our homes", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before a ceasefire agreement ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed indoors or fled their homes to safer areas farther from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old Palestinian boy was killed by a shrapnel from a landmine, are unsure whether they should return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families still haven't returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said: "We will do everything we can to educate you and keep you safe".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately ended the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in Gaza have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like children from all over the world and Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to a popular benchmark, real estate prices have shown the biggest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home price index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase in June, July and August of 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 month growth rate by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne were leading the two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney's house prices have risen 16.1 percent in the past year, while Melbourne's have risen 11.7 percent.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which had gone through government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent a year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties listed for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high level of auction sales speed, the overall high sales speed and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that house prices will still rise over the next three months", he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and mining workers Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution Street 57/1 (formerly Big Kazan) 18 apartments.
The 18th-century house has remained virtually unchanged since its construction, except for its old age.
Strangers come here as if on a field trip, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which commemorate the memory of the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction is not known, but historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But either way, it turns out the building is at least 300 years old.
The old yard, the door always open, the squeaky stairs.
The doors are close together, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the light from the stucco.
It seems like everything is on the up and up.
The locals say, "You don't think it is".
It is very difficult to live in a 18th-century wooden house, says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The site is in state care, but no money has been allocated for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
It was last renovated 40 years ago.
The walls are still a little rough, but the foundation is all rotted.
Many residents still use the toilet outside, but bathe once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content in such conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls the curtain back.
Now you can see what you've only heard before: a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are always crumbling, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
Man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still in good shape, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Besides, we have two rooms, three of us and our son.
Other families have much worse conditions, with ceilings on the second floor only a little over a meter and a half high.
To contrast, Tatyana offers to visit her neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Staroština.
A nice, hospitable woman on the doorstep offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14 square feet for four people, and we live there with my husband, my daughter, and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another living space, - Lyudmila looks around the room: antresols, two sofas with a "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
It's very small and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But the ceiling is leaking regularly. The plumbing system is no good.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment in a casual and surprising way, like an Italian whose house is on Roman ruins.
So it's a combination of the very old and the very recent, the everyday and the legendary:
The water main was cut about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet out of the old closet.
We live in the same apartment where Demidov and his family lived, the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, so why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says privatization is irrelevant.
We'll only get one room anyway, we can't ask for more.
Four months ago, they promised to move us, but they never did.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
This apartment was the home of a dynasty: my grandparents, my mother and father, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened in that time.
For example, large rats were running around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, that's why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demidov!
Probably why no one's been killed by a collapsed ceiling or a pile of debris.
But the building is still dying slowly before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have fallen down repeatedly, we poured cement, but it's all useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say there is a secret passageway under our room to the White River that was built by the Old Believers to protect us from danger.
They were being chased.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begging to let him start excavating in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give him a place to live in exchange for his one-room apartment on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us going alone?
There's a small chance they'll make it bigger.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Old Ones, however, won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream is to have them moved in and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter have their own room.
So two families were given a two-bedroom apartment instead of the not-so-magnificent ruins that two generations now live in.
A cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two small rooms, called apartments, with a total area of 23 square meters.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
The plaster falls off in pieces, as do the window frames, the walls in the kitchen and the rooms with the through holes.
The tap water is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can see that the most fortunate of all were the couple Lavrentyev from apartment No. 4.
They're in the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
It's a 75-square-foot facility, three people.
We live in the rooms where Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, according to legend, - says family head Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
The bad news is, everything around you is cracking, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbors must have told you already!
The most painful part was the floors: the wooden planks were rotting, the ground was literally moving from under our feet.
I've put up the props, the wedges, there's nothing in the room, and in the other room we're walking, swinging, everything's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you more about the house of the merchant Yevdokim Demidov than any tour guide.
He treats the goldsmith like one of his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagi and Uzyan plants built houses, cast cannons and bells, held the Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
The wooden carriage houses, stables, and guard booths were later demolished.
In 1968, they tried to clean up our house, but something stopped them.
The story repeated in 2014: they were again given new housing.
We were working as a team, getting all the paperwork together, going through the proper procedures, and suddenly we found out that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
The tenant was turned away.
They would send it from one table to another, and then, as a joke, hand out a paper without a signature or seal: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the resettlement of the residents".
I even feel like our house is long gone from the city map, because it was 57 first, then 57A, now 57/1.
It's like it was torn down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" has appealed to the head of the information and analytical work sector of the Ufa land resources department Vladimir Barabash.
The house at 57/1 October Revolution Street is included in the program of old housing.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I do know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, is successfully being implemented.
The residents are to be moved to new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy, the architectural biennial is taking place, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will look exactly as they did three centuries ago.
Demidov's house will probably be a museum open to all.
In addition, the government has decided to make the street pedestrian-only on weekends.
Unfortunately, we can't do it on weekdays, because the city's too busy.
Vladimir Barabash promises to move people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: Their new apartments will be the same size as their current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye , forest fire started due to thunderstorm
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Hunting Forestry in the Pojarsky district of the Primorsky Krai.
The fire is being extinguished by a new group of forces and equipment.
According to the information of the leadership of the State Security Service of the Primorsky Air Base, the conditions created at the fire site require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the air base:
The fire, which started in a difficult-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft on a 3-hectare area.
The wood burns on the old burner.
The area is heavily overgrown and the slope is more than 45 degrees, and there are no suitable landing sites for firefighters.
We need an Mi-8.
The delivery of forces by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft at the airbase is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, four firefighters were quickly disembarked at the site.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and firefighting equipment.
In the area of the lunch in the area of the village of Hunting helicopter additional 3 firefighters.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the fire area is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of Primorsky Krai.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you".
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of shows on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to navigate some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, would go to pubs with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never spoke to him like that.
He was this unmoved guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to get a glimpse of what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoky, deep labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and piles of soot.
My dad got in the bathtub and just lay there, and you could hear him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized he'd been doing this for years and years to make a living for us, and I appreciated him more.
Yet, Henry came out of his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you".
It wasn't until my mom got sick at the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billie, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
Don French.
Why can't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
He's still good friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why can't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really better and I started having symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
I then began to exercise seriously, and I also had to go on a strict diet to relieve my symptoms.
It's very heavy.
And it is boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career change is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been completely immersed in the theater.
It was followed by "The Comedy of Errors", and then "The Gherkins" by August Wilson.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies that were an integral part of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black parody/comedian on television".
He was studying at work.
I had to grow up not only in the public eye, but I had to learn to be an effective joke machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and that was very hard.
Lenny in The New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to the Menestrels' Black and White Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces", Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with crowds.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Playing characters who both mocked and glorified black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it feels a little like you're dragging your time or slowly pulling away".
Next up was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't say I was taught that at school, and I thought that was largely the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage down front.
So I was really scared of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, they said, "You have to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he got hooked.
I got a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been straightened.
"This is what it is, this is serious business, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Comedy of Errors".
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.'"
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in the play, stay in the play".
Henry in The Fences at the Dutchess Theatre
It was hard to learn the lyrics to "The Guns".
Panic is pretty good, it builds muscle.
It was well received, too, so it was like a sign from above that said, 'This is what you should do.'"
He says it, of course, in a THUNNING voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the comedy mentality, where he's always interrupted by his flashes of humor, and he's always parodying.
I just decided not to do stand-up because this whole instant reward thing from a room full of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying, you can get stuck.
I sometimes work at Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don't get the same pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he's ever gonna do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a lot of fun.
You're always telling a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has started biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from government payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to reduce corruption in government structures after he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was missing from payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanjama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are to report to identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure their data is collected through biometric registration procedures, a government statement said.
Anyone who doesn't do so without good reason will be stricken from the bill, it says.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalisation of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government - thus ending the 'invisible workers' problem", said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the cabinet of ministers for planning and structuring government.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government", local news agencies report.
Police did not immediately comment on the news.
Among those arrested were 14 senior officers, the Hurriyet Daily News reported.
Some of them participated in a corruption investigation last December that aimed to investigate government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of organizing a criminal group and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power, by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children in Ukraine are back in school
Schools in most parts of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after summer vacation.
The day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for peaceful skies.
The whole of Ukraine, the great united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for peaceful skies.
Aleksander Pastukov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will be given knowledge that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the person of Rhona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the impressive leader it needs.
She's followed by a slew of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circles of the Tory Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership roles.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position at Pearson's parent company was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say she earns close to £1 million.
Her political rating is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he was trying to bring in private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poison cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inside as the top level of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also out as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It's an almost unattainable duopoly that needs a complete radical overhaul.
But what new chairman would risk coming along and trampling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he lost his job in the process?
It's a tough call.
If it were not so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC downsized after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of licensing pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest £145.50 a year, the British buy a stake in what is arguably the world's greatest media company.
The BBC has a good story: it claims that its work reaches 96 percent of households and costs each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared with 31 percent 10 years ago.
The patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed: I now get the headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed shows on iPlayer.
But it's still a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs a big chairman, I hope he finds one.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by an outsider.
A tweet from confirmed account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an offensive image of the Democratic district attorney, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, where the recording was de-voiced.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet and I've deleted it", a later post reads.
Perry's aides didn't immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the footage was uploaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually posting the tape.
An earlier tweet featured a disgraceful caricature of Travis County Prosecutor Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her agency when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption reads, "I don't always drive drunk, three times the legal alcohol level, but when I do, I sue Governor Perry for telling me about it".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg didn't have a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was run by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law that is being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history would be unconstitutionally vague.
Perry stopped funding of $7.5 million from the state's Public Oversight Division, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto has prompted an official complaint from a left-leaning public-control group.
The tape of Perry's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes becomes famous.
Finishing fifth at the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by a lake and the words, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the housing market is back to "normal"
One of London's most prominent property developers warned that the real estate market in southeast England was "returning" to normal activity.
Houses in the capital have been subject to a surge in demand and soaring prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Peagley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013", adding that this has provided a "stable working environment".
London's real estate market thrived during the recession as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city have jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly outpacing the 6.7 percent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes at Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage reform, which introduced tighter lending conditions, would also cause market growth in both property sales and prices to decline in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its 2015 London property price growth forecast to 3 percent on the basis that property price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes meanwhile fell by a quarter from a year earlier in London's most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for housing in the capital proved very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales to over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right product with the right design and the best location remained the same, and, reflecting this, the sales of the term have remained".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual profit before tax rose 40 per cent to £380m, revenue 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
Speaking Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Peagley said Berkeley's projected earnings for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a full year profit before tax of £450 million is expected.
Berkeley's stock price held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Jennifer Lawrence 's naked photos were posted online by a hacker .
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
The nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of 100 other rising stars.
A spokesperson for the star of The Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and denounced the hacker for "grossly invading his personal space".
We've got a report in to law enforcement, and they're going after anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained due to a flaw in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are authentic, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. Everybody" star Winstead also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"For those of you looking at the photos I took with my husband a few years ago alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourselves", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon series iCarly and Victoria's Secret has denied that she is in the photos, tweeting: "These so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, folks.
Let me stop this in its infancy.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos allegedly featuring her were real.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which has been praised by critics.
They dissolved, best put, they gradually fell apart like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only occasionally did a woman tell him that he was too serious, difficult to communicate with, tense, withdrawn, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw a little bit of irritability in you.
He was as thorny as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorn was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, a release from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a frail beauty with a twisted hair and a throbbing heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royne.
She came south with an older companion whom Kevern considered her aunt, with the latter inheriting a house in a damp but paradise-like valley with the joyous name "Paradise Valley".
No one's lived in the house for years.
Pipes were running, spiders were sitting in the bathtub, slime was tracking all the windows, convinced that the house belonged to them, and weeds were growing in the garden, like giant cabbage patches.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both terrifying and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's Note: Howard Jacobson, whose novel J was longlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevin and Eileen sat, holding hands, in broken armchairs among the tall grass, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring day; they both distractedly plugged into the cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer his father loved to listen to as he lowered the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, these types of songs were no longer played on consoles.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually banned -- they just weren't playing anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste did what orders and regulations could never do, and just as people chose books that were rich memoir, poor childhood memoir, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads from all kinds of music.
Having taken up the day, Kevern set about playing an imaginary piano and singing Eileen's big feet in a roughly comic voice.
Eileen didn't know.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he told her, carelessly pressing two fingers to his lips.
That's what his dad always did to stop the letter "J" before it came out of his mouth.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with a "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it's gonna cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He just knew he was expected to, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
They didn't play jazz, either, although it wasn't outright banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one if left in life.
When a tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was getting on people's nerves.
And jazz was wit expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that each segment of society agreed with gratitude -- gratitude for those who were spared -- to the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited to entertainment and sports - they sang and ran.
The people from India, who seem to be naturally gifted in all things electronics, have taken steps to ensure that no family is left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was involved in sanitary work; what remained of the Greek diaspora was making plates.
The people from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents didn't leave the country in a hurry when what happened, if it really happened, for fear of being accused of starting the fire, for fear, in fact, of being consumed by the flames, opened restaurants with a bar and a steakhouse, and they hung out and laughed.
To each his own.
Since Eileen had only heard ballads before, it was difficult for her to understand how the insulting words that Kevin had just sung to her could even be put to music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", said Kevin.
Unless, of course, it's for people with big legs.
My dad never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a word could get through the soundproofing of the giant, cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand it anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put his fingers to his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, closing Kevin's view.
There was nothing in the whole world but a lock of her brilliant black hair.
Nothing he'd want to look at.
"Well, if you say so", she said, holding her own.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too soon.
"I like you because you have thick ankles", he tried to say instead.
I have this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
His attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that would soften the cruelty lurking in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevin.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the armchair, flipping the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
The wine was from the beetroot, so the intoxication could not be an excuse.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you're stupid", she said...
Even though I don't like you.
He felt sorry for her both for the excessive rudeness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she fought back.
Did she think he would hit her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he was sure that she was similar in many ways to her hometown.
The same huge ocean of ice fell on them both.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after what happened, if anything, than their smuggling and vandalism ancestors, roamed furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman who dared to refuse or tease them.
What's wrong with you?
They'd have given her a dumb fist if she wasn't careful!
Kissing first - now the most common expression of erotic arousal between a man and a woman - was the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console offered, kissing first and then hitting.
Unnecessary detail, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons's body showed he needed to go.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She felt the weight of his grief, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the top window she watched him go, her companion a man who had taken on himself a burden.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a little bit of pity for him and for men in general, even though some of them were raising their hands against her.
A man who had turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all fighting ability gone from him - why did she seem to know it so well if she could not remember a single instance, until today, when she had seen it?
Again, Eileen Solomons alone looked at her feet.
Twenty years or so before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher at Ophnau, an unofficial watchdog of public sentiment, prepared a brief report on maintaining low and moderate levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not cease altogether, given the resources and efforts that were being put into eradicating it.
"Much has been done", she wrote, "and much is being done to soften the innate aggressiveness of men who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow patches of land where, despite the spires of churches hovering over the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in all history.
Some traits, however, are not easily eradicated.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it seems to generate.
While people shed tears over sentimental ballads, swallow stories of overcome obstacles, and declare their fervent belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, not only does the old rudeness hold its own in rural communities and urban settlements, but there are also reports of new and malicious bullying in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
"You have a nasty habit of writing too much", said her supervisor after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum has her head down.
I must also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that", Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
It's quiet again.
"I ask", Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of the community without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, which are completely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you showed me.
It is obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rough" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to mourn over what happened, if it happened at all, as if it happened, if it happened at all, yesterday, is to deprive a country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-like pink LED letters repeating the advice that the Ophnau has been giving the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean", Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she made sure her scientific supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
What worries me is that if we're not prepared, we'll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened, if it ever happened.
Only this time, we won't take our anger and distrust out on anyone else.
Luther Rabinovich connected his fingertips to the pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far", he said, "in calling 'mistakes' actions that our grandparents made or didn't make.
You're going too far when you say they took their anger and distrust out on others.
A person in your position shouldn't need a reminder that in understanding the past, that is, in defending the present, we're not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no us and there was no others.
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with ourselves", Esme dared insert, "no part of society can well justify itself.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what's done is done.
That was then.
There's nothing more to say. We're in agreement.
And just as you don't blame anyone, you don't make excuses if it's appropriate or if it can be fixed.
But what's the use of the past if not to learn?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one word to that -
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovich has collapsed.
"I will consider your report", he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove off the sidewalk in what passersby described as "an angry rage".
Coincidences do happen.
Lesotho army says no coup was planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
The army in Lesotho denied that a coup was being planned to overthrow the government, saying it was against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had received death threats.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoi said there was no coup, but that the army was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos", he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, all indications are that the Lesotho armed forces are currently acting in the main characteristics of a coup", he said.
Lesotho's army said soldiers returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metzing is running the government in Tabana's absence.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been tense since June when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in his united government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Milan, according to Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he only played three times for the London club.
Recall that earlier, Milan had hired the striker Fernando Torres from Liverpool.
Production in the euro area at lowest level in 13 months
Eurozone manufacturing growth slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a popular study.
The latest Markit business activity index (PMI) for the euro area manufacturing sector fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone's recovery stall and the threat of deflation with inflation at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give further signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the dampening effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more apparent", said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany's manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
France continues to be a real concern, as is Italy's decline from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has subsided in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are also not giving confidence", said Mr Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts who expect additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the euro area manufacturing sector's business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing".
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - hard, and is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it "increasingly looks like" the ECB will eventually have to implement some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited".
Mariupol residents will put up a chain of fire against the militiamen
Until last week, everything was calm in Mariupol - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the residents are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the "militia".
According to the political experts, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which before that was not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolans decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but it has little power against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they decided to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building checkpoints and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people gathered at the eastern border of the city, and stood in a live chain, singing the Ukrainian national anthem.
They're going to do the same thing in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
The city is gradually closing stores, banks and ATMs.
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horrific school seizure, how the children who were trapped there still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school shooting.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of a Beslan school that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors of the disaster were warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When the terrorists, the Islamic fanatics, kidnapped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like the ultimate evil.
The tragedy united East and West in a disgust that miraculously turned into action and hope for the future amidst the grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who stood up to adversity, even though the memories of the terrorist inferno will live with them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the photo trying to get back into the bombed-out gym
She is pictured in a photograph by the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, trying to climb back into a bombed-out sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
In her confusion, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There was a fear that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't", Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and I crawled back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
I got a few shards in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, helping people as she helped the doctors.
"The tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it", she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoyeva, was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little, and we used to dream about going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about family later.
She says the grip stays with her, although the memories get a little darker every year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our plight, and we are so grateful for the help we've received from people in the UK and all over.
When I see a picture online of me climbing into a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven years old, and he said, "My mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand".
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing that she might die, he ran and saw a baby crying on the road, grabbed her by the hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son from outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara escaped and was hospitalized with leg injuries, thinking her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now defunct News of the World newspaper) where he was awarded as a Children's Defender by Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it", he said yesterday.
I can tell you that I have a faint memory of him.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play video games with a gun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never made it out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed at the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and the ride in the open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars are causing the sorrow he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors", said Damir, who volunteered at a women's monastery last week.
I want to help so bad.
I want to be a police officer someday and hope to get into the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence immediately after the seizure, there were just no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can be supportive.
She was grateful to "Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir was shooting them with his water gun, and they were running away and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't gotten any better in 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine right now, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like us.
I think for a lot of people, war is the news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very gentle and calm boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to mention it, but they're very close with six of his classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiro is now 17, he is taller than I am, handsome, smart, and healthy.
I can't believe for hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand up, I looked around and I saw hell all around me, body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember screaming at him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
I'm not going to lie to you.
A boy whose shocking photo after his capture became a defining moment in the Beslan tragedy
Death: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 seizure, and right Georgy today
His bloody face was a mark of fear as he fled death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a chief physician, took him to school on his first day before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, leaving my little boy alone for three days of nightmares", she recalled.
Not just one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
My George was the only one who survived.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a day that goes by that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in a sculpture (right)
I remember George was so eager to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a statue of a weeping George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photo is helping people all over the world feel our pain.
He says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating these tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares about being abducted, but now I'm better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Incredibly, Georgy Farniev was at the terrorist's feet when he was captured, but he managed to survive.
At the time of his capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the terrorist-killer's feet.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday", says Georgy, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer in the FSB but was unable because of the damage that was done to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids deal with bad things easily, which I have to say is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I wish I could forget.
In 2005, the following year, was the first and last time I walked into that gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in that famous photo.
Georgy Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital after his capture on his laptop
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm in good health.
I need to be careful with my knee, which was injured, but I'm walking normally now.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I had hoped.
I sent my papers, including medical records, and they said it was impossible.
My other passion was animals, so I went to veterinary school.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something kids need to know, and it's definitely not something they need to experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.
She's in my heart, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate her.
I know Georgie won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I'm so thankful to God that he's back with me.
He's staying with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't play because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's 50% over that nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the occupation, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families where new babies are born, but I also know widows who never get married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I'll never forget the heart leaping out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country right now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If we could just grab all the rebels and dump them as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby that was moved to safety by a special forces soldier.
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
She's ten now, and she has no memory of the heinous crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alyona was carried out of a seized school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, then three years old, survived, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in the massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the seizure and has blossomed into a bright, cheerful girl, say neighbors.
"They are a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great dad and he wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary comes.
It's easy to see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to playing in the German club's shirt again.
He said the transfer was a joyful career move.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again", Kagawa said.
I feel very good.
I'm full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to getting back on the pitch in Borussia.
Kagawa moved to Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to establish himself in the English club, having played only 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 effective transfers.
A man has been charged with running over a girl at the Pelican Crossing in Fife.
A 78-year-old man is to stand trial on charges of running over a three-year-old girl at the Pelican Crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a crossing in Pittenweed in East Newport.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit a girl, injuring her.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, has pleaded not guilty in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the King's Counsel, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande are not going to get together in Vladivostok.
The Duty Free shop at Vladivostok airport has a sign banning a number of world political leaders from shopping there.
Don't give them perfume, vodka or cognac.
The store's administration has decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other well-known comrades will not be able to buy vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama was previously banned from the MSU Dietary Dining Room, an even less accessible facility, according to the food service website.
Whether the American president ever had a dream of eating at a diet diner in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban clearly seem to be awfully witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gives advice to agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should learn new technologies to produce the cheeses that customers want.
The advice was given during a visit to the "Agrocomplex" firm's "Yugpticeprom" enterprise.
The head of government also advised restaurant owners to switch to Russian meat, which is of good quality.
An annual food import embargo was imposed in Russia on August 7.
Russia's head coach Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All sports" Maslakov.
Third place is a testament to our high command level.
It's nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We have to remember that we didn't prepare for this competition.
The season is over, and we're not obligating our leaders to play in the DecaNation game.
We've been second in the tournament in recent years, but this season we've updated our squad.
The French, on the other hand, put together a fighting team that included 13 European champions.
They made no secret of their intention to win this year, as they have publicly stated many times.
But even this host team couldn't match the Americans.
So I think the Russians performed well in such a representative company.
But the results in some events were an order of magnitude lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season's over.
Of course, the result is no longer as important to athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The point was the location.
And the results, I agree, were absurd, when the men were so caught up in the 1,500m tactical trickery of running that they performed below the average... of the women's races.
4 tips for better underwater photography and video
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soapbox, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family reunion using a couple of cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also, set your camera to the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, figure out how deep your equipment can go.
Some of the chambers are only designed to be five feet long, others are 50 or 60 feet long.
Check out our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both conventional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because a lot of them won't work.
The washers are the LCDs that help you compose the images, whereas action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the framing is a random process.
So, take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive.
If possible, stay near the surface when you shoot in a pool, river or ocean.
It also allows you to convey more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the target.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.
Especially important if you're shooting with an action camera: This equipment often comes with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get close to the subjects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling, Biyal Makhov, may move to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan national team in free wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Biyal Makhov is in the "classic" team, - says Sajid Sajidov.
In general, in junior years, Bilyal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third runner-up in the Greco-Roman competition and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There's been talk for a long time that the next stage of his career will be in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I'll say more: Makhov can play at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the match.
But the decision is always up to the coaching staff led by Gogie Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose strength of character could shake everything, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to relieving patients of both the suffering of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, patients are primarily concerned with something else entirely - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I was", he wrote in May last year.
I had a hard time finding the strength.
As he struggles with flu-like symptoms, he finds himself irritated and reprimanding his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen sooner rather than later", he said.
When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But it's different with mesothelioma.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material once called a "miracle" but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a recommendation for an industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was in use, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But that kind of calm is wrong.
It turns out that the UK is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease as from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're feeling its deadly effects now is that while asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually outlawed in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
And the onset of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, a contaminant in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we go to school, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not care about class, income, occupation or age.
The bastions of the elite, from London's trendy department stores to private schools, turned out not to be the answer.
The parliament building is asbestos-infested.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe wrench.
Actually, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with the asbestos.
Then he got it.
"It seems there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years as an intern", he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors, and truckers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers have the same disease?
It was a question he could unfortunately only partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been interning at Guy's Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one who has survived".
How many of us have this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die within eight months of being diagnosed.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us have the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, the most likely estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to end, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't realize they're going to die like this.

A quick look at courtroom reports, where victims often seek compensation, shows just how widespread the mesothelioma outbreak is.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was a flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before this", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I had barely heard of asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not a single substance but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word asbestos, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious health hazard" that can lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocidol) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong, albeit indirect, evidence to suggest that it is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma cases [in Britain]".
A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the company's flagship store on Oxford Street, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pitto's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Much of this exposure, he says, is due to "normal use and weather effects" on our buildings.
No one seems to know for sure that he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting that looked at the Palace of Westminster shows how people, even at the very center of government, could be unwittingly exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be triggered by something as harmless as "strong air currents".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
While the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it now acknowledged that £1 billion worth of work needed to rebuild the Parliament by improving the electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs may sit in the QE2 Conference Centre nearby instead of the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to various regulations".
There's no way to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of the people who never identified their exposure to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related lawsuits", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is a day in early December of 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45 and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly I started to have a fever.
It started really fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He ended up not being able to go to work for a month.
The doctors, who were puzzled, took chest X-rays and placed pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet, his condition went undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms would return, often after he exercised and had difficulty breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in the ER with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and had been exposed to asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT and X-ray results to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between his chest wall and his lung wall.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on", he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's. "I was told it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Suddenly, Abbott was immersed in a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"As it turns out, asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos insulation was quite common", he says.
People who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
So mesothelioma now affects younger people in unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients were unlikely to be harmed.
But many workers who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson did), or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did), were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were theoretically a place where they saved the lives of patients, but a place that was a life-threatening place for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren were installing their Bunsen torches on asbestos stands.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire resistance properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many of you may have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in the classroom.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, students mounted their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Web sites have been created to raise awareness of the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or shed roofs tend to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's in so many of our buildings", says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when you tear down the barn.
The impact of a diagnosis when you know that the disease is incurable is enormous.
"It takes a long time to realize that", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was going from doctor to patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being baffled by the amount of information he had to take in.
"It was hard to understand", he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
That's it".
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it's the mechanics of how we sustain life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by inhaling asbestos needle fibers", says Professor Tom Treger, a cardiac surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated several others who may have been exposed during their hospital internship.
When asbestos needles enter lung tissue, Treger says, "they are pushed out of the lungs by the breath and into the periphery of the lining.
It's essentially an invasive process from the start.
The usual treatments for other cancers are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree with that.
"You can't cut out the pleura", he says.
It's impossible to go around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very well tolerated by chemotherapy", which "works" but does not cure it.
"From time to time, patients live longer", says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, single-handedly became a support and counseling center for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central", he said cheerfully when they called.
"It was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I wanted to surrender.
Lawson, however, "managed to make things a little more positive".
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdonski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"The advantage was that I didn't need directions, I just called them and they accepted me", admits Graham.
The average patient would have to get a referral and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to get the best treatment available.
When such treatments eventually fail, however, many sufferers face yet another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson reached out to Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could be health hazards.
That's when they started talking about corporate dishonesty.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement", according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed, however, that "the asbestos in the basement in question was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying a fatal exposure to asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or have closed.
Insurance records could have been lost.
And the defendants know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs obviously don't.
In response, this year, major new legislation was passed that makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to claim compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that a court could award in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits are expected under this scheme each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good deal" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers", he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time lag had not intervened and mesothelioma patients could track down the companies and sue them in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Secretary of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan acknowledge that with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so badly, and they need help today", Penning said during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdonski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, a tri-therapy in which Lang-Lazdonski boasts a whopping 40 percent five-year survival rate.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"It's certainly one of the most important things", says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some force that's holding you back.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March of 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March.
There were several spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemo.
Now there's no sign of the tumor.
However, the process is physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things like finances, like when I die, or showing my wife how to use the timer on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you get unhappy.
We have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls pretty quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
These are the conversations that every cancer patient has to deal with.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of survival.
This disease carries with it (even, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life threatening.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloths.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase their heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now, a non-flammable canvas has been invented.
I've seen napkins made of it, smoldering in the fireplace at banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos began in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and cloth.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, and soon thereafter in America, Italy, and Russia.
It's the perfect insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Worldwide asbestos production is growing by more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential statistics reveal premature deaths among those who work with asbestos and are denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that asbestos particles in her lungs "were, without a doubt, the principal cause of death".
This is the first case of its kind.
Kershaw's tenants, Turner Bros. Asbestos, have pleaded not guilty.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding was booming, one of the deadliest occupations in terms of asbestos exposure.
Voluntary industrial ban on blue asbestos imports
The Court of Appeal upholds the first successful asbestos-related health claim in the UK.
Worldwide asbestos production is growing to more than 421,300 tons a year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Health and Safety Executive in the UK requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All asbestos use is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act is passed in the UK.
A £350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run in the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to kick off long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People's Congress, in effect, allows the Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't disappoint our expectations, but it still infuriates", said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously, we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing a popular nomination for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by vote, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders have presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to keep the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating commission, which is tightly controlled from Beijing.
And under the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer saw some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is being driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the rally, organizers said their movement was moving to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently to avoid problems with government authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered the possibility of taking the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district will be undoubted.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security at the government headquarters was heightened with police and barricades.
The riots are rooted in the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and free speech are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are putting business at risk, the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protest they are talking about can cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long", said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long been a critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
It's a notion that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong democracy activists have been portrayed as Western-led saboteurs.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people marched in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American prom culture reaches into university life: first-year students are invited to arrive by private plane
We're delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was considering safety.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in dangerously overloaded cars.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesperson said that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks".
The company also said that despite the fact that students are faced with the cost of £9,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for the service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it's more important than ever to make a good first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, the NCS's vice president for higher education, said: "This project seems incredibly detached from most students' lives.
Many students who start university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, where the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is not keeping up with the rapidly rising costs of basic needs, before they can even think about taking out thousands of pounds for something like just arriving at a hostel.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson .
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
People raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot", as they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to advancing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted national attention, Perez saw white women's responses that focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9th assassination, personal essays with headlines like "Ferguson's Thoughts from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, they represented a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege at such a high level", she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because it's so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Coretta Mitchell Ferguson, an English professor at Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell says.
When I write about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships in public but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between questions about race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now integrating issues of race and gender into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always for raping a white woman", Hattery said.
It took a white woman to back up a story to justify a lynching.
From Hattery's perspective, the divide between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all their eggs in the basket of women's suffrage, and black suffrage was to come later", Hattery said.
Looking back on things like this gives us a clearer idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's perspective, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to catch up on the problems that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now beginning to understand what this means.
Two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook to publish a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that called for more white Americans to participate in protests over racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will lead the change", Stynem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates a more cross-cutting feminism that includes issues of race and gender, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinmeier's remarks about Ferguson contradict criticism she has made earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch My Brother", to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, it was met with an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community aren't the only issue pushing the traditional feminist front line.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border this year, immigration reform has resurfaced - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that to make the issue relevant to women, she needed only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are left in a position of vulnerability to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonating with women's organizations", she said.
The Ipswich pig house is for sale.
A photo of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was discovered to show a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120,000, a one-bedroom detached house on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photograph of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on the sofa.
Connells Real Estate says the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has been deleted", the company said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique detached house with one bedroom".
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still in advertising material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Karolin Voznatski in the fourth round of the US Open, feels she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year and try to reach a new level, Vasily Osipov reports from New York.
How would you rate your overall performance in this year's Grand Slam tournaments?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I was not stable enough, especially at the end of some matches.
I'm upset right now, of course.
I didn't even make it to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After an upset defeat, I have a huge motivation to take it to the next level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm gonna do everything I can to finish the year on a high note.
The Asian series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuyev proposed to give bonuses for compliance with the GTO norms when entering universities.
According to him, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will be taking up the standards for lifting, running and other exercises.
We remind you that 12 Russian regions will start to introduce GTO regulations on their territory from September 1.
I also suggested that students who passed the GTO should be given bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, you can give them a little extra credit for the SAT.
There are also proposals to give extra time off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
A new millionaire has emerged in Harvey , South Wales , after winning the lottery .
Lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southwest Perth, where one lucky winner took home almost $1.1 million from a Saturday night lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey brings home gold in the main event for the second time in five years, with the last win being $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to announce himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought that this kind of win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five August millionaires, following a massive $7.5 million win by a Belmont couple just weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of winners of the Western Australian Grand Prix to 59 this year, with a total prize pool of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Oleg Pluzhnikov, deputy director of the department, at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Auto Show 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the government, and one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September or early October, Plugnikov said, and the proposed measures concern electric and hybrid vehicles - a plan to develop gas-powered vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is at Vedomosti) is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport will need to be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme for preferential lending and leasing will be published by April 2015; and proposals for lowering car prices, stimulating localization and building service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is proposed to amend the normative legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking lots, petrol stations and others).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to regional governments during 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally friendly transportation, such as driving and parking benefits, and by February 2016 to expand public procurement.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure into the list of indicators for evaluating the activities of regional authorities by October 2014.
The electric car market in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013 about 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
The import duty on electric cars will be zeroed in early 2014, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts Mitsubishi Motors' chief executive director in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But even five-fold growth doesn't make electric cars any less noticeable: In 2013, Russia sold 2.78 million passenger and light commercial vehicles, according to the European Business Association.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company is focused primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remis, Renault's director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia.
Most other electric vehicle manufacturers have been waiting on Russia.
Russian manufacturers have developed electric vehicles - "", GAZ, "", but the output is meager.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of engineering of "AutoVAZ" Sergey Amanov, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to the high cost of cars (electric cars sold in Russia are twice as expensive as those with internal combustion engines), is holding back the underdeveloped charging infrastructure (fuel tanks - units), sighs Sergey Целиков, the general director of "Autostat".
Due to the high cost and low cost of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the chief editor of "Autoreview" Mikhail Podrozhanskiy, and he agrees with him.
Carmakers, on the other hand, say that some electric models are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rosseti": several stations have been built in Moscow, and soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations are underway with other regions to build a network of filling stations.
According to RosSetey's director Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build filling stations across the country, but there are also problems: the small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, is being worked out the possibility of doing so in relation to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the zeroing of customs duties to be the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric car market in Russia.
The zero rate will be in place until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, expanding the list of benefits, is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangibly as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in electric car sales - now accounting for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov believes, or the ability to move electric cars along designated lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private plane crashed in Colorado .
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people on board died, reports ITAR-TASS.
Survivors are being taken to the hospital.
The crash happened a few miles from the runway of Denver International Airport.
The cause of the tragedy is being investigated.
In the Donetsk region, they are dealing with the captive militants of the Donbass battalion.
The Karatelites were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security personnel were killed in the firing.
Those who survived said that if they had known what the situation was like in southeastern Ukraine, they would not have gone to war.
The 108 prisoners are lucky.
The punishers from the battalion "Donbass" survived after the "meat cutting" they got under Ilovaisk.
The militants spent several days surrounded by the army of the Donetsk people's republic, in fact abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters announced that the ring could be left through a supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But within minutes, shells and bullets were whistling from all sides.
"According to the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave", says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we went down into the lowlands between Multipol and Chervonoselsky, crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, from "beakers", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic cannons, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says that at least 60 people were killed almost immediately, dozens were wounded, many died later.
The surviving fighters are now being treated by the same people they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders have basically deceived them and condemned them to certain death.
They say we were betrayed.
A column, a whole battalion, to destroy it.
Like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered for the Donbass battalion because the Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed by separatists in the southeast.
Here, Alexei saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, and not by anyone but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was mortar fire, that it was probably Ukrainian armed forces", says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They wouldn't let us out of Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, I've already written the report on the departure.
We were taken from the Zurahov collections to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "boiler" near Ilovaisk.
Now, some survivors admit that if they could turn back time, they would not have joined the punishment battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR forces.
Everyone will be tested for war crimes.
The region has a headquarters for food price control
In Krasnoyarsk Territory, a headquarters has been established, which will limit the growth of food prices in the region's market if necessary.
The decree on the creation of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive and supervisory authorities.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev pay back $140 million in losses to Rosneft?
Rosneft's head Igor Sechin said the company estimated the damage from the Lisichny oil refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He told Spiegel about this.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation", Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichan NPP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, no 'buried rebels,' but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the process oil pumped into the pipes is missing", he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichany refinery, the tank for storing oil burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichan refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the plant was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the standard "Euro-4", as well as a batch of diesel fuel of the standard "Euro-5".
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisichan refinery was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichan refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, the incident occurred around 10:30 am local time from the Chongdo province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.

The US dollar is trading 23 cents above the official exchange rate, the euro is trading 16 cents above the official exchange rate.
The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, August 29, but there was no panic this time.
He kept the ruble cheaper and even updated the historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like a man-made hysteria being inflated by the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may adjust.
Orenburg Airlines is suing Ideal-tour
"Orenburg Airlines" has filed a claim against "Ideal-tour" for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We're talking about two cases that are scheduled to go to trial in October.
There'll be different judges.
According to the Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
It's worth a little over 425 million rubles.
The hearing is set for October 7.
The second application was filed on August 18.
It is worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The hearing is set for October 2nd.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union of Tourist Industry, the judges are appointed differently.
In July, the media reported that Ideal-tour had debts of 1.5 billion rubles to Orenburg Airlines.
The airline's CEO, Viktor Zhukin, said the amount was 1.6 billion rubles.
The director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, says the amount is even larger - two billion rubles.
Twitter is trying to be more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the registration process to get new users to engage more quickly with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandon their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be able to browse a large number of recommended accounts while signing up to build their reading circle.
The recommendations are based on the interests indicated when registering.
Twitter automatically ticks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
This will force the user to manually remove the tick to avoid reading the ones he is not interested in.
Whereas previously users of the microblogging service only saw avatars of recommended users, Twitter now displays a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help create an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter sign-up page in three years.
Twitter has been working hard to modernize its service recently.
This activity is primarily due to the service's ongoing efforts to achieve profitability.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company is in dire need of more loyal customer resources that, once they're there, they'll stick around.
It's the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising funds.

The program to recycle cars resumed on September 1
From September 1, the program for the recycling of cars in Russia is resumed.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other support directions.
The program will cover all vehicles over six years old.
The compensation amount will be from 40 thousand for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Previously, Russia had a similar program for recycling cars.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is not only envisaged to recycle cars to obtain a later discount, but also the possibility in case the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when handing over the old one to the dealer, "Interfax" reports.
The previous federal program of recycling, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, spent more than 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light vehicles in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million pieces (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator is releasing a game about modern journalism .
Game designer Nikki Case, known for Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only now that it's become public knowledge.
The game was inspired by events in Ferguson, where protests have been taking place since a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The project, which has no title yet, will focus on how news coverage of stories affects their impact.
The protagonist, a citizen journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in the areas where clashes occur between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he makes the scene look like the police are heroes and the protesters are thugs, the police will start treating him better and let him go where the average person can't go.
If he covers events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a full-scale riot.
The game will have to score points using the character's Twitter account, which will add new followers if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The release date and platforms are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image showing how an event can change depending on how the photo of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the US, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
But when he saw the media coverage of Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on it.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which is based on events in Case's own life, is about a bisexual teenager trying to tell his homophobic parents about his relationship.
Geletei is dragging Ukraine into the bloodshed
Calling for preparations for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Geletey is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletey, who declared the "completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War", which will have casualties in the "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by non-military experts", the Russian diplomats said.
They find it hard to believe that such statements could come from the Secretary of Defense of a civilized nation.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian defense minister wrote on Monday: "Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us".
He said that the "operation to liberate the east of Ukraine" was completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all the celebrity photos and apologized .
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars were horrified.
Hackers cracked the primitive iCloud passwords on smartphones, and their intimate photos were posted on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
I mean, not for long.
The official spokesperson for the star of "The Hunger Games" Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her mobile phone, and confirmed that all the photos that "shine" on the Internet are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the founder of the tabloid website of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their candid photos, The Independent reports.
No, no one made me do it.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
Now I'm going to delete the nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice", the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already been floated around the web.
David Beckham was in a car accident while hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident while running from the paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at a corner on Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer has recovered from a sprain and a sprain of his right arm.
Beckham walked out of the tattoo parlor, where the paparazzi were waiting for him.
While evading their pursuit on a motorcycle, he lost control of the steering wheel and fell, TMZ reports, citing sources close to the footballer.
As a result, Beckham suffered a contusion, stretching of the muscles of his right arm and a scratch.
Tony Stewart has an accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended just over halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire ruptured on lap 172, ending his performance.
Stuart drove his broken-down car to the garage and then left without speaking to reporters.
His team manager Chad Johnston said the 14 members of the team are upset but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there had been a better attempt and a better finish for him", said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty high expectation of getting to the finish line", Johnston said, adding, "I just didn't".
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto an airlift, and the team was packed and ready to go.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt track race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get into the Chase.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had gone out on the track to complain to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash will continue for at least two more weeks.
A decision on whether to charge Stuart has not been made.
The three-time champion was met with loud cheers and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart, the number is Bush.
Car 18 went off the road at the exit of turn 2 and hit Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but fell behind to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vittorgan have a cigarette breakfast with Zvanecki in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are currently in Odessa, the TV presenter wrote on her Instagram.
However, one photo was very surprising and very confusing to fans of the couple.
The photo was taken at Zvanecki's.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhailovich Zvanecki's Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) #odessa", - wrote the photo of Ksenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter and no other...
The couple's fans thought that Kyusha also smoked and condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?", "Smoking kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast") ", "It looks like breakfast, but there are only cigarettes on the table))) ", "Xenia, do you smoke too?", - her blog subscribers were excited about their favorite.
Recall that Sobchak recently boasted about the delicious dinner Maxim Vitorgan prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the country house,and your husband has prepared dinner for you (for the first time in your married life,because it is delicious).
The picture shows Maxim preparing something diligently, and the table is already set with salted and baked chicken.
Prison officials in Bulgaria hold national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from across Bulgaria held a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the country's capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also among the demands that will be discussed with acting Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers held symbolic protests against the new work schedule, demanding the return of 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison workers' union met with the Ministry of Justice several times, no agreement was reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The negotiations are continuing, said Rossen Zhelyazkov, head of the BPR's Chief Penal Executive.
The prison workers' union is expected to join the protest from the Federation of the Interior Ministry Employees' Unions.
The army controls the new government in Thailand
General Prajut (right) appointed as Defence Minister Pravit Vongsuwan (left)
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, which has more than a third of its posts held by retired generals.
Army representatives were given key positions as ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the king of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the prime minister's post.
He was elected prime minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed parliamentary deputies.
According to Prayuth Chan-och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
The civil power is completely paralyzed.
The leaders of the main political parties were placed under temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army removed the prime minister's brother Yingluck Shinawatra from office.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has often ensured their success in elections.
However, many of the middle class and the capital's elite have joined the anti-government movement that has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said clams would be better in a salad, I didn't promise you that, jokes the waitress at the new Palm bra.
You have to admit it's true, but the mind and the stomach are still adamant.
We all know that when we say Belgium, we mean mussels.
Restaurateurs like to say, deep down, that the success of a restaurant depends on three things: location, location, and location.
There are places that are not so good, even great, but some unlucky.
As I sat down at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a café called Town (in honor of the same TV show), then Odessa-Mom, and then a restaurant called Bojolle and a beer house called Friendship.
Now it's a beer house again, but not nostalgic Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground, only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's like a nursery, with red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, and TVs with mermaid girls swimming in them instead of windows.
Belgian restaurants in St. Petersburg are not new, so there's a lot to compare them to.
There are eight kinds of beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A company-minded waitress entertains the menu by saying that "mosses are a big, filling seed", and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Who, for example, could have guessed that a meat roll with Walloon black plum (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper would look ugly thick compared to it?
You can only taste a little taste if you stir half a plate.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be the most accurate to declare a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of scrawny iceberg, a potato boiled a long time ago, a bunch of Kenyan beans, a bunch of bacon chips, and some pickled onions.
You're not gonna wish you met anyone with a salad like that.
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were somewhat different, but the impression was also positive.
If you could turn a blind eye to underripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or toasted mushrooms, why do mussels look as if they've been thawed and boiled several times in their lifetime?
I already know there are normal sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one with the white wine, celery and carrots, I'm not sure I'm getting it.
There are vegetables, but no scent, and whether there was wine is a mystery.
But the clam-based fries with homemade mayonnaise are good.
The chicken water here is not a loaf of bread, so thick that depending on your mood, you can decide whether it's the first or second course in front of you, but just a nice little whipped cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked by a local chef in a beer sauce, and there was no mention of rosemary.
When I checked, the situation was the opposite: Rosemary was a silencer.
It was thought that this rabbit was fed only rosemary bushes during its life, which is why the meat has such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit's leg was also attached to a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelised shell.
Waffles at Palm are not only sweet but also filling - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery and the waffles were dry.
But the manager approached the table and asked very informally about the experience of the dinner.
Then we should come again.
The dollar rose above 37 rubles on the news of the new sanctions against Russia.
That's a new record.
The dollar by "tomorrow" at 10:29 am grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to the data of the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket rose by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum value on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The ruble's weakness is long-term, both with the euro and the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, - says senior analyst of "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Anything that has to do with Ukraine will be reflected in the courses one way or another.
As long as this goes on, investors will respond.
Today, the rumors of the invasion of the troops are not confirmed by either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was erased yesterday.
The week, according to the expert, will close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax season is over, oil prices are low, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all links in the same chain.
Inflation is also expected to rise by 5 to 10 percent in the fall.
Soon, too, seasonal fruits and vegetables will run out, leaving a vacuum as the networks refocus on other suppliers.
"The dollar has reached the 37-ruble mark, passed it and returned, there is no powerful hysteria", said Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department at the Opening Broker.
It remains to be seen if the sanctions promised on Saturday will be imposed when NATO meets.
The ruble, he said, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then came the news about Ukraine, besides, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year it was completely moving to a floating exchange rate and refusing any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was scared by the 37 rubles mark, - continues the analyst.
So, nothing major happened in terms of turnover.
The currency market was in a troubled time, as I recall, when demand for currency was high in late January and also on March 3 when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC sees the positive side of the ruble's weakening.
First of all, this is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in import prices, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
The rise in the price of imported goods and services is a negative factor.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investments in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause the rise in the cost of borrowing money, which in turn slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble smooths out the decline in the price of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell 1.67 percent in Thursday's trading, while the RTS Index dropped 3.27 percent.
The significant difference in the relative decline of the indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The ruble's weakening is emotional and is explained by a mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually fade away, and the ruble's price appreciation partially or completely restores lost positions.
"We think that soon we will be able to see the dollar-Russian currency ratio near the level of 36 rubles per dollar", - says Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
The Briton said she spent years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Caryn Rogers spent much of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of inherited disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reports that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have PTSD, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait and pinched toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition is not curable and progresses, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do what others could.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school for my walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to free her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor came out of the room, and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I had stuck my nose where it didn't belong, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association", she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic that could be experienced.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something that's a lot less life-threatening.
After a few genetic tests, they found a C.M.T.
"When he explained what the SPC was, I thought I had a lucky ticket", she said.
The UK charity CKD has launched CKD awareness month to try to raise awareness of the disease.
The tax burden on Washington businessmen is rising as the economy recovers .
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country have risen moderately in the past year as the economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden last year increased 4.3 percent to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third straight year of growth after back-to-back years of declining bills in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study that was conducted by the professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia, at 28 percent, brings the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
The tax revenue growth is largely driven by companies returning to previous levels of property values, researchers say, which have raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While a large share of these revenues are in large states like California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the previous year.
However, the observed return on property value has no similar effect on the increase in tax revenue at the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofits that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the state's Tax Center.
So Maryland has to rely on much more, like income taxes to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be entirely explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also seem to be improving, according to this data.
Companies in the region filed a $2.3 billion statewide corporate income tax return, up $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are in one direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 percent, whereas growth in Maryland was much faster, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a lower-than-average 4.1 percent increase in tax revenue.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each of which had the same corporate rate), at 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the District it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local levels and a generally more favorable climate for entrepreneurs when it comes to taxes than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this bill could bring the corporate income tax rate even higher to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better and thus paying more in state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
The taxes for entrepreneurs paid as individual income taxes by small business owners -- the transitional structure that most small businesses are built on -- in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than the taxes for entrepreneurs overall.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with state and local sales tax revenues up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may fall behind as federal spending cuts affect the region's labor market.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The domestic world championship in judo brought Russia's national team two silver and seven bronze medals.
In this indicator, the Russians only lost to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese national team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Beslan Mudranov won the title in the 60 kg weight category.
In the final match against Mongol Baldbaatar Ganbat, the outcome of the match was decided by a single remark made by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday three medals were won at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, Mikhail Pulaev won silver, and Kamal Khan-Magomedov bronze.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion of 2011 and 2013 Masashi Ebinuma of Japan.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarterfinals, won the consolation tournament and became the bronze medalist.
In the women's 52 kg category, Natalya Kuzyutyna also reached the third podium.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the reigning world champion Maylinde Kelmendi from Kosovo, who was representing the International Judo Federation at the championships and successfully defended her title.
In the bronze medal match, Kuzyutyna beat Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she had hoped for.
And once again, the obstacle on the way to the gold was Kelmendi, who had defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Moguchkov, who fought in the 73 kg category, won bronze in the Russian national team's pool.
In the quarter-finals, he was beaten by former Moldova representative Viktor Skvortsov, who now plays for the UAE.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov was playing in his home tournament with a calf injury that he plans to heal soon, so he's taking a break from competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he at this tournament reached the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots who has taken the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarerenko, also finished with a bronze in the 100kg category.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Championship also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifonov won in the 81 kg category.
In a tough battle in the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmidt with a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
It was won by Kirill Voprosov, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: rival Voprosov could not go out on tatami because of injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the reserve of the team by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean sweep of Brazilian David Moura.
So ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the title of world champions in team competitions was played.
Both Russian teams - men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the award, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex did not fare as well - they did not reach the medal.
The Russian judo team won silver.
In the decisive match, they lost to the main favourites of the competition - the Japanese team.
At the same time , the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and a strong-willed - Denis Yartsov (weight up to 73 kg).
However , in the heavier weight categories , Murat Khabacherov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) failed to beat their Japanese rivals .
The same scenario was followed by the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament ended congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is a great honor, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions", Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
Losing to the Japanese, the founders of judo, is nothing to be ashamed of.
But I'm sure you can win.
The Russian national team at the World Cup in its home country performed much better than a year ago at the similar level competitions held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was not attended by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isayev.
We're all great maximalists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, then he is a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in such a sport as judo", - summed up the tournament by the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various values, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will be held in the summer of next year in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family is hopeful for the best .
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had suffered cardiac arrest at the Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, the sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "severe".
The response was broad, including a large online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Reep.
All kings can
The debut album from Royal Blood is on sale, the new hope of British rock, bringing rock duos from clubs straight to the stadiums.
Royal Blood has been on stage for just over a year, but they've already earned a nomination for a BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour with Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract to release it is in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current dismal state of the music industry, it's a strange situation, because this isn't the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-talking representative of the new R'n'B, but a duo of British-looking bulls playing at the same level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album were particularly high and justified.
The duo has a name that's been taken advantage of by a few desperate hairy metal fans, and the blood of kings they think runs through their veins is clear.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set out to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.
It's probably too early to predict the success of this venture, but there are some things we can say.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes or less is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the virtues of the individual tracks, of course, cannot be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by being remembered not for the melodic line, but for the drum part.
Musicians joke that this song is actually easier to tune than to sing.
Also worth noting is the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
But the truth is, each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they all blend into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, quite the opposite.
Royal Blood's strength is that they don't claim the accolades of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather aiming for the successors to Motörhead), but have brought numerous rock duos out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, while varied, is designed for stadiums, a space designed for fewer than a couple thousand people, and it's obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented in the early days of The White Stripes.
However, it is not just the instruments that matter, but also the very approach to songwriting.
The retro rock heroes of the Zeroes had a hard time breaking out of the postmodern paradigm, and were reluctant to recognize themselves as independent creative entities rather than mere epigons.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and bold that this stress successfully drapes some of the secondary and hard-hitting nature of the music material.
After all, who says rock's got to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying streaming video service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for a billion dollars seemed complete, and it seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general-purpose streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time gaming", according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mostly old) games a treatment, like in "Mystery Theater", is already popular on YouTube.
The thing is, YouTube is mentioned a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a well-established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay as little as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster".
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick.
It's one thing to watch a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are for one person, so watching them without controlling the viewing angle can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I'll admit, the speed runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless it's a game or a comedy genius, it's unlikely his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it's the fourth-largest peak Internet traffic source.
How exactly is Amazon going to make money off of this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would fold into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: the crowd of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the channel shows no signs of fading, even as a - oh - spectacular sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the surviving hostages - almost all of them are now students, with the parents of the dead, with the keeper of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatow, the head of the committee "Mother of Beslan" Susanna Dudiyeva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergencies, - says the correspondent of the department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, we met Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the president's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "V" department of the Russian FSB Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What really struck me about working on this is that Beslan didn't seem to exist for 10 years.
It's a painful subject for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it hard to talk about what happened.
The experience is very difficult.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job", Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the Rambler & Co. studio, which has been working at the company since spring.
Previous special projects have been devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's rise to power.
North Korea launches short-range rocket
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, Renhap reports.
The launch was made around 10.30am local time from the province of Changdo, on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile is believed to have fallen into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative succeeds, data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The draft law was introduced in the State Duma, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is in the legislative activity database of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadym Denegin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Justice Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
According to the authors of the initiative, this change will contribute to a more efficient and effective protection of the rights of Russian citizens to the protection of personal data and the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which parliamentarians are rushing to enact, requires that personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be stored on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, clarify and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation in the field of personal data on the basis of a court decision.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of violating websites - an automated information system "Register of violators of personal data subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrey Lugovoy and Vadim Denkin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Dengen and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in Russia will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems in postponing the date of entry into force of the law on personal data protection.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies, which today already provide their servers".
"In addition, there are several independent data centers willing to cooperate in this area", he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to operate in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will get technological opportunities to be located", Levin summed up.
The controversial bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, online booking of airline tickets and hotels is a concern.
According to the association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The statement of the RAEEC emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, the child can choose where the activities will be carried out.
The adoption of similar laws on "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the decline of global services and significant economic losses.

Militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to Ukrainian military
The Novorussia Army claims to have shot down a Ukrainian Su-27 and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As of 10:00 on 1 September, the militiamen have handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom are wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya".
He added that "the air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereshkash shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreement".
According to the agency's source, the Ukrainian side used cassette ammunition banned by international conventions in the artillery shelling of the Luhansk airport.
The spokesman for the press service noted that the militiamen managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force on one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition stores.
"The enemy's casualties are up to 100 killed and wounded, 13 surrendered", the headquarters said.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire.
At the same time, during the night, the DPR army, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", "intercepted the attempt of the national guards to withdraw heavy equipment from the surrounding area in violation of the previously reached agreements".
Then the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a quick fight, capturing six tanks and disarming 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupolsk) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militiamen in the Ilovaisk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leaders of the "people's republics" to release the Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that they hand over their weapons and ammunition to the enemy.
The first dozen soldiers began leaving the besieged settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defense battalion "Donbass" Semyon Semenchenko, who was surrounded, 14 more people came out of the "boiler" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity with the 137th regiment of the 32nd Russian Division and the 9th Russian tank brigade", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports from the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take countermeasures if EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said the European Council's "conclusions" of August 30 showed the EU's inability to overcome the inertia of its unabashed support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven claims about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country", the ministry's website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties", the ministry stresses.
The website of the ministry also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is increasing.
Recall that within the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against Russia .
The EU is working closely with US officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures introduced with each other in terms of duration and severity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
How to Save on University Textbooks
With college textbooks costing more than $1,000 a year for many students, Matt Schroeder, who is about to enter his second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math textbook, which normally costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie", says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but students have a number of options for reducing those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often costing significantly less than buying one.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book sales have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the past spring semester, says Trevor Meyer, vice president of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a good deal.
Shopping online
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you'd see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 per price tag, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Buying used
If you don't mind any scratches or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Analytic" is for sale for $93.49 in second hand on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Media Strategic Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business".
The book sold for $48 a new one.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, urge students to ask their professors if they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are not essential to the class.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Rented
You should consider renting textbooks if you are good enough to handle them, remember to return them and not want to keep them after the course.
You can save over 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Analysis of Mathematics" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the bookstore where you pick up the books, including any fines you may be subjected to for marks, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fine may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting "Analytic Math" on Chegg.com for six months is going to cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, since many classics are now available for free download, whereas literature in the natural sciences and engineering can be quite expensive.
Look around, no matter what.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start law school at Pepperdine, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before ordering online, Galt says, make sure the book is in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
The book he bought was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said the Far East Development Fund is completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained in deposits", the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary to create the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, has not approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the region's transport accessibility, removing infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, it is necessary to create conditions for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form advanced development territories that should become competitive with key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the president stressed.
It was previously reported that the area of advanced development could replace the SEZ.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Couldn't Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone's Unstoppable 3 brought in less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing For brought in only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Home Video with Cameron Diaz only brought in $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 also disappointed.
Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 the "worst" year ever for children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of every film that went on sale in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May Day holiday and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both filmgoers and film critics, suggest that this year's film output is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming services like Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney movie "The Jungle Book", told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing".
We have to face that and not try to go back to the way things were.
In contrast to the current decline in Hollywood box office, Netflix's streaming revenue reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises and predicted Hollywood's "crash".
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that his grim predictions were true to some extent.
With several potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other industry figures are more optimistic.
"X-Men" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the box office decline "just cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever, and nobody's going to worry about it".
Food sanctions don't scare the owners of Caucasian and Central Asian restaurants, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And in general, the general public prefers to replace the banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella", laments Mariano Valerio, the chef at Barlotti, an Italian restaurant, about the quality of cheeses suppliers offer him instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese are the first to go, they have a short shelf life.
We should have enough parmesan for a couple more months.
What do you want to do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio's eyes are so clear, the shocking memories still haunt him.
The meat was lying on the carts just a foot off the floor!
There are cats!
The rats!
Then I said that we would never buy anything for our restaurant from the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed there now.
But the other day I got a sample of fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be a stone!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought us this.
Valerio is surprised that many of the usual things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the stranger.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, they hang meat in a refrigerator for 10 days at 1 to 2 degrees.
It has to hang down to make it soft, so the muscles relax.
I made it all with local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said, that's your Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
Five minutes' walk from Barlotti, the French restaurant Brasserie Pont has a stop sign in the kitchen that lists missing items: French oysters, sea urchins.
The chef of Brasserie Most and Bar Strelka, Regis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: French oysters have already been replaced by Tunisian oysters, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
Regis, however, becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Cabbage is 200 rubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make some money too".
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy far eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it turns out to be a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality dropped dramatically".
Main complaints: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don't know what will happen to them when the cheese runs out

Sanctioned menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are called mainly food sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pork, meat and poultry products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants are struggling with suppliers, with rising food prices and the urgent need to find similar products in other countries.
The most affected are the expensive restaurants with monokitches in France, Italy and Spain, which were supplied directly from their "mother" countries.
The public sector has had to rebuild before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef, and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers began to ship beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in the summer of 2014 were much more severe.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that remove the ban on salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes the sanctions can be eased further.
But for now, some restaurants are in a state of uncertainty.
According to the East-West Company, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Demanding restaurants will have to change their menus to those produced by local farmers and other countries", says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of the agency Restkonsalt.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We're just short of chefs, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel at Brasserie Bridge is ready to do that. He'll have to give up 10 to 15 percent of his meals, rework half the menu.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, people are already starting to replace meals such as marble beef steak with beefstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentine, Tunisian, Chilean cheeses", says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West Company.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the U.S. can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and Norway salmon, salmon, Norway trout, and trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European produce can be compensated for by domestic produce, as well as offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to restructure than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian go there.
Although it's going to be hard for the Ginza Project, he says.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace", says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes serving Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that the products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than those from Europe.
But there are plenty of restaurants that are barely affected.
These include the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine", says Khatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vay me!".
All our cheeses are made in Russia, and many dishes are based on chicken fillet, and we don't use exotic greens".
The Kolbai's have not removed a single dish from their menu yet.
Timur Lanskiy, owner of the Chaihon N1 Uzbek restaurants, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will only have to exchange lamb for New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even gain in price, for us it will be cheaper than importing from Europe", he says.
You can get the cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits cheaper from the CIS.
And what they bring from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
Everyone knows that Uzbek tomatoes are tasty, sweet.
No one says that in Spanish.
After the sanctions were imposed, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan have announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were imposed.
Fast food restaurants that responded to the Money request are also responding quite calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald's said that localization is over 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 percent of the network's products are sourced in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with vegetable supplies and rising prices for meat products, which are made from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, the "sanctioned products" were generally no more than 4%.
Not the sanctions or the Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potatoes did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants claim that Burger King is significantly less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hump
Meanwhile, restaurant owners complain that the increase in demand has pushed up prices even for local food.
"The prices of food for the "Grables" have risen on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherri Mio" - by two times", says restaurant owner Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August".
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork", complains Sergey Rak, vice president of StarDogs.
Chicken curd is up 35%.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll cool the hot Brazilian heads.
Soon, the Stardogs will be planning an 8% price increase.
"It's not a good idea to raise prices", says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of the public food revenue in the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8%.
That's the lowest number since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurants are stocking up on food for the next two months in the hope of coping with falling purchase prices.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall, there are a dozen tents decorated with green and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians are playing the waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the fun title "It's Time to Eat".
"We were planning to celebrate local food for a long time, but the sanctions came, so we hurried to organize the festival", says one of the organizers.
Behind the scenes with the musicians, Greek chef Anastasios is making a salad of pasta and homemade candy, the other day there was a workshop on making a borsch with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from the Republic of Bashkiria, deer meat from Salehard, vegetables from the Lenin-named Sovkhos in Moscow, cheese from the Italian Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by other salmon from the Far East", says Phillip Galkin, owner of the fish shop "Swami People".
We have had a lot of catches of herring, herring, sprat, humpback, king salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fatty as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is a fish farmer.
You hold it, it doesn't even move.
And our far eastern salmon you can't keep in your hands.
Only the ones without any particular complaints are willing to replace Italian mozzarella with a domestic one .
In the window of his tent are shrimp with the mark "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, shrimp from the Crimea, shrimp from the Far East.
Galkin thinks it's time to switch to far eastern fishing.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the USA.
Fish imports in 2013 were about 800,000 tons.
The shop "Svoje ljudi" has been operating since 2012, sells fish through an online store, before the sanctions were imposed, it served another dozen and a half restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
Now Galkin has applications from 15 other restaurants.
"You can make the same sushi from our fish", he says.
We've been working on it, trying different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
I'm getting a serving of Philadelphia ketones at Galkin's tent to confirm.
Unlike the salmon rolls, these take longer to chew, but the fact that this fish is our own, our own, gives us strength.
The website of the shop "My People" even has rolls of coat and sea bass.
In sushi bars, though, they prefer to substitute Chilean for Norwegian salmon.
Galkin explains that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for fish from the Far East.
"We have not been offered Russian fish by suppliers yet", explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev.
The situation is similar with other products: Russian producers could have taken up the niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now it is more likely to replace imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are big multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace the prohibited imports unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit mainly the large producers of other countries", Akimov says.
However, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions in the past month.
Following the massive unplanned inspections, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are investigating the nature of the complaints to determine the actions necessary to reopen the restaurants to visitors as soon as possible", McDonald's press office told Money.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If it's all about food sanctions, that's one option that can be survived", said an employee of a restaurant consulting firm who asked not to be named.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, it's a whole different story.
"Euro-protocol" instead of the DHS reference
Payments by casco will be possible without a GIBDD certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Euro-protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guideline according to which from September 1 this year, the insured motorist will be able to do without a GIBD certificate to receive payments for the helmet.
It is true that we are only talking about cases where the accident was registered under the "European protocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
So if there were only two cars involved in the accident, no one was physically injured, the damage was within the designated limit, and both drivers agreed on who was to blame for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Euro-protocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that even in the case of minor injuries, in situations where the accident can be registered under the "European protocol", the drivers involved in the accident often call the traffic police.
Because if you had a helmet policy, you couldn't get reimbursement without a DHS certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of introducing the "Euro-protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for a crash without the help of the DHS should not be lower than the limit of the "European Protocol".
However, it cannot be higher than the limit set in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically can relieve both traffic and roadwork.
But it's not likely to please drivers or insurance companies.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of increased fraud, which may be caused by the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for drivers, it is hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will often wait hours for the inspector to report a minor accident because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known which will be easier - to defeat the fraudsters or convince the drivers of the reliability of the "European protocol".
The savings certificate will be made anonymous and irrevocable
The Treasury wants to ban deposit-only certificates, but it's going to allow banks to make them look like a permanent deposit.
The Treasury is drafting a bill that would ban the issuance of savings certificates.
The latter has been gaining popularity as the rates are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that the deposit insurance system does not cover the depositors' savings certificates, and they are cheaper for the bank because you do not have to make a deposit into the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The piquant thing is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow's share, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the bank explains, is that customers of a small bank that has bought a certificate like this try to get money from the bank if the bank revokes its license.
Some depositors, who are not financially literate enough to buy a savings certificate on the holder's behalf, may assume that their investment is insured.
The lack of insurance payments for these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency's practice, there have been cases where holders of pre-presentation certificates have tried to collect insurance compensation through the court", the agency said.
The problem, of course, is made up.
Because no one will pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, because they are not legally entitled to reimbursement from the state.
If the instrument were not insured in the ASV, the ban would also apply to metal accounts where citizens' funds are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts don't get into the deposit insurance system either, but they're not being investigated.
The fact is, most likely, that the certificate of title is a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-currency.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any bank customer can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing out, such a certificate can change many owners.
It's no coincidence that the bill says that a savings certificate must be a registered security that must be kept in a depository.
And to sweeten the pot for the banks, they're allowed to issue certificates without the right to early redemption.
So, the kind of no-deposit deposit that bankers have been dreaming about for a long time.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests over the weekend against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the weekend for us and spoke to protesters who had come from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq .
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31 with reference to the decision taken at the meeting of the representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 of its "Milan" anti-tank rockets and 500 rounds of ammunition to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1st, Mrs. Merkel will make a government statement on this subject in the Bundestag.
Germany has not yet delivered its weapons to the hot spots.
The German public's opinion on the arms shipment to Iraq was divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that the weapons could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militiamen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militiamen shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31.
According to the available data, it happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokin and Bezymenno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats were fired upon.
The incident occurred today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
The teenagers were picked up by helicopter from the Blue Mountains .
TWO teenage bushwalkers were flown by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking shortly after noon on Sunday in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they didn't return home.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the couple was found around 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl injured her knee and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were lifted on the ledge on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions have met .
The summit in Minsk did not solve the problems for which it was called, but it gave birth to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian Economic Union
Although alarming (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerating delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot issues" for the first time.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear, but it is clear who took the cream out of the summit.
The questions fell on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and then other Eurasians with Europeans saw the new president Lukashenko in the news.
The Belarusian leader set an example of refined courtesy, the behavior of a man who just won the jackpot - and is planning a dignified retirement in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - is not just legitimizing the president with a 20-year experience.
It is an application to recognize Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw", he told "Ogyna".
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparing for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results have been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa simplification and readmission, dialogues on modernization", the source of the report said.
The states even lifted some of the sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only fueled this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militiamen in Donbas with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union, nor the CSTO, and in Baranovich is a Russian airbase.
Brussels and Washington have noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and have assessed it, Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful Lukashenko's move towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often Minsk will host EU+TC meetings in the near future.
The press service of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the new format of relations.
Ashton Maya Kosyancic, the press secretary, told the paper that the issue was not a priority in the context of the war and peace.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could be the next meeting place for the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The final straw for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked to do so by the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" is now a fully-fledged European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, had already made the point that the summit was not about the tragic situation in Donbas, but about the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future gas talks and the overcoming of fears of the EU countries over Ukraine's EU association agreement is a far greater achievement than the peace declarations without specific dates or figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, pointed out that EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around".
However, it seems that the crisis in Ukraine is also working on Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuvering.
According to the head of the Mizeus Research Center, ex-presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's opportunities to supply agricultural products to Russia bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, the supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit has booed Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes", Romanchuk stressed to "Ognika", "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have been working on schemes to supply goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of some way to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are keen to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with an orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand".
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU-TC negotiating platform is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He reminds that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered only 125 million euros of compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president may suggest that Brussels work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's credibility in the EU to an unprecedented level.
Hospitality Without Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk is distancing itself from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to come together, without any fuss, to discuss, not from a bay, to make a decision, after signing the Association Treaty with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time", he told Petro Poroshenko before the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which was initially rumored to be against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic service emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when it organizes the EU and the Customs Union on its soil, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other areas, in particular in the security sphere, the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation, is promoting", - said "Ognika" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the agency where recently meticulously choose the words.
Moscow may have paid entry zones
The Moscow government is considering the introduction of toll-free zones as a method of combating congestion on central roads, as in other major cities around the world, reports M24.ru, citing Moscow's deputy mayor for transport issues Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proven itself to be successful is paying for admission.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made", Lixutov said.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and volume to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of a central ring road, Lixutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is a case in point for not having to run all traffic through Moscow.
If there were enough infrastructure for a bypass, there would be no need for transit traffic in Moscow", the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Likutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly relieved the capital streets.
And, he said, the city government is not planning to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobyanin, took part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CROW).
Boredom is sinful.
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City 2: The Woman to Kill For did not revolutionize the world as you might expect.
The first Sin City (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it breaks the fundamental chain of thesis-antithesis-synthesis for modern thinking (if we understand thesis as the noir universe, and antithesis as the comic book cosmos).
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
Sin City 2 is chaotic on both the dramatic and the philosophical levels: both times it's chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first "City", although, here, the bully Marv (Micky Rourke), remembers, died in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to grab - as a folk soldier - from the air knives and other axes with strangulation.
But the old people are literally being elbowed by the newcomers, like they're breaking into town from some other movie, whose meaning and plot the audience is told not to worry about.
So, his story, shamelessly told by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His is with the lustful, frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and her vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight's face is, say, indistinguishable from Johnny's - especially since faces, like other body parts, are removed from characters with inexorable regularity - is not a problem, and not even a half-problem.
These aren't people, we realize they're archetypes of the noir: the fatal bitch, the overconfident gambler, the honey trap sex detective, the corrupt, stubborn senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and the archetype chases after it, it's not a movie anymore, it's abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
Besides, even in this chaotic world, there is something permanent.
The war whores of the first City still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness besieging their hometown.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is not a ghost, and he'll come to the lighthouse, and Bruce Willis is always a sight to behold.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is something else.
Frank Miller was good at combining comics and noir as a painter, and as a director, he was good at reversing the notion of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposed "realities".
The modern comic book phenomenon began in the late 1920s, when Dashiell Hammett's novels "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of the noir, then called the hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood dozens of heroes, from the spinach-eating sailor Popeye to Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "avengers".
But there was something wrong with any comic book-based movie: The characters were so determined not to grow flesh on screen that they were left to pretend to be in the "real" world around them.
In a nutshell, they were completely deprived of "existence".
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre in world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals, and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsyth, what Tibo and Rugon-Makka, what even Bolkonsky and Rostov are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
This novel quietly mutated into a soap opera, and the crime novel - that is, by definition, the marginal novel - rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned firsthand what it was like to be a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, there were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Loisy, Edward Dmytryk.
So the noir archetype they've set is, first, rude and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost like an American version of social realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable precisely because it was an unnatural but organic combination of comics and noir.
For the first time on screen, the comic came alive, not shying away from its graphic nature, but instead pretending to be a "real" film.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered up for a monstrous sadistic son, was well worth Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details, like the severed heads that the sadist used to decorate his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, author of "Black Orchid" and the best, I mean the most declaratively nauseating, representative of the neon.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation to Miller-Rodriguez's radical style in the face of comic book tradition.
I think a lot of that is because of 3D technology.
When you watch Sin City II, you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside of which the snow is clogging a toy sewer.
Of course, it's not usually snow, it's bloody marks, but what difference does it make?
Well, I'm not talking about socializing.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere in our world, even on the edge of a dirty swamp, there is a normal world where you can take a girl back from a wrong path or, say, tell her bereaved parents that her perpetrator is punished.
But where there is no sin in the city, there is no sin, but law.
Boring as any rule.
Sin City 2's chaos is just boring.
In the name of justice, the domestic lease has given this sweet sin a small but peppery taste.
The subtitles warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
For a show where the most vegetarian episode is a pinch-hitter breaks your fingers, it's a hell of a joke.
Hammett would have loved it.
France's socialists must "shut up and put France in order", says key ally François Hollande
Mr. Vallée called on the deeply divided left to "show warmth" to the attacked socialist president, whose reshuffles have not found approval among the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said, drawing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour workweek despite inflammatory proposals to loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put the cart before the horse by coming to a meeting of dissenters from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marine le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not imagine the new Vallée government would last more than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but a naked Prince Manuel Valls, forced to put together a new government when the old one didn't last the summer.
"And the new one won't last in the fall or winter either", Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win an early election and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came out on top in the EU elections in May.
A poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before Mr Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Sioux Po, warned that the French will quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"No Drug City" is not sued
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court has dismissed the lawsuit filed by the regional ministry's state property management directorate against the drug-free city foundation.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a rent for the building in the center of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region has left without consideration the lawsuit of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) against the "City without Drugs" foundation (one of the founders - the mayor of Ekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7,3 million rubles as a rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which is why the decision was made to refuse to consider the case.
The reason for the absence of the representatives in the Directorate of the State Administration of Information and Information Technology could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The foundation's representatives were also unable to be reached.
We are talking about a mansion that the foundation has occupied in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Sverdlovsk Region's State Property Management Ministry's Disciplinary Directorate filed a lawsuit against the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded that the court recognize the contract of free use of the building-monument as uncompleted.
According to the MIGISO, the agreement did not include any significant conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th arbitration court of Perm, which was satisfied.
The Foundation then appealed the decision to the same court, which was not satisfied, and the Foundation appealed the decision to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, according to which the fund again began to pay rent, the mayor of the city, Yevgeny Roizman, said.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles a month .
The previous county administration gave us this building for free in recognition of our efforts in the war on drugs, as a mark of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided otherwise", he said.
She is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Why was the mayor of Ekaterinburg asked to leave voluntarily ?
On July 24, the deputy of the Ekaterinburg city council, Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city council, Yevgeny Roizman, to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against the arrested suspect in the murder of the pensioner of the deputy of the city hall Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman was found guilty
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "slander" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Ekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where the head of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova made a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roisman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
iPhone will be turned into a wallet .
In the run-up to the September 9th Apple launch, there are a lot of leaks in the press about what to expect from the launch.
Citing sources, the US media reports that the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the Re/code website, at the September 9th product launch, Apple may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will allow the new iPhone 6 to have a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves decline to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to pay at the cash register using your smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to incorporate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows contactless payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the cash register.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that are members of the NFC Forum, an association that promotes the technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC was the Samsung Nexus S, introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, American retailers are still wary of innovation and are not too willing to spend money to equip their stores with such systems.
So now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will eventually force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
France's foreign ministry: Paris' position on Mistral shipments to Russia remains unchanged
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romen Nadal said Paris' position on the Mistral delivery to Russia was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: 'Today the level of sanctions does not hinder the supply.
This is a decision of Europeans, not France", - quotes Mr. Nadal by RIA Novosti.
So the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change of position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

Norwegian Cruise is nearing a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company with a market cap, access to luxury cruise ships and established Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise's shares.
The sources asked not to be named as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative for Apollo declined to comment.

" Crimean " Télécom may receive 250 million rubles in subsidies
The Russian Communications Ministry is proposing to allocate 250 million rubles to the state television and radio company "Krym" in 2014.
As follows from the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, posted on the single portal of disclosure of information on the preparation of regulatory acts, subsidies are planned to be spent "on covering the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
The money will also go to purchase equipment, repair the roof and energy supply systems in the building of the television and radio company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activists disrupt Chinese delegate speech the day after election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday set out a procedure for allowing only two or three candidates to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced pro-democracy activists to re-promise to stop Hong Kong's financial hub with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went out to the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
Lee's briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhang Rongchun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also due to address a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
The Israeli authorities announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
The decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is in retaliation for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year, the BBC reports.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure on Sunday and ordered the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to Gaza sector spokesman Saib Arikat, the international community must hold Israel accountable for "the continuing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands that Kiev start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statism" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with an obvious strategy he has followed since the start of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take back territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to move closer to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently named the occupied territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that recalls the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to respect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to assuage fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to behave differently towards the separatist uprising in the east than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have been discussing at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia's mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections weigh amendments to the constitution that would allow the breakaway regions to have greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whom Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed renewed rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This has led to a large-scale civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steel-making port with 500000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take any specific measures; the leaders called for drafting harsher sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The nude photo scandal has engulfed Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco .
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked went viral in a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 nude photos of The Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of an iCloud leak.
The 101 list is a celebrity name.
Edelstein, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those targeted "feel like they've been invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her lying by the pool with her chest uncovered.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of Chuck Strawhowski and Prohibited Dinner actress Browning, had no comment yesterday about the stolen photos.
Lawrence's spokesperson told TMZ: "This is a blatant invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different than selling stolen goods".
It's just that from a legal standpoint, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal naked celebrity photos .
The massive hacking of the star's accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github that allowed you to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
It uses the same Apple ID login and password as the iCloud cloud from which the photos were stolen.
The script used a method of overriding to learn the password from Find My Phone.
This method involves sequentially entering all sorts of symbol combinations, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script's author claimed that the number of password options entered in Find My Phone is unlimited.
With a proper security system, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user should be notified of the attempted hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users have not received any messages about attempts to retrieve their account password.
The hackers learned the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter post by a Hackapp user, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written with a password-selecting script.
The vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted a Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability is common to many services, but noted that he has no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the "stars" account.
It wasn't me, plz RT
The Prime Minister's Twitter account has once again been hacked
While there is no hard evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service before.
The hackers intercepted the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the cloud security was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Earlier in Russia, the Twitter account of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked.
If the attackers had accessed iCloud in the image above, it could have also been stored the password to the government chief's microblogging account.
The Next Web was unable to get any comments from Apple regarding the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlete
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of Modern Five-Way Fencing to be allowed to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cup stages, won the silver medal of the European championship in the individual competition and became world champion in mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
She's still in the lead this season.
According to the rules, to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to get a special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Lviv-born chess player Ekaterina Lagna, who is a two-time European (2005, 2008), world champion in the flash (2010) and fast chess (2014) events.
In the women 's team of Ukraine , the athlete won the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the team championship of the world in Astana (2013) and the team championship of Europe in Warsaw (2013).
The Central Criminal Investigation has stopped investigating the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has closed the criminal case over the crash of the Tu-204 of the Red Wings airline.
The press service of the department reports.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the boarding engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was the increased speed of approach to landing, failure of the crew to follow standard procedures at landing, as well as the unintentional exit of engines to increased rotations of direct thrust.
The Tu-204 of the Red Wings airline, which was flying Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled off the runway and caught fire.
The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer were killed on the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to a hospital, where they later died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with severe injuries, were undergoing prolonged treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the crash on the Kiev highway, suffered serious injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor's office conducted a search of the Red Wings after the crash, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemeliainenko started training in the SIZO
The famous Russian mixed martial artist Alexander Yemelianenko, 33, who is in detention for allegedly sexually assaulting a domestic worker, has fully recovered from his injuries and started training.
This is reported by "Championship".
In May of this year, the Investigative Committee of Russia charged Alexander Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was placed on the wanted list and was detained in Tambov on May 9 after he was involved in a road traffic accident that resulted in a hip fracture.
Yemelianenko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, and sentenced on September 1.
However, the trial was postponed, and the investigation insisted on extending the detention period until September 30.
If the athlete's guilt is proven, he could face up to six years in prison.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexander Yemeliaenko
His last match was held in January this year, losing to compatriot Dmitry Sosnovsky by technical knockout.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Yemeliaenko.
He is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, four-time world champion and seven-time Russian champion in combat sambo.
Anger is the most universal and functional emotion in the human being.
Angry facial expressions are biologically universal to humankind, and each organ and muscle group involved in making them is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers in Australia and the United States have found.
They reported their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and a brief summary of the findings can be found in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - raised and lowered eyebrows, slanted lips, puffy nostrils - are the same across cultures, even among children who have never seen a face that was born blind, says Aaron Sell, the study's lead author.
In a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that anger is a key emotion for effective conflict resolution.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his terms, which he communicates to the other person through anger.
The researchers found support for another hypothesis: Physically strong people are more likely to be angry and abusive, to feel entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and to prefer violent methods to peaceful conflict resolution.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a "commodity emotion", the researchers decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that produce an angry facial expression should make the angry individual appear more powerful and dangerous to the interlocutor - and thus force them to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled a computer face with each of the seven elements of an angry face, and showed them to informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or a raised chin alone did not make a face look angry, the subjects in the study were unanimous in their opinion that a person with these features was physically stronger.
Man's anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated display of his own power, forcing him to yield and submit.
Man puffs his nostrils and presses his lips together for the same purpose as a frog that puffs itself up or a baboon that shows its fangs.
"Anger is triggered by the refusal of the other person to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of that refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face are arbitrary, they all express the same thing", noted anthropologist John Tobey.
The Ministry of Communications has proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the "Krym" television and radio company
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization "Teleradiocompanies "Crimea"".
This is stated in the draft government resolution prepared by the agency, which was reviewed by "Lenta.ru".
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment".
In particular, the allocated money is intended to re-equip the hardware-studio block, video walls, central hardware and video server room.
It is also planned to acquire a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of fiber-optic communication lines and energy system repairs.
The subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget, provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The state television and radio broadcasting company "Krym" was established in 1959, broadcasting in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television signal of the Telenor covers more than 75 percent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, the "Krim" Teleradiokompaniya received a license to broadcast in digital format.
