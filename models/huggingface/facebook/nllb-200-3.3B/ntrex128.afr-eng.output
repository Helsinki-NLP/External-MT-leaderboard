Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to 'look like fools'
There is consternation among some members of the assembly over the proposal to change their title from AMe to MWPe (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum fear that this may provoke ridicule.
One Labour Party member says his group is concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid Cymru party assembly member says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "responsive" to the name change, but noted that it is a short pun from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which received broad support to name the assembly a "Welsh Parliament".
As for the title of the AM, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
The AMe are apparently working on proposing alternatives, but the battle to reach consensus could be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes in weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the assembly's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an effort to settle a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent because the churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to say, there was a pub and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
"Neither is there today".
He says that the disappearance of pubs is understandable.
"People socialize in other ways these days", he says.
"Pubs are no longer neighborhood family rooms where people go regularly".
As for churches, he worries that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back to exactly where they started".
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people buying units in these buildings will be white", he says, "and therefore will bring even closer the day when these churches close completely, for most of the people moving into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A Black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese was "trying to pass the costs" on to the council, even though the council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old at shrimp diving in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season on Saturday, say officials.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I've been bitten!
I was bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn open", Hammel saw as he reached out to the boy.
"I yelled for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Life Saving Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his torso.
Officials closed beach accesses from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans expansion into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are battling with department store-style beauty aisles staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods decline, the larger beauty aisles will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and if successful will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brand names like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are rub-friendly - something that more and more younger shoppers are insisting on.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Online shopping and a shift to smaller daily quantities of food purchased at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets must do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are becoming more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which they claimed boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how the profits from the pharmacies should be divided within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty salons to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names is designed to meet every need, and the enticing surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'in a rage' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "angrily" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew her from an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their house-clothing-and-accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand name.
The This Morning presenter, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl announced at a tense meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she could no longer devote enough time to their home-wear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune, according to insiders.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and swapped Brittany for one of his vacation homes.
Says one source: "Truly Holly's top priority was by far the most important.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw absolutely stunned all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's top cash-flowing stars, could cost the firm millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility that its launch may be delayed even further.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Harsh Words 'And Then We Fall in Love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his kamma "newsreader" voice.
"I did not give up anything".
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearisation.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership meeting in Singapore, that the North does not see a "coherent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic tone in his rally speech.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea", he said".
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results - it has ended missile tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remains of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there", Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tygon and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite to catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was in force.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure a key campaign focus, spending lavishly on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is beset by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of mounting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with hooked knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks off a good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri conceded for Sturridge when he was about 30 yards out of the Chelsea goal and his side were 1-0 down.
He tacked the ball to the left before he kicked far into the goal post.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right-hand corner of the net.
Finally, the ball bounced over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about trying to get in that position, trying to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked".
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues goalkeeper then hit Mateo Kovacic with a back kick in that area before straying close to midfield and entering the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and conceded in midfield.
Then, with a beautiful forward kick, he led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard overtook the defence and with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the far-away goal net.
Liverpool will take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London, with the match scheduled to start at the end of the day.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people are reported to be trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, causing burns up to 20 feet [6.8 m], agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7.55am in Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that could be vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being told it will take hours before they can be allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said "it's so awful".
At 2 pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers are stationed inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's statute of Cromwell is latest commemorated hit with 'rewriting history' controversy
His exile will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so much of England's cultural and religious artwork carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "silly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The imagery of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe still to be worthy of commemoration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that divide.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Chinese Peasant Slaughtered by a Boar
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a severed, blood-stained artery near a market stall in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened a door to a nearby pig pen.
He said there was a big male pig in the pen with blood on his beak.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My nephew's legs were bloodied and torn", said the nephew, whose surname was Wu, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about five hours later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities allegedly negotiated compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer had a 650- pound pig pinned to his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a 'snapper'.
They're just playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect", he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form and move eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in response to the approaching trough will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause localized rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Flash floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the diffuse nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rainfall can cause deep gorges to affect wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring strong local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to portions of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flows and slippery slopes.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical rainstorms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature variations across the central United States is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, long-term summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm in October, with widely distributed 80°C from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the poignant testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's top-of-the-minute twist: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunkenly molested her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it hard to measure people watching in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as large as one for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion polls strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS Friday morning where protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judiciary Committee.
He stood there for several minutes with his eyes down as CNN viewed him being vilified.
"I am standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told: "You have power while so many women are powerless.
Flake said his office issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered later live hours when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate by one vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of "political games" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is running for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should raise each other's tariffs was "utterly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the scuffle.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office on Friday issued a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "flabbergasted" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wayde said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from Popocatepeti volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano Saturday after activity in the crater increased and recorded 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center has monitored multiple tremors and tremors.
Footage on social media showed thin layers of gas covering motor windscreens in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake ripped through central Mexico in September 2017.
Known as Don Goyo, the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists restrained by riot police showered them with eggs and sprayed powder that created dark clouds of dust in streets usually crowded with tourists.
A riot also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted in unison "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionist shouts of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but turnout was low, with those against dissolution largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes tried to prevent voting from proceeding at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a vital but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in pre-trial detention for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
London: Men arrested after car crashes into home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagardsingel on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at one point.
A goal from the bench gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livigston's promotion astonished Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to the Ibrox club as manager until his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are one win away from the Championship this season and will face the eight-point front-runners Heart next week.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not tasting a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston squanders chances against bot visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round-throatedness bringing Rangers all sorts of trouble.
SR broke through but rolled in front of goal, then AL could only play wide after he approached and CH's head bumped across the goal.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death games.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that point, Rangers had dominated possession but were unable to penetrate the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a turn from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was passed off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow hit wide to evade Livingston's open play.
Overcrosses repeatedly reached and obstructed Livingston's frame, while two penalties  following Halkett's challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball  were ruled out.
 Phenomenal  of Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena, which is the home of the BBC Scotland
Phenomenal play and results for Livingston.
Excellent to the last man; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their playing style and line-up have remained largely unchanged since their return to the top flight, but much credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defensive line while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
The Rangers, however, were short of inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiles and blue skies were in the air as leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was supposed to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a falling out over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters showed up to see their president afterwards.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurdish  also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hailed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Road closures and bus routes are in place, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
Rioting broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Keepers" were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was confined to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may remain behind bars longer.
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison's chief guard was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called to deal with serious disturbances involving staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding
It's unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert, bringing with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach in rain by late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside flash flood danger, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is making landfall across Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Still hurricane-force Rosa, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, at dawn Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore loses its strength.
So it is expected to reach the country Monday afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and present a significant flood risk.
"Rain totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains could cause life - threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the viciousness, the fury" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her allegation during the trial.
The President said Saturday that the Americans saw that day "the brilliance and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a clean record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing", he said.
That is why I am fighting for these candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach party when torches up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, washing many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away and became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it swept away cars, logs, houses, it hit the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved across the open sea at speeds of 500 miles per hour [800 km/ hr] before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant earthquake was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Describing the damage as "considerable", Nugroho said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communication "is completely hampered with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a disaster, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come in at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings of the coming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll is up to 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers were sheltering in deck shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed scenes of destruction en route, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups begin the daunting task of setting up the relief work, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only be started after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet".
As the second night dawns on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer pipe.
Sunday rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaving team, trained two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated on social media among the parachutist community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who were participating in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
"I suppose it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 at an ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was at it, another man "ran up behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye
Announcing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new show Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the program that was canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's producer.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come up with a hyphen and a capital letter.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
In the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students, Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never again use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are drawing youths to gangs.
US to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US has recently formalised an overall AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China announced its plan: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it is the corporate ones", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes could also help bolster the US's AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI", he said.
China's State Council released their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at engaging partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months ago.
Macedonians vote in election on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to the territory and has denied them admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev have argued that it is a price to be paid for seeking admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small parade and moved chairs closer to tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" vote would be "a confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  less than the required number.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum would be the first serious setback to the policies of a pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigating through entire Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a kick at midfield at the start of the series.
He chased through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal.
He then made a pass to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to knock Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball past the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest corner.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the backline.
City take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a spot in the promotion playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still looking to clinch their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I'll face this year.
Why should I not want to be a part of it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly eager to have Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a pitching practice on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rallies in West Virginia
The president has indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All we did was to stake out November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big  I stand, but I actually stand and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for these candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening right now.
And now they are determined to take back power by any means possible, one sees the cruelty, the cunning.
They don't care who hurts them, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them".
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and impede".
"And one sees it over the past four days", he said, and has called the Democrats "mad and mean and sneaky and false".
He referred to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, who received a harsh rebuke from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one. It was really weak body language. The weakest body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Labour MPs to be told that we are not welcome - all because we have said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for her fearless stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that was exactly what Friday night AR meetings were.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "more friendly, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have agreed to otherwise - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a barrage of abuse on social media demanding that I not be re-elected, denouncing politics at the core and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of censure" or change of selection rules, the party is being narrowed.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years encouraging me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken, and then I'll be "okay".
But I did not enter politics to do this.
Since joining the Labour Party as a scholar 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state secondary school in ruins, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading towards a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have, is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political gain will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered by Ayr
Two late thirds may have skewed the final score slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now top of the points table, the only undefeated team in the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "To Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute three, disguised by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot scored an unseeded three.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, just before he, just before halftime, eclipsed a solo three to make it halftime 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, overshadowed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long stoppage for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott which was sustained on a portable, and from the restart Ayr extended the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, eclipsed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the extra player with an unseeded three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very tight game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for catching Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line MacPherson pushed the ball dead behind the upcoming Ayr goal.
Climo missed it, as he also nearly made it from the rebound, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he 's going to take on a new career in the restaurant industry .
Still Game star appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wants to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen to Pacific
Sailors patrol a canvas-covered naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plastered with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to get it back".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is fresh - as is the need to navigate the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on October 1, after 5 years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after decades of sporadic negotiations  Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president  who faces a controversial reelection battle next year  also has much riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court in Bolivia is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia  and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH ruling comes only six months after the last hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than help Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric had drained any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold such talks.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extraordinarily quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country will never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a deadlock, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that continued sanctions and US-led capture of a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang taking meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line of great headgear heading to shops near you
If you want to expand your collection of hats or to avoid the sun altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of loose oversized headgear to their SS19 collection on the catwalk that enchanted the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have paraded their mind-boggling creations on the sidewalk.
Valentino's highlight was a large beige hat with a broad, feathery brim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel- encrusted watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple - but not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks  just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a scuba- gear, with snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to continue the great fashion, this is your lucky day.
Stylists predict that the enormous hats may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats follow closely on the heels of "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide brimmed straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media sent another large creation across the aisle - a straw-beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The branded orange raffich bag, finished with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle on the top, was featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Well-known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores by next summer  as the designer has made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test scores, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of scholars who studied foreign languages obtained an A above.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject, equally prominent as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Occupations and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons workers give for why they struggle to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, learning a second language will be a real asset in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important now to invest in language education for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential for the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still hugely important for the future of the country, and therefore this must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It is necessary to do well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut Sunday for the San Diego Lakers.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies over the next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held for his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November vote comes around.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how does one watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of these excess rallies is to help the Republicans facing a difficult November election.
President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies over the next week aim to "visit volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season", a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be covered by the media in Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time this month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the voting.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show they have the guts for the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided sessions, the four-player teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is a generally accepted sporting concept but one that players wholeheartedly believe in, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were up by six points and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a bit of momentum, I reckon", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more to play for.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the bayou to the clearing, and leads by his example.
That scoring celebration grew harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win game four in a tie, with him and Thomas trailing by two after two rounds.
His sethou, who won the match for them on 15, was greeted with a similar outcry, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all those players have left.
18 holes to stamp them.
The only players to have outscored Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legends.
Europe's unlikely but charming couple have got four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not record one stroke over the course number on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one stroke over the course number on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no player more desirable than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time or at different wells.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short appearances with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
One over the plate and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could barely get out.
Sunday, however, is no one there to help you out of your hole.
The foursomes and foursomes are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has always been better as a team and took a significant lead on the final day, but this four-game series also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight a fight that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming up 10-6 from Saturday's four-ball and four-player matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, overpowered an American team that had been unevenly matched in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they did not let the deficit shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they played together brilliantly to defeat a dad Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has shown flashes of brilliance at times but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-player and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four-ball, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the four-game tie to a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
On a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their way, however.
Jordan Spieth, three-time major champion, and Justin Thomas, set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 3&4 in the four-ball after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point deficit when entering the singles, though Furyk's team only has to tie to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
After two days of second best, however, they are not likely to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it 'definitely will not' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbate their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We are not seeing a corresponding response from the US, however", he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for taking gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not unconditionally reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is insisting on the 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and exerting more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a forceful way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust".
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader drew attention to at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in during the past five months, adding: "If the party in this issue of destruction of nuclear weapons had been South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
The tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would be directed at the US landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "fire-man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavishly praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea eliminates nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's enforcement of sanctions must continue vigorously and without pause until we realize the full, final, verified destruction of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "disrespectful demands" just hours later.
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "conforming measures".
He said Kim told him that the "matching measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is allowing all undergraduates to get more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-driven "night sessions".
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general well- being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course includes some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressures on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" in avoiding stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding them to gain weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leaving you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after walking one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeated Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another heartbreaking day when Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's inconsistent side a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox side were looking to claim their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side conceded to Gerrard only his second knockout in 18 matches as manager so that his side were eight points behind Hearts, who were leading the Ladbrokes in the Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and it did not seem that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
With Rangers now falling to sixth, Livingston climbed to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And further trouble may lie ahead for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the side of the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and would have been in his pants with the way his well-trained team smashed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to score after just two minutes when Menga's first interception sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss at the back post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if there was more hope than conviction about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots on target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hampered by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only for their hard work.
Rangers once again failed to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the trade had an almost immediate impact as the winger sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett taking long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide off the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and TODAY . . . the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a mainstay of science, and it has also become a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", which starred those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Gee, it's about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer drug can teach the immune system to 'see' predatory cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predatory cells
As part of treatment, vaccine teaches immune system to identify rogue cells
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it back
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began making pro-Trump comments after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance in which he credited US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, he lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people all the time and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star poked fun at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's banter was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that he was made difficult behind the scenes by what he wore on his head.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments drew cheers from the audience on at least two occasions and members of the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhythm guitarist Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING BY THE SQUARES".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") someone who I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We did too", she added.
Before the show, the rhyming jester announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being who used to be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rhyme-chatter, Snoop Dogg, went by the name Snoop Lion and of course late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder over stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has criticized toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often mean that young boys feel they must be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture saying he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What did we men learn growing up about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its overly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because something has obviously gone wrong with our young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any of the Game of Thrones prequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thug.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staffer leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday lashed out at allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were being driven by "far-right" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more abhorrent lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised by this fraudulent and false allegation - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie ".
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a sign of anger", Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not become angry.
He should not be defiant.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and quiet".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to lift Waters out of the midterm, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the plegers are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for anything they do that is destructive and dangerous to any member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - weak Rowan Atkinson spy crafting
It is now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British twist, and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the clumsy Johnny English with his ragged and rubber face has had his license to mess around renewed for a second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the derided secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to sophisticated elegance, has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international man of riddles, who leaves chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard commercials.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who ran into a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armour and briefly cut the screw blades on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is demonstrated but the humour feels rather bland and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient themselves.
The humor feels more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me, Johnny English's misfortune is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes in the persona of Bean.
The ever-present thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercriminal infiltrated Britain's top-secret network of spies and revealed the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for a prime minister who is a puffed-up and embarrassed character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is very little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she must recall someone from retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some decent institution, but who, off the record, gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a role all too much to expect from Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to throw everything away in Her Majesty's Secret Service and they come across Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite like children's TV.
Rather mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brought out his talent?
Labour denies that it devised a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but get paid for five days.
The party claims that it wants company-wide savings brought about by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on to workers by giving them an extra day.
This will leave workers with a three - week pay cut - but they will still take home the same pay.
Sources say it will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in the workers' favor.
The change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to weigh in on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "faceless directors" and "profit-makers" in service companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make 'withdrawals' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 per cent of equity in private sector companies to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, decisive, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I've formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will take an indictment of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been in a diligent denial", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all that she mentions could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is World Citizenship Day, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of performing stars and an equally impressive goal: the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different causes.
It says that these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that have resulted from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourselves, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
answered World Citizen: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy for "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports - interior minister
"If necessary", Washington can rely on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, southern Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to one official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to blockade, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are virtually the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel", he said while referring to Russia as a "genius" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest level of sport", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6 I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren voiced her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for possible running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the woundedness of our returning soldiers", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room", and of her son and other veterans, she said, "they come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military gave to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court subpoena in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy in August was not made public.
She says her husband "and his violent gang members", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing deep-seated gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants without the necessary documentation who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy", the friend-of-the-court legal brief said.
Lawyers further argued in the legal brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June instructed immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her febrile baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for flooded possessions, trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outside for ongoing severe concussions.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the rubble of the walls, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to their equalizing tariff surcharges on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and no true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrisome economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined the offer to publish his article", though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
As numerous top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defending him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions are running high, and most Republicans are on record already indicating that they want to continue the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's call for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is on its way!" as they demonstrated in the entrance lobby of the Senate as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among swing-stem female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't vote often because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the details of her sexual assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more taking the latter's side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her when he was 17 years old while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a start-up that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the project.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and applicable skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about launching a complete change or not, where all their business models are completely overturned overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a Medium post published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am tremendously optimistic about this next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross spiritual celebration of the French
The only Church of England cleric to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone is being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he man - alone stormed a field gun and knocked out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's action is "something I know I could never do, but something that is encouraging".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels honoured to be able to play a part in the parade", adding that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a crowd of people".
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 but get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, only to miss the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main program which would be broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to take the fight to each other, UK viewers were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying up until the early hours especially for the battle.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke".
"It's government regulation that the 6pm content was not appropriate and that's why they had to switch to kids' shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", yeah.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rerun, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six fights like we normally do and we've tried to offer more for our fans and just go over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt 'inferior' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with "a sense of inferiority about his sexuality" but that it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he went to high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he lied about his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular presenter of the long-time program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as a reject on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and energy to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter, and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has been able to express his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "caught him off guard".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age"  He went to his first Olympic Games at 14 and his father died three years later from cancer  He said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says her "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games - there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson not on the board and pulling out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his form back in order to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being team leader and working on his game on the practice bench in the hope of fixing what is wrong.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most straightforward rider and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long grass always punishes the wandering punters.
And as if the course itself wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles matches well, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he'll be fine tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Heroes and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play two games.
I had more in mind, but this is how things turned out and this is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the heights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence added intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a lot of sense, he likes to joke, and he's a great guy to have in the locker room", he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed playing with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just play".
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great lead may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Deen made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but won only nail-bitingly by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won by a landslide", said Bjorn, pictured after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our squad, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world".
Excited about how his players fared on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never rush things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that is to come, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a buddy when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you should be passing on to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to make the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will want his players to do better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of that great last-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up the loser as Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word of it", he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle matches.
We organized our team accordingly and assigned the men who we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counter attack and came into the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the table.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German military's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the tormenting post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle-order air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships  that will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas  will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors  just half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, which reduces performance and reduces the Fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project - including the crew's training - also became an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - more than the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "deployable ships are running out".
The official said that the issue has worsened over time, as old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Fleet.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a Scottish Highland estate that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and superior damselfly as well as the brown langour and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat flocks and determine which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as grassland creation and how best to manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting activities make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo - orientation technique to identify bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [16 km 2] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleep inspections and occasionally perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the need to search for bats before doing maintenance in properties because it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nest may mean the death of up to 400 females and young and may wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or interdict them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo settles rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are poised to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers, released hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to take a look at this.
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "intolerable reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages of any amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who had been let down by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisal" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved to Italian giants Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'forever regret' if it loses its car manufacturers
The UK will "return it forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not just to enjoy the success that we have now, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs could reduce the plant's competitiveness in the long run and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convener at the plant, says that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "A date has not been set yet, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed for another week with all the other stuff going on with the supreme court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who are "effect-oriented", though she said, "I will not argue with the fact that they are effect-oriented".
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is having more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers".
Briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and you've seen us do this a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a bizarre, unruly and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish they would stay on after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processing status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and kind of just packed in there", said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type/ extent of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
Stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on individuals and firms not paying UK tax, with the extra money helping the government's plans to tackle homelessness.
The additional tax  in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased to rent  can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move could bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by raising land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing crisis".
Mr Corbyn has announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault evictions".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right that it is just as easy for individuals not living in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness an all too real reality.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the bouncers.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the second team, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I often watched Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child and that is something that pulls me back.
The opportunity, however, can only come if I am successful in running a club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. Ross was also the first manager of Sunderland to be appointed to the post.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety about emulating such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, success for me will be measured by 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out again".
Ross's managerial career is just three years old, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then played for Alloa helping them return from relegation to the third league and convert St Mirren from being on the brink of relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he says as he looks back on his takeover of Alloa's reins.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a decent living out of it and experienced decent highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that one should come to weekly.
I'm still going through it with respect to the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive, and now that I do, it's the most comfortable feeling I've had in my own skin all my adult life".

The perfect time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7% in July, but restaurant receipts were down 4.8%, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected attendance at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking establishments were up 2.8 percent, with restaurants hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened only in July.
Drink-driven bars and pubs fared better, rising more than restaurants declined.
Food-guided drinking venues also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across-run pubs and drinking establishments, sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food washing up 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to out-of-home sales.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year over year will be particularly difficult on top of ongoing cost-cutting pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief.
Total sales growth across bars and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, pub and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret social-media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head account" to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "clean" "head account" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to rape her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot track them".
Eilidh Doyle will be voting for athletes on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as "a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade".
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC pundit, unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was grueling work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows shares opinions online
A breast pump company has divided opinions online with an ad comparing breast- feeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are weaning.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics such as "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not onions, it's my breasts".
The chorus part is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk the ladies".
But the ad, published on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it undermines the "gimmicks" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Because we have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen within days of giving birth", wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another observed: "Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "The ad is so out of touch".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screamily awful" to her.
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had one if I had continued breast-feeding.
Milking out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it is.
It is a product of genius", wrote one.
Another observed: "It's a fun ad targeted at mothers who are milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feeling like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are weaned say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding trough that allows women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are breast- feeding.
Ana Balarin, Partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the process of weaning and all its challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and human-connected way the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to remain in the country would be jeopardized by coming forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to pursue those individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to expedite the processing of the children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good-bye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even as the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be "handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, was "almost over".
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy fight until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away".
We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of indictment and scandal ends his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of any presidency ever!
To date, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather fly jacket (a garment thick with hubris, The Washington Post said), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never watch Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is he feeds you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's shifting cast and daily plot twists (such as seeking to quarrel with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
One cannot afford to miss one episode, or one will be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember back then we were doing all these crazy programs and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Outside rally to the most exciting midterm races in the House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has now landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
The newly transformed suburban Pittsburg district is being contested by Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb  who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republican's favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners took over the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", the department's spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, fines were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in US aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid- September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to proceed to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the gathering for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying history
The next thing that could happen is the special counsel's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also believed to be focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our election.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
That's a lot of axes, and I don't mean to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
Decisions are being made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the extent of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years that followed.
The course of history turns on such turning points, and democracy's relentless march is hastened or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated about his eligibility for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we follow those tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table that carries the swastika.
With that as my background, how can I not be n optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play hosts Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel-good factor to the place.
The group is good and the men are really enjoying themselves; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we can push through now, put last season behind us and be successful".
Women lose sleep over this retirement scare
Despite survey respondents having a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own capabilities as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut out legal lines at the pass.
Have a health care proxy in place so that you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals honor your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also having a power of attorney for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to pay them.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at issue, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place".
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with a windgun
A man was shot several times with a sawed-off shotgun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "unusual act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications disabled, emergency officials were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December resulted in a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 metres (33 ft) that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, leading to destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not lead to a tsunami, but over 100 people died from collapsed buildings,
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is being held on $500 uninsured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, definitely" when asked what he pleads, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to five years and fined $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now before Alaska's Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been knocked out of service with fatality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to harass pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "thorough planning and premeditation", said prosecutors, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "horrible, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the notice of intent stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a capital case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told detectives that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MPs say Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK "would be out" by the time Mr Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to unite her deeply divided officers was raised by pro-Romein Tories by joining a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she would push through in her bid to reach a deal with Brussels despite the impasse and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Walk Mean Walk convention in Solihull that he wanted to "sweep out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have been out by then,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.'
Outlining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we get elected in the first place.
Let Chequers please go and begin listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers should keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farge said that the assembly politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the verge of overturning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the heat of our political class, who are about to betray Brexit.
 We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom. 
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the city center.
A few activists waved Tory Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Party Lord Adonis ridiculed the Tories for the security issues they endured with a party app as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a common trick.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to look hard to run for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to run for president" following the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculating that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump has been in office.
A bystander asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the very top".
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, was in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and maintained averages of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinches world title after team orders give him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would play a big part in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and nearly won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, leaving Hamilton to drive in the traffic at the very back of the pack, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes putted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward to wheel-on-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver tearfully risk-free the inside to leave at risk of being outstripped after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the road course grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish fast and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually got into the pits on the 44th lap, but could not pick up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastically all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job to have a one-two", said Hamilton.
It was a terrible body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday at a rally mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has gone on in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars", he said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer -- did you leak the document -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not that.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
"We have leaked it... No, we have not leaked it", he added, in a speech to the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter setting out the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked".
But the president did not appreciate her denial, commenting during the Saturday evening assembly: "I tell you what, that was some bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the injustice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to get power and control", Mediaite reported the president as saying.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the team finished with a record of 5-2
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match against them 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead on pitches from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals sealed their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who had lost games at first and then won on Friday night Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the catalyst for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead into the first break when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was badly shaken at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks our hearts to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster reporting agency saying that access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be rising as many bodies are still under the rubble while many are still unreachable", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to 20 feet [6 m] swept away Palu, who will be given a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing in bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The miniarchy is being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready? reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after beach lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man is missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they have not been able to account for a male passenger.
The airline said that it is working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
"This is a particularly good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendant panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the improvement of a dock also helped with an inflatable lifeboat to get people to and from land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airliners in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts are laying out a timeline of the night that woman was burned alive.
The state closed its case Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that her cell phone was at Chambers's during the time he said he was at his friend Michael Sanford's, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was joking, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by infusing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Just another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple for being fired after 'racist' text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "just another black person".
The couple deny being racist and liken the case to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, laughed at her shock when she learned that the new childcare worker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO BLACK PERSON", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a note.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After she discovered her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that their outgoing African-American nanny had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for her one-day work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for damages over the firing and is seeking damages in the amount of $350 a day for the six months, in-house work she was initially hired for, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that well", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back against the allegations that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to terminate Maurice's employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people", man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Go on now".
Plasco likened the matter to 'extortion' and said that his wife was two months from having a baby and was in a 'very difficult situation.'"
"Are you going to chase after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do", added the investment banker.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to take the couple on social media and to hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it's published.
It is very amusing to hear of Paddington's great success".
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitterly sad".
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a rather quiet man and he was not a very apple-eating person", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success kind of that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called frequently to say that it was very bad, that they did not expect her to make it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die in the next two minutes and that I should say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors had given her to keep her heart beating was slowly running out of her system.
She died a short time ago and the body was being dismantled.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it would unfold.
I could not dance or shout or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she had endured.
"Nobody knew", she said.
"I had my head in a bag and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I developed an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge for some time with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile brightened any room".
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I worry constantly that there's going to be a domino effect".
Ms. Davis designed the cards "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling sick or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact or anything with them".
She said that his death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It tore a hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we must all go on and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that has no scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have the FBI investigate?
Their opposition is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush calls senators to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector numbers daal under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet and said there were 1,127 transfers last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly-protective Demilitarized Zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
It came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they broadly agreed to work together for the denuclearized Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first, Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unqualified to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'hysterical,' " Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times had almost screamed and choked as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly disapproved of Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court that he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative law.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of rage boiling over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she just walked in.
And I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are permissible as a partial exit from the tooth because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my keenest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is of one time finding myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an older woman - a cold manager whom I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a stairway.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy, because they have had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had to drop out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think about the decision very well", she told me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraising and so she made a vow that she would not enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only $250 would be returned to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she choked.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalls of the way the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and while the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods every time, recently slapping tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of American goods.
China has vowed to match the US in size and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to demands, but publicly complying with US demands would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over US trade war could positively support China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic meltdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously admitted, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said that conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flattened country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe's Ryder Cup win in Paris is in its own hands
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-shirt into the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was 5&4 blown out by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has a 2 and 1 chance to land Poulter of England who may have played in his Ryder Cup final.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the green with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
It was time this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We scrapped.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You should keep your hat on a slant.
We are outnumbered.
Latest on Red Ridge: Concentrations decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red-eyed concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, colorful bloom conditions are being reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier cities - suggesting reduced concentrations.
In full bloom, the Red-breasted Mermaid stretches about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee towns.
Kolle can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough town, but in fewer locations compared to last week.
Red-eared sliders have also been observed in Pasco City.
Medium concentrations in or near the coast of Pinellas City were reported in the past week, low to high concentrations near the coast of Hillsborough City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Manatee City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Sarasota City, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Lee City, and low concentrations in Collier City.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the cities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
