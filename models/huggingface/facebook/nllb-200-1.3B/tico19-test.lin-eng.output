how long have these symptoms lasted?
And all chest pain should be treated to survive this way for your age
and with fever
and your cholesterol should be checked
and you have a fever now?
and you have chest pain now?
and you have difficulty breathing
And can you tell me any other symptoms you have with this?
and how high your fever was
and I have cough again
and I'm a little cold with a cough
and now I have a terrible chest pain
And this time it's time to pick your hay fever
and it's on the chest
and I think I have a little fever
and I want you to explain to me where the chest pain is
and have a low fever and
and your diabetes story
And you know it's doing the trick My chest will break
and woe to the people who are spitting all over me
and you have chest pain
and you say what is heavy on your chest
family member has heart disease, cardiac arrest, high blood pressure
have you noticed any other symptoms or complications with the pain in the joints?
Are there other people in your household who have the same symptoms as you?
do you have any other symptoms?
your breathing?
you still have chest pain
because this is the time of the flu
and should not be placed on the side of heart disease that causes chest pain
but the most serious problem now is chest pain
but with breathing pain
but i know many people will serve me
But we must look at the painful situation with great pain
But now you can breathe well like this?
the cause of chest pain in its entirety
act like someone is going to pinch you in your chest
It's like a short breath
Are they suffering from the same symptoms?
do you have any other chronic condition like high blood pressure or something like that?
do you have any other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes?
Do you have a bad breath with that chest pain?
do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have a short break with that?
what symptoms did he have?
Do you see the shadow ?
drink plenty of water today
But instead help the test for diabetes
But the symptoms are similar
How high is your fever?
How is your blood pressure?
if you continue to have a fever
if you have a fever of 2 degrees or higher
if you think your symptoms are becoming more serious, ask for a thorough examination
I had a fever yesterday
I have a low fever again
I had a fever yesterday
I have a sharp pain in my chest
I am in pain and I choose to rest
by sending you a shadow
I have a chest pain today
I heard someone have a fever today
I think it's the flu
I think it's a little bit of a flu.
Do you feel like a big man sitting on your chest?
It all started with the pain and the fever at the same time
inner chest and
compression like chest pain
it's in the chest
the middle of the chest
in the middle of the chest
I have a pain in my chest
I'm afraid of this chest pain
I want you to tell me the meaning of this chest pain
high blood pressure or diabetes
as a slit in the chest
Now choose fever and drink tachipirin sweet
Now mary how long have you been feeling these symptoms
Now you say you have chest pain
sometimes I have chest pain
I see, then you will feel other symptoms along with chest pain
or someone who sits on your chest?
It is the same as a person with a stroke, fever, cough, and muscle pain
just in the middle of the chest
show me in this shadow where you will suffer
if you have a fever
So you think some of the minor symptoms might be due to your pregnancy?
So do your children have minor symptoms like this?
tell me about your chest pain
Fever increases at night
fever I had two days ago
The fever started to rise last night
I'm here to pick up the porter at the triage of the emergency center.
Well, can you tell me how much pain you have in your chest?
they, I have some pain in front of the body and here I am through the chest and
I feel a sharp pain in my chest
they, when I have this pain in my chest
what kind of pain do you have in your chest?
when did this chest pain start?
where do you feel the pain in your chest?
where do you feel that chest pain
you feel like your chest is closed
you know i have diabetes and other things
you said you'd feel that chest pain
The number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) will increase rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
If the overall coronavirus (COVID-19) infection rates are similar across the EU/EEA and the UK, this suggests that, despite the country-specific variation, the COVID-19 infection is likely to spread rapidly in all countries.
In light of the situation in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to be prepared to accommodate the large number of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment, especially in intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of an unknown respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the outbreak was caused by a new strain of coronavirus now known as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has since been referred to as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Current evidence suggests that 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms, such as respiratory complications or respiratory distress, and most will recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is caused by severe illness requiring hospitalization, and 6% by severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations is 4%.
In this study, we will look at the overall COVID-19 outcome in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to that of Hubei Province, China.
We will also compare the current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK to those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Union/EEA and the UK
As in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries and the COVID-19 outbreak will spread to other countries in the same way as it did in China.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first European cases of COVID-19 according to WHO data.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020; they were people who had returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, there were COVID-19 cases in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), and as of 31 December 2019, there have been 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths from the disease, with Italy alone having 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Identify all cases and persons with COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the country-specific COVID-19 case numbers, which are only available from official sources such as the international health ministries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, daily at 08:00 a.m.
The data was used to estimate the spread of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and compared with Italy.
In terms of the actual COVID-19 cases, we consider the 14-day high for COVID-19 cases, so we look at the COVID-19 prevalence in each EU/EEA country and the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the total number of cases per country as of 15 March 2020 at 08:00 am, compared to the number of cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
The 14-day COVID-19 transmission schedule in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom will follow the pattern in Hubei Province (China) (Number 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, COVID-19 infections started to peak around 21 February and then peaked around 28 February 2020 (More information).
It was mainly based on the high incidence of the disease in Italy, but in all EU/EEA countries the number of COVID-19 cases was also rising at a similar rate (Alternative data).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 8AM on 15 March, 15 other European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had the same number of cases as Italy just 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases will increase significantly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The data from all COVID-19 cases suggest that the pandemic will spread equally in other countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have different standards, medical professionals will provide different services, and there may be different definitions of disease in different countries and different laws for selecting patients to test for COVID-19, including subsequent testing.
In early March 2020, Italian health authorities in the affected areas reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reports said that intensive care units in these regions were overcrowded.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and/or intensive care units are currently available in the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of the population, respectively (data not shown).
However, they must be carefully combined to add to the latest data on the number of cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant improvement in intensive care and inpatient beds in central Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less capacity than Italy (12.5 intensive care units and medium-sized beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010).11
Patient care provision is overwhelmingly out of reach, with the estimated EU/EEA and UK hospital admissions for COVID-19 and a &gt; 90% risk of bedlessness in intensive care provided by the sixth ECDC Emergency COVID-19 Risk Assessment Report.
Because cases are concentrated in other parts of the European/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and intensive care hospitals are often used to house people from a specific region, information on cases and intensive care beds should be available in the Nomenclature of Information Level 2 (NUTS-2).
The developments in Italy and the ongoing developments in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to spread rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to respond to the increased prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the increased number of COVID-19 cases requiring treatment, particularly in intensive care, such as those in the Italian provinces where the disease is present.
As highlighted in the recent emergency risk assessment conducted by ECDC, a rapid, efficient and effective approach is essential to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, by focusing on the infection and reducing the cost of contamination; as predicting how many people will actually become infected does not help decision makers and hospitals will not have the time to understand, accept and respond to it without testing it first.
The early warning also addresses the public health measures to slow the spread of the epidemic.
There is little opportunity at this time for countries to increase control of efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to put pressure on healthcare.
If not, the health systems of some European/EEA countries will have more patients and require intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, making it a serious public health crisis.
In relation to its cousin virus, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats and have similar symptoms and infectious pathways.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less lethal than SARS but is more transmissible and affects older adults more than younger adults and more men than women.
As the literature on the disease continues to expand, the purpose of this article is to provide timely information and to highlight the research activities that will be carried out in this area.
We will discuss important aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this article will help you understand and treat this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable event for all Chinese, as they were told to stay indoors for the entire festival and for several weeks after due to the outbreak of a new pandemic.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that was the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 people recovering and discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "humanity's number one enemy" and may be more deadly than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, women have published more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on the viral transmission was released on January 7, 2020.
This article will attempt to summarize the research that will be done on this new and rapidly spreading phenomenon.
Where possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by the Middle East respiratory virus (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned about the fight against and prognosis for this disease and other important questions.
CoVs are considered to be a relatively minor cause of death, affecting approximately 15% of the population 4.
However, in this century, we have seen two highly pathogenic CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were introduced from China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and spread rapidly to other countries with high infection rates and high mortality rates.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV to emerge in human history.
As indicated in Figure 1.1, a respiratory illness of unknown origin was first reported in Wuhan on 31 February 2019 by the Chinese National Health Service.
Seven days later, the origins of the CoV were revealed.
On 15 January 2020 the first case was reported in Wuhan.
At that time, the disease spread rapidly from town to town, from province to province, and from country to country.
On the 20th, the diagnosis was announced, indicating that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was shut down and public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first case study was started, and of the 41 cases, only 21 were reported in the Wuhan seafood market where the outbreak was caused by an unidentified animal.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the disease a global pandemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
How quickly, how far, and how strong the effects will be is still unknown.
As of 11 February 2020, a study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 actual COVID-19 cases has revealed the latest information on the pandemic as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but most commonly people aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years of age, the lowest were under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 was more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in communities mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to detection.
The average duration of the disease before detection is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The reproduction rate (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 change was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases rose pre-January 23, 2020, coinciding with the peak transportation during the Chinese Spring Festival.
Mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the change in mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and respiratory distress.
CoVs are part of a larger family of viruses and are among the most commonly associated with RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, whereas alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The (S) glycoprotein binds to its angiotensin receptors and reacts with the enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane binds.
Viral RNA is produced in the cytoplasm; after viral replication, the viral RNA enters the glycoprotein envelope and the nucleocapsid proteins form a virion-containing vesicle, which binds to the plasma to produce the virus.
The first genome of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with 99.98% identifiability in blood from 10 samples collected at the site of the initial outbreak, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV but not to MERS-CoV.
By means of electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are detected in the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is less strongly bound to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause human infection as severely as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also produce a new orf3b-derived protein and release a protein derived from orf8.
The orf3b strain of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the emergence of the virus and exhibit IFNβ-like symptoms; however, orf8 has no known function or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cryo-EM body of a very tall human ACE2 with a 2.9 Å complex was found to contain the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that these complexes, which were open and closed, were linked together and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the detection of CoV and the disease.
B0AT1 may become a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Origin and second home
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet and camels.
Comparing between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bats were the most likely human carriers of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to the two bat-derived SARS-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 CoVs.
However, what caused the virus to move from animals to humans is still unknown, and how it got there is still unknown.
Ji and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, and that it was incorporated into the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - the mammals commonly used as pesticides in China - are probably the second most common host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% homologous blood samples of the CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two viruses is still a big difference; therefore, we will continue to wait for the definitive conclusion (Num.
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive outside the environment for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at below 20 °C and 40%-50% in a cool environment.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; or, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, perasetic acid, chloroform, and other antibiotics, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively kill the virus.
All humans are immune to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore the new virus is highly contagious.
At present, there is no comprehensive study on the efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Mot. (Mot.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a target, the immune system identifies it by means of a series of prerequisite recognition (PRRs) including its C-type vector, Toll-like vector (TLR), NOD-like vector (NLR), and RIG-like vector (RLR).
Using a variety of pathways, the virus causes inflammation, enlarges the dental wall, and shortens interferon-like I (IFNs) that block the virus from spreading and stimulate the release of viral inhibitors.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to avoid the effects of the immune system.
Recently, the virus's antibodies have been combining to fight it.
T cells including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a major role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies, and CD8+ T cells kill the infected cells immediately.
The helper T cells release cytokines that activate the immune system.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function in the dead T cell model.
Combined antibodies such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in the fight against the virus.
For example, antibodies removed from survivors killed MERS-CoV.
However, an overreaction of the immune system can produce excessive amounts of radicals in the body and can damage the lungs and other organs, and worse, cause multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is initially contagious, is more common in elderly patients with other conditions and pregnant women.
People who have been exposed to a lot of viruses or whose immune systems have been compromised are often at a higher risk of contracting the disease than others.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a peak of 3-7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people found that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, found that the duration of the disease was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) in 8,866 subjects.
It is important for clinicians to adjust the quarantine period to the actual time of the disease onset, which will prevent people with symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As is usually the case, people who have been in contact with or have been infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Does the quarantine period have to be 24 days?
Fever is often the most important and early symptom of COVID-19, which can occur by itself or with other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, wheezing, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience pain and/or shortness of breath for up to a week after onset of illness.
In severe cases, patients developed early respiratory distress, heart palpitations, acid reflux, and blood clotting.
People with fever and/or respiratory distress and severe fever, even if suspected of having lung problems, should be tested for the disease.
A small population study conducted in late December 2019 found that the symptoms were 98% fever, 76% cough, 55% dizziness, and 3% diarrhea; 8% of the population needed ventilation.
Similar results were obtained in two recent studies of pathogens and viruses in non-infected people.
However, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV patients and the majority had fever (98%), severe cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) among the most severe symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation, more so than COVID-19 patients and the death toll from MERS but similar to COVID-19.
Dizziness (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), severe cough (29%-75%), dizziness (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were found to be the most severe symptoms and approximately 14%-20% of patients required ventilation.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% as the global death toll reached 66,576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 cases.
As for MERS, according to a census conducted in June 2012, the death rate was 37 percent of the 2,494 cases.
The initial study indicated that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are shown in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The packages usually come from the same family or place or come as a boat.
Patients are usually people who have traveled to or lived in or other areas where the disease has spread or been contacted by humans within two weeks of the onset.
However, it appears that people who have not had symptoms for more than two weeks may be infected with the virus and survivors who have been discharged from the hospital may be re-infected, so the quarantine period should be extended.
Patients with normal or low white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) at the very beginning of the disease.
For example, lymphopenia in the white blood cell count 4×109/L with lymphocyte count 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated liver and vascular enzyme and myoglobin levels, and many patients had elevated C-proteins and erythrocytes.
In patients with severe disease, the level of dimer D, a weakening of the blood vessels, rises, and the lymphocyte count gradually decreases.
Chest pain has been observed in many COVID-19 patients and has shown varying degrees of dark patches or dark areas in the lungs.
Patients often had respiratory illnesses, severe lung injuries, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, severe pain, hypertension, and fibrosis can cause difficulty in breathing.
The malfunction of type I and II pneumocytes lowers the level of surfactant and increases the pain, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to open and increasing the risk of lung rupture.
Thus, severe lung disease was often associated with severe pain.
On 18 February 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte damage, hyaline secretions, and intracytoplasmic lymphocyte rupture, and cell-cell damage in the lungs of patients who died of the disease; it is consistent with the pathology of the virus and ARDS and is similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reaction-to-reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as a key indicator for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of falsification, which could exacerbate the epidemic, the use of diagnostic diagnostic tests (not limited to RT-PCR) was introduced in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar process was used to detect SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, outcome, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings is important and will help to make a more robust diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a technique using the CRISPR SHERLOCK SARS-CoV-2 detection method, to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L or 200 × 10-18 mol/L (numbers 10-100 per microliter) using a gauge in less than an hour without any complicated procedures.
Hopefully, this new technique can dramatically change the sensitivity and efficacy of treatment, if it is accepted after careful consideration.
Because of the lack of knowledge about the new CoV, clinicians may only be able to treat COVID-19 patients to a limited extent, while waiting for the majority of treatments that women have used or previously considered to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
These include novel and potential medicines that include herbal remedies, immunosuppressants, steroids, human plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and medical treatments.
They even claimed that plasma from the patient could be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies will work hard to develop a vaccine and a vaccine against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the early stages and may have moderate attacks on other ACE2-containing organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory distress and dementia are the most serious risks to many patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory therapy is essential to alleviate symptoms and to cure disease and includes the administration of oxygen as a treatment, oxygenation, non-invasive oxygenation, and inhalation of oxygen depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress were treated with an oxygen-injected periodon (ECMO), a new cardiac implantation technique used to treat severe heart attacks or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and curing secondary and acute infections, and protecting living organs are important for people with SARS-CoV-2 infections.
It is known that elevated cytokine and immune response are associated with SARS and MERS.
Cytokines are a class of cytokines produced by several cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
Cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a variety of different radicals that often cause ARDS and organ damage.
Immunosuppressants are essential for the release of cytokines, especially in patients with severe illness.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antibody, were used to treat cytokines.
Other cytokine immunosuppressant therapies include immunosuppressant T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine-dependent 4 inhibitor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used as a treatment for SARS to reduce the effects of the disease.
However, high-dose steroids were not relevant for lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, it can lead to other complications, especially in the blood cells, and can seriously impair prognosis.
However, low doses of corticosteroids have been recommended for use in patients with severe COVID-19 infections.
At the time of writing, there is no known cure for the virus.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be more effective in treating COVID-19 patients in the United States.
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that was originally developed at Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg cases.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential for other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
In light of these findings, Gilead has sent the devices to China for testing on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are awaited.
In addition, baricitinbe, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been reported to be effective in treating acute respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, vomiting, vomiting, liver failure, and other adverse reactions may occur when this medication is combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Combination with other medications used for other patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from survivors and immune systems
The practice of collecting blood from survivors of a pandemic to treat others with the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection has a long history.
Indeed, survivors often have strong antibodies in their blood to fight off the virus.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against bacteria and other pathogens and to identify and then kill pathogenic molecules.
Based on these data, plasma is usually taken from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and is then divided into 10 patients who are severely ill.
They felt better after 24 hours; the pain from the virus was gone and oxygen levels in the blood had been reduced.
However, verification and clarification are essential to suggesting the use of this method to be used before a real cure is developed.
In addition, because of the potential for harm, other risks of plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune system and can trigger the production of cytokines, which are highly toxic.
Antibody-blood binding is generally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies to fight a major pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and appropriate to isolate B cells from survivors and determine the potency of these antibodies or to transfer them to determine whether these antibodies can fight the virus proteins.
This, in turn, will enable us to produce antibodies more quickly.
TCM has been used to treat a wide range of ailments in China for centuries.
However, the risks are due to the fact that the combination of many different substances is different depending on the disease and the TCM's approach.
Many useful substances are still unknown or poorly understood because of the difficulty of producing and verifying these substances and the difficulty of synthesizing them.
Now, due to the lack of a robust and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the preferred treatments for people with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from a serious illness.
For example, the capsule drug Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be highly effective in curing COVID-19.
The highest survival rates from COVID-19 vaccination were observed in most Chinese provinces where TCM was used with 87% of patients, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), but in Hubei Province, where TCM was used with only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, only one survival rate was reported (13%).
However, this comparison is difficult because other factors such as the number of cases and the severity of the disease must be taken into account as well.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) itself with Western medicine and TCM.
They found that the time needed for the body to cool down, to get rid of symptoms, and to be in the hospital was less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
What is more surprising is that the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM alone group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality was lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM alone group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM are yet to be confirmed by large-scale clinical trials.
It also draws attention to the process and explanation of the strength of the components of TCM medicines or their combination where possible.
People who suspect or who have been infected with COVID-19 are often more fearful of a deadly disease, and those who are quarantined are more likely to be anxious, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, lack of oxygen, and coughing and other medical problems such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
During the initial outbreak of SARS, these patients were reported to have exhibited a variety of symptoms, including severe depression, anxiety, seizures, irritable bowel syndrome, memory loss, dementia, and even attempted suicide.
Tracking contacts and quarantining people to protect them from COVID-19 can lead to increased stress and guilt for transmitting disease, quarantining, and causing pain to family and friends.
Therefore, they should provide individual health care to people with COVID-19, those suspected of having it, and anyone else who needs it.
Human services should focus on the selection of multi-person team to provide patient care, regular and open communication and up-to-date information on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatments, together with the development and implementation of isolation devices and software.
A genuine vaccine is essential to stop the spread of the virus in animals and humans and other organisms and is often used in combination with a viral agent to combat serious infections caused by new viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop vaccines from the S protein to produce long-lasting and potentially lethal antibodies and/or protective agents against SARS-CoV.
Women have tested life-saving vaccines against SARS in fish.
However, the true efficacy of these vaccines in elderly and critically ill individuals and their safety against animal-derived viruses is not known until real human studies are initiated.
It is probably because SARS has been around for 17 years and no one else has been infected since then.
In contrast, individuals and groups will continue to contract MERS in the Middle East and spread to other areas through animal transmission.
Women have developed the MERS vaccine by killing the virus, cell DNA, viral vectors, microorganisms, viral-like substances and viral protein fragments and other animal tests.
Developing an effective and robust vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-infected populations is critical and a major effort to slow the spread of the pandemic.
However, the challenges are difficult to overcome due to the long time (about 18 months) required to develop vaccines and the wide variety of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show its impact on a small number of people.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without any symptoms.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 will cause panic among those infected and death among those who are severely ill.
Therefore, modeling for disease diagnosis is essential for clinicians to prioritize their work, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on studies of women in humans, these factors may influence or correlate with the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Table (Table33):
Age: Age is a key factor in determining the prognosis for SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most prevalent in the 30-65 age group as 47.7% of cases were over 50 years of age in the 8,866 subjects surveyed as described above.
Patients in intensive care have shown more symptoms and pain and have been more frequently present than those without symptoms (compared to ages 66 and 51), suggesting that age is one of the factors that will determine whether a person with COVID-19 will survive.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to affect males than females (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Other symptoms and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care may experience more respiratory distress and heart failure.
Heart disease was also a leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be homologous to ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and previous illness are closely related and can be intertwined.
Laboratory-based damage: The level of CRP in the blood is a measure of the severity of the damage or pain in the veins and is said to be one of the factors that contribute to the development of the disease, which helps to find a cure, and ultimately to the survival.
The correlation between CRP intensity levels and COVID-19 prognosis was also discussed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may be useful in determining whether or not a person will survive.
These enzymes are produced in large quantities in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are produced when tissue is damaged.
Thus, it is often the cause of heart or liver failure.
Major symptoms: Chest X-rays and mild progression of symptoms should be considered along with other factors to determine whether a person will recover from COVID-19 and whether it will be severe.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as a treatment for viral infections to reduce the severity of the pain.
Due to the use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed anemia and had lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, low-dose and short-term steroid therapy should be used in patients with COVID-19.
Depression: As discussed above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many people developed depression due to prolonged quarantine and anxiety and the death of family members and other patients.
Medical advice and long-term care are essential to help patients overcome their stress and return to normal life.
Based on the studies of women, it is likely that COVID-19 has some characteristics that are different from SARS.
In addition to being highly transmissible through the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through the upper respiratory tract and produce mild or no symptoms at the onset of infection, as do other cold-causing CoVs.
As a result, people with early or pre-exposure may be exposed to high levels of the virus in their daily activities, making it difficult to fight the pandemic.
However, SARS-CoV is likely to be transmitted during severe illness, but high transmission rates have not occurred in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and more difficult to control than SARS.
Intensive efforts will be made in China to restrict travel to Wuhan and surrounding cities and continue the country-wide quarantine in the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the economic and social consequences of such efforts, the number of new cases will likely decline, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The best estimate is that the eruption will end in March and the period of decomposition will take 3-4 months.
However, some scholars disagree.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, believe that COVID-19, which is estimated to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimate that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 has detected trace amounts of turbinate and throat swabs from patients who recovered and were discharged 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the new virus may become a recurrent illness similar to influenza.
However, positive signs of a decline in new cases have been seen in China, indicating that current approaches are working.
Early predictions of Ebola would have killed nearly a million and half a million.
But through strict quarantine and quarantine, the disease is finally overcome.
It is also possible, as with SARS-CoV, that the potency of SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened and eventually become extinct or become a less potent virus for humans.
A comparison between COVID-19 and SARS and MERS is below (No. (No.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by previously infected objects.
They also found the virus in feces, suggesting that it may have originated in feces and entered the mouth.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41 percent of the patients were not infected by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with other infections and 40 doctors or nurses.
Therefore, we need to take a strong stand to protect people - especially doctors, social workers, family members, friends, and even neighbors who have had contact with infected persons.
The first line of defense that can help reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; the use of medical masks and N95 respiratory masks (number # 1860s) will help to prevent the spread of the virus.
A medical mask prevents the fluid from leaving the infected person to the air or to other objects, where it can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (number # 1860s) can protect against viruses at a minimum of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can be fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm across.
Because the components can be absorbed by combining five medical masks, physicians who come into contact with patients should wear N95 masks (number # 1860s) rather than medical masks.
In addition to masks, doctors should wear good gloves to reduce the chances of contracting the virus.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his sore eyes.
Hence, doctors should wear a white mask or glasses when treating patients.
For all people who are in or may be in areas with the virus, it is important that they all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay home and self-quarantine and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
Two metres is the minimum distance that people should stay away from a sick person.
Taking these steps is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading.
Even if SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new human virus, it is very similar to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020, which should have been a warning to many in China given the extensive knowledge of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the public by saying that the new virus is highly unlikely to be transmitted and transmitted by humans and that it is difficult to contain and control.
This news caused a lot of uncertainty, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the crucial time to stop the spread of the virus in Wuhan was lost.
The Chinese National Institute of Disease Control may learn from this misunderstanding and make appropriate changes in the future.
For example, such organizations should (1) be more careful when speaking publicly because they are trusted by the community and can influence behavior and decision-making; (2) be cautious and dispassionate about hospital information rather than waiting for reports from doctors or officials; (3) take strong action to combat the epidemic at its onset rather than trying to convince people; and (4) develop effective and effective strategies to help people better understand the risks of disease and to test and respond to such emergencies.
The COVID-19 outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has made it seem like SARS has returned.
However, there are also significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for preventing the disease and curing the disease.
COVID-19 is more likely to affect older adults than young adults and men than women, and is more likely to be fatal and life-threatening in older adults than in young adults.
SARS is more likely to cause death than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 have been infected even when they were asymptomatic, but SARS patients only transmit the virus in severe cases, making it more difficult to prevent COVID-19 from spreading than SARS.
This may explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more widespread and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
With a normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test, there may not be any further cases of COVID-19.
However, survivors may be re-infected.
These factors greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
For COVID-19 research to move forward quickly, there are several key areas that need to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% similarities have been identified between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-derived SARS CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Which animals did the virus transmit from their natural habitat, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions #1 and 2, we cannot stop it from spreading, and it can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, we do not know exactly how the virus enters the upper respiratory tract and causes mutations.
Does the virus also interact with ACE2-like cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot know what is the most effective and effective treatment for it.
How long will this illness last?
How does the virus spread through the bloodstream?
Will it become a global pandemic, endangered like SARS or recurrent like influenza?
It is important but may take a long time to find answers to the above questions and many others.
But whatever the cost, all we have to do is stop the epidemic and get our lives back to normal.
Human coronavirus is animal-derived
The evolution and adaptation of the coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, have been under control for decades.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) do not cause serious illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has highlighted the potential for HCoVs to cause severe and fatal outbreaks.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 placed CoVs at the forefront and surprised us with their rapid spread but decreased infectivity compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are animal-derived and identifying the animal-derived HCoVs will also be helpful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats but are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carriers of other HCoVs have also been identified.
Identifying the vector is a major factor in the fight against human infection.
Identifying the relationship between animal and human CoV carriers can also be of great help in diagnosing human CoV infection.
In this article, we will briefly discuss what we know about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery and their origin in animals and the organisms that help spread them.
The importance of this is that we can identify and distinguish many HCoVs based on how the virus develops and how the genome is assembled.
The current 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is discussed in this article.
In addition, it discusses the requirements for successful modification of pathogens and their consequences in the course of viral development and progression.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of highly active RNA viruses.
Viruses with genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses have been called CoVs because they appear crowned in the electron microscope.
In its body, CoVs do not have identical cut-off genomes.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two open sets (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated between pp1 and pp1ab into proteins.
Many proteins are further processed to produce 16 non-spore proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for the structure of proteins, including the spindle (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Certain proteins also encode for different strains of CoVs.
Based on the variation in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four main classes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), and beta-CoVs are composed of multiple HCoVs and are divided into four classes (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence suggests that bats and mice are the primary genetic source for many alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, but birds are the primary source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over millennia, CoVs have often been found at the border of the environment and some have become viruses of human origin.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The remaining five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory coronavirus disease (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are usually associated with mild symptoms, such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly emerged SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly active, severely inhibiting the lower respiratory tract in many patients at high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other lung disorders.
The first detection of HCoV-229E, B814, was made in nasal swabs of cold-blooded patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, several studies have helped to better identify HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which have been shown to have low-symptomatic outcomes.
In fact, the idea that HCoVs were harmless was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the worst epidemics of modern times, claiming more than 8,000 lives and nearly 10% of the population dying.
Within a decade, Middle Eastern respiratory disease (MERS) had become a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula and had spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings are issued and the world is preparing for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs originated from animals, namely bats, mice, or other domestic animals.
The majority of evidence suggests that all HCoVs originate from bats, where the viruses tend to live and not react but are highly diversified.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major blow to medicine, science, and the social and cultural life of China and the world.
Animal tracing of HCoVs' origins helps to understand the evolutionary history, regulatory forces and barriers to the migration of the species.
It may also lead to or assist in the identification of the habitat, migration and adaptation of the host animals that carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the efforts to prevent its spread in the future.
In this article we briefly discuss the origin of the HCoVs, how they are transmitted from other organisms and the HCoVs.
In particular, we are highlighting and discussing the important fact that the major HCoVs do not cause disease in the environment but become pathogenic when they are transferred from one organism to another.
We also discussed how HCoVs evolve and how frequent transmission to other organisms makes them less pathogenic.
The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this article.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first detection of HCoV-229E, B814, in nasal mucous membranes of people with the common cold, CoVs had already been detected in a number of animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent years, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of the HCoV detection in this sequence (Table 1) will be useful and informative.
The first detection of HCoV-229E was made in the respiratory system of patients with leg-containing respiratory disease in 1966, and it was subsequently isolated from WI-38 tumor cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E had a high frequency of cold-like symptoms with sore throat, wheezing, sore throat and fever and cough occurring in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 emerged from tissue culture and passed into the brain of a soil-sucking mouse.
The symptoms of HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is very similar to respiratory tract infections, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally prevalent, and are usually transmitted in the winter.
The time between the two viruses' appearance is usually less than a week, followed by a period of about two weeks.
According to a free human study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E often get colds.
Only a few patients with poor health developed severe respiratory illness.
SARS, also known as  pneumonia, was the first documented HCoV to cause a pandemic in human history and was derived from SARS-CoV, the third human HCoV to be identified.
The first case of SARS was apparently in 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
SARS has infected 8,096 people and killed 774 people, spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the carrying materials, it was found that each recipient could distribute the drug to at least two people, with a mean time of 4-7 days for the drug to appear and to become active on the 10th day after receipt.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience muscle aches, diarrhea, fever, joint pain, and chills, followed by shortness of breath, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Lymphocyte retention, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase are among the most common SARS symptoms.
Alveolar degeneration, premature release of epithelial cells and elevated macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20 to 30 percent of those infected are admitted to the intensive care unit and will need ventilation.
Also in the lower respiratory tract, many organs such as the digestive tract, the urinary tract and the kidneys can be damaged in severe cases, often leading to an increase in cytokines, which can be fatal in people with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first detected in a physical test of the fecal matter of a relative of the infected person who had moved from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many advances in the research of HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It has been found to be prevalent among adolescents, the elderly, and those with respiratory and respiratory illnesses.
Nasal symptoms, conjunctivitis, fever, and respiratory illness are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another study reported that the same virus was isolated from a nasal swab taken from an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Even though it was discovered in the Netherlands, it spread to the rest of the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been shown to cause about 4.7% of respiratory infections, with most cases occurring during the early part of the tropical, monsoon, and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 also causes laryngitis-induced respiratory infection, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been associated with severe asthma.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been identified worldwide, causing respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are highly adaptive to humans and are generally rare because they do not cause severe disease, although the accident was caused by unknown causes and rare cases of a highly active HCoV-NL63 variant, which was recently reported to cause moderate respiratory illness in China.
In most cases, when HCoVs can be transmitted safely between humans and remain in the body, they are less potent or less curative.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the urine of a 60-year-old patient with severe diarrhea and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases were from the Middle East, it has spread to other populations through occasional close contact in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another small outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 deaths.
MERS symptoms are similar to SARS, which is often associated with severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed severe renal disease, which is not the same as MERS among other HCoV infections.
More than 30 patients had symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were over 2,500 confirmed cases and 34.4% deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses.
Around the end of December 2019, cases of respiratory illness previously identified as SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory illness a global public health emergency and has named it COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 cases of the virus worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 percent, while the outlying countryside is 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; it is expressed by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other patients also had diarrhea.
Lung disease is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly become a respiratory illness.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in that they produce 82% more nucleotides, they are divided into several subtypes and disease groups.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less aggressive but more transmissible when compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in asymptomatic individuals and may have contributed to its rapid spread globally.
The correlation and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal similarities and differences that are of particular interest.
First, the time taken for the disease to develop and the time taken for the disease to last are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 has major similarities with the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is related to the presence of SARS-CoV and four other HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In some cases, SARS-CoV-2 causes symptoms commonly seen in human HCoVs, including the development of unknown, mild, or no symptoms.
In some cases, a small number of people with severe COVID-19 infections may also be diagnosed with SARS-CoV infection, although the incidence is somewhat low.
The virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and is a virus of the human genome.
In addition, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of HCoVs in humans.
In the remainder, further consideration should be given to whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is decreasing after human infection as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces.
Although the human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fecal matter is of fundamental importance, the development of SARS-CoV requires further research to fully explain this in the future.
It is of particular interest to know whether SARS-CoV-2 can be seasonal as is the case for human HCoVs.
However, certain aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and its mode of transmission, its formation and its spread after contact with humans will influence the spread of COVID-19.
All human HCoVs produce small, typically human-caused pathogens.
Alternatively, it may also be true that females are more susceptible to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be infected with the HCoV pandemic in the past and survive.
The HCoVs that infected humans and those that infected humans with HCoVs were eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must be generated from a perfect human population so that new ones can emerge to fight environmental barriers.
In this way, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 is present and the greater the number of people infected, the greater the chance of its transmission to humans.
If it is well established, it is unlikely that people will be able to control transmission by quarantine or other means of infection control.
For decades, four human-borne CoVs have been circulating in humans, providing cold-blooded individuals with immunity.
These viruses do not need to be hidden in animals.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and are not capable of preventing their spread among humans.
It would have to remain and spread only among animals and seek opportunities to infect humans, usually by means of one or more effective vectors.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four other human HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as human-borne HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than human-transmitted HCoVs but less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt to humans and move among them without the aid of propellers or animals.
Before discussing the origin of HCoVs, it is worth discussing their characteristics and development, composition, habitat, migration and HCoVs' specificity.
Animals are the primary site of HCoV development when they are inhabited by a single ancestor with a strong affinity for nucleotide growth.
The virus' progenitor is highly adapted and does not transmit disease to the host.
Similarly, a HCoV-carrying organism is known to be highly conserved over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is susceptible to infection and a suitable site for storage of the HCoV or the virus that causes it.
However, if the HCoV is introduced into a suitable host before or near human exposure, it does not adapt well to the new environment and is often pathogenic.
This secondary habitat may be a pathogen and plays a key role in its propagation by allowing the virus to reproduce and then enter the human body and spread as it infects more people.
HCoVs can cause a fatal infection if they are not controlled by the spread of a second host.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to a secondary habitat and even persist in their native habitat.
In this example, the second home becomes its ideal home.
Epidemiological data showed that SARS patients have a long history of contact with pets.
Studies of the disease-causing organism suggest that commercial animals have a higher resistance to SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and a vivverin dog in live animal markets were first identified to have SARS-CoV-like viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV.
They supported it by observing that other SARS had been detected after the killing of all civets in the markets.
However, masked palm civets from wild or agricultural areas without being marketed as live animals have been identified as SARS-CoV, suggesting that these civets may be a secondary habitat for the SARS-CoV virus rather than its primary habitat.
Interestingly, since 80% of the animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, we can also assume that some mammals are a secondary habitat for SARS-CoV viruses.
These are all endemic SARS-CoVs.
A detailed study of animals that host SARS-CoV has shown a strong association with the CoV bat, SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese iron horse bat.
These bats have antibodies that fight SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
Both this bat and the bat CoVs contain 88-92% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV.
This research has helped to develop a new theory that bats are the carriers of human diseases.
It has also been observed that many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) originate from bats, but only WIV1 among all can be classified as a live virus.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the protective agent of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from bat feces was used to demonstrate how bats, civets and humans use ACE2 as a receptor for invading cells.
Importantly, the serum of people recovering from SARS could kill the VIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, as it is 95% nucleotide identical.
Although there is a large degree of similarity between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that WIV1 is not the secondary host of SARS-CoV and that rats are not the host of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of the interaction of MERS-CoVs in a cohort with CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 mosquitoes.
The CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses use a resistant, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to introduce the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-associated RNA polymerase is a small pathogen that is closely related to other beta-CoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, we have not been able to detect any live MERS-CoVs in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related CoV-HKU25 have 87% of the same nucleotide sequence.
As a result, bats are unable to reach the primary habitat of MERS-CoV.
However, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels from the dromedary species are susceptible to MERS-CoV, which is a common immune-killing agent, as are camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
MERS-CoVs of similar biology to the human virus have been isolated from the nostrils of camels, suggesting that camels are the habitat of MERS-CoV.
It is also important because often mild but significant signs of viral transmission have been observed in camels tested for MERS-CoV.
Significantly, infected camels spread the virus not only through respiration but also through feces to the mouth, which is also the route the virus travels from bats to us.
However, questions remain as many MERS patients had no contact with camels before the outbreak, either from a donor or from an unknown MERS-CoV-infected animal.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% of the same nucleotides as the bat CoV RaTG13 obtained from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so extreme that it is not possible to make a single conclusion.
This means that bats cannot be a site or secondary host for SARS-CoV-2 unless we find a future bat-like CoVs.
It appears that the animal that is the secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be among the wildlife that is being sold and killed in the Huanan seafood market, where most of the COVID-19 viruses are believed to have originated, suggesting that humans may have been infected by animals.
Several studies on the metagenome suggest that a group of endemic animals called pangolins (Manis javanica) may be ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The genome of the new CoV pangolin is composed of 85-92% of the same nucleotides as SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are very similar to RaTG13 in that they are 90% identical at the nucleotide level.
It is a member of two subfamilies of the SARS-CoV-2 plant-derived viruses, which share a common source (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, 97.4% of its amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are significantly different, although they have strong similarities at the genomic level.
A previous study of dead pangolins showed that they had a virus in the lungs, and were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study uses alternative methods to combine and cure to extract a genome that is within 86.3% of the total length of the virus genome.
It is not ruled out that pangolins may be one of the secondary hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there has been recent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is actually derived from pangolins due to differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolins that are similar to beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much smaller than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the beta-CoVs.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other animals is not yet known.
Although there is a close relationship between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have a large number of similar genomes.
The most significant similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin RBDs of beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is attributed to their high growth and differentiation rates.
There are differing hypotheses for the association between a SARS-CoV-2- and beta-CoV pangolin and RaTG13 in the fourth generation of wild animals.
The most common method of evolutionary recombination is the beta-CoVs.
The jury has not yet determined which animal is the source of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the pathogenicity of HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses originated from rodents.
The coronavirus ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has reportedly been detected in North America, and the tricolor bat was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is similar to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, but was reported to have a secondary habitat in camelids.
For clarity, the new evidence that HCoVs are of animal origin is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic, and are known to be highly pathogenic.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from one organism to another for human transmission from animals around 1890, it was reported to have caused a respiratory illness.
The evolution of HCoV-229E from one organism to another is not clear.
The alpha-CoVs of bats have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is one alpaca alpha-CoV.
There is considerable evidence that the virus originated with bats and was transmitted directly to humans.
First, it is humans, not alpacas, who have encountered bats in their habitat.
Yet, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-derived alpha-CoVs are distinct and do not cause disease in bats, but alpha-CoV alpaca caused respiratory illness in their hosts.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not detected in animal feces.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas have been infected with HCoV-229E alpha-CoV from humans.
Indeed, bats are the origin of many viruses that infect humans, including the rat virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have been the first human to transmit the HCoV-229E virus.
Or, even if alpha-CoVs are the same as the bat's blood supply to CoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may be the second most common host host for human viruses, as was the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of how the virus has been transmitted from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV strain from bats is known from early observations and subsequent observations have led to speculation.
Bats are known to carry a wide variety of viruses that are spread among different species and transmitted from one species to another.
Singing, group living, close contact and strong flight abilities are ideal for bats to be a "virus-spreading" species.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for a long time.
They have become so accustomed to the camel that it is no longer a second home but a suitable and comfortable place for them.
MERS-CoV is not highly pathogenic and is most commonly transmitted in these animals.
The spread of the virus to humans is a risk and will continue to be a risk as the MERS-CoV outbreak cannot be traced.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV outbreak, the role of pangolins, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is variable.
In particular, beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They will be a deadly target for SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs, as will civets for SARS-CoV.
There is a high probability that SARS-CoV-2 will cross-transmit from animal to human, but it will require future studies to confirm this.
First, bats may be the host of SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share a habitat with bats by killing them or by laying coal mines.
First, pangolins may be one of the second most likely sites for the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.
People contract the virus through killing and eating animal flesh.
It is possible that mammals and even domestic animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Research on domestic and wild animals to produce antibodies is particularly useful.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third organism that came into contact with bats and pangolins.
Research is ongoing to determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to these potential animal strains, three key aspects of the virus that are also important in the treatment of CoVs are the introduction of other organisms.
First, it is highly RNA-bound and reproduces.
Unlike other RNA viruses, the mobility of CoVs can be considered both  normal and  severe and is estimated to occur in ~10-4 cases per year in 2 regions, depending on the type of CoV adapting to its new habitat.
CoVs have a specific exoribonuclease reading, killing which can lead to a high rate of replication and reduced activity or even growth.
Interestingly, the key nucleotide of Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV generation by blocking this exoribonuclease and RNA-derived RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in humans.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is almost one million times higher than the average.
Also, the rate of mutation was often high if CoVs did not adapt to their new environment.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
In a sense, it has adapted to a new habitat near people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also includes MERS-CoV, which is highly adapted to dromedary camels.
In theory, it is because the genotype mutation will produce a vaccine and antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to make it less potent.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs has some influence on mutation and replication, thus increasing their replication capacity, and is conducive to the emergence of new CoVs when conditions improve.
This is based on the way the proteins are activated and the protein is activated to produce the 3 end of the genome.
Third, CoVs are mutated spontaneously and often when they modify RNA through the unusual process of selection-replication.
The host and synthesis site often change during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Multiple RNAs of similar length and small genomes can combine to produce new CoVs.
Phyllogenetic evidence of normal interaction has been observed in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bat and batCoV-HKU9.
The relationship of the virus to the host virus in terms of its transmission
In addition to the three viral traits mentioned above, the environment is another important factor in the transmission of viruses from one species to another.
In particular, the SARS-CoV interaction has been described as a model, suggesting that it spreads disease when it is transmitted from one organism to another.
Based on the differential analysis between human and civet SARS-CoVs, it appears that SARS-CoV will continue to evolve rapidly in its host environment, particularly as it interacts with RBD of protein S.
RBD of the S protein of the CoV is usually associated with the host cell and is primarily determined by the target antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD has a 318 to 510 amino acid sequence in the S1 region, which is associated with human ACE2 and other viral infection sites.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in many animals, including bats, civets, mice and wolves, thus facilitating the transmission of the virus from one organism to another.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been identified as distinct from human and civet virus in RBD and 4 of these have a receptor that is associated with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV civet has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which increase the affinity between the receptor's ACE2 and the target protein.
In other words, two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 is a similar virus to SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 phase of the S protein suggests that the association of its S protein to human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, a cryo-EM study found a 10- to 20-fold higher association between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-S protein S.
It will also be important to determine whether additional agents are required for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with another S subtype.
There are several other HCoV receptors, including aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-sialic acid acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be useful in the way that CoVs can adapt to humans after being introduced from animals in the environment.
In addition to host cells, the effects of HCoVs on the translocation of organisms are influenced by their interactions with other host and inhibitory factors.
The protein differences in human host and host hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents may be a barrier to transmission from one species to another.
HCoVs must replace their host and modify their inhibitory properties to be able to pass from one organism to another.
In this case, the molecular basis for the key relationship between the virus and the host is still unknown and will require further research.
Efficient detection of genome-dependent and inhibitory factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology may be helpful.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to basics
Variation of bat CoVs provides a number of factors for the emergence of new HCoVs.
By definition, bat CoVs are the source of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene synthesis also contribute to HCoV evolution and are two key steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the genetic coding of proteins has the potential to dramatically alter the interaction between viruses.
Among the SARS-CoV protein subtypes, ORF8 appears to be important for human adaptation, as SARS-CoV bat viruses have isolated it but have been shown to be a secretory variant of the ORF8 protein.
They found that they killed the 29-nucleotide isolated SARS-CoVs in the early stages of human infection.
This killing separates ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mechanism for its migration.
In addition, SARS-CoVs may also be associated with the alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where many sub-combinations have been detected with RNA derived from polymerase RNA.
The fusion sites were also found in nsp9, most of nsp10, and fragments of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV virus has been found to be involved in several strains, which were produced by Saudi Arabian camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, interactions have also been observed with other HCoVs, including HCoVs that have interacted with other animal CoVs in their genes.
Care should also be taken that the wrong choice may lead to unintended mutations in the virus-carrying genome, and it may weaken the virus by exposure to such a force as the immune system of its host.
One example of this is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype, which was caused by the destruction of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be found in HCoV-229E-related bats and camel viruses, alpha-CoV alpacas showed an increase in single nucleotide, causing a change in the frame.
Last but not least, the development of new HCoVs is driven by environmental influences.
No or minimal symptoms were observed when bats were exposed to CoVs, suggesting a mating between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are anatomically and physiologically very similar to CoVs.
For example, the effective excretion of the saliva from bats has reduced the infection potential of CoVs.
In addition, the killer cell was killed by elevated NKG2/CD94 and showed low levels of severe histocompatibility of class I molecules.
In addition, high levels of oxygen-rich samples (ROS) from the bat's high metabolism can kill the CoV or be generated and influenced by its exoribonuclease readings, thus helping to influence the pathogenic viruses if they are able to select a new target.
Many CoV infections can also develop through mating, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or proteins to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause minor symptoms in their habitat such as bats and camels.
It is usually transmitted without the use of an immune system.
This is where the cells that detect the most serious cases of the disease are located.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivity of the immune system and cytokines in the immune system, which causes severe damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in patients without symptoms, the congenital antibodies to the CoVs are double active.
Similar methods of immunosuppression may have a positive effect on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon is particularly effective against bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I even in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be highly effective.
Also, the stimulation of NLRP3 by the inflammasome in bats is not effective.
Based on these hypotheses, the stimulation of NLRP3 by the inflammasome along with MCC950 may help in the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a consequence of a common cause of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs appear to have 95% of the same nucleotide sequence as SARS-CoVs, bat-CoVs have 96% of the same nucleotide sequence as SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to have similar viruses to SARS-CoV, the new habitat for SARS-CoV-2 is similar.
It has been found that pangolin beta-CoVs are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be a common habitat for these viruses or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the final genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or deliberately synthesized.
CoVs have been a topic of renewed interest in the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of whether HCoVs originate from animals and host animals before they are transmitted to humans.
There is no conclusive evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans via other host organisms.
As SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-civet interaction in markets, closing raw animal markets and killing existing civets may eliminate the SARS infection.
In this context, pangolins should be removed from raw animal markets to prevent animal transmission, as evidence suggests that many beta-CoVs derived from pangolins are related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future studies will help to determine whether humans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins and other animals.
In the other half, MERS-CoV will infect camels for a long time.
Camels play a vital role in transmitting the disease to humans, as do meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local population.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to kill all camels to combat MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the recurrence of MERS, we need to conduct robust research to develop a valid vaccine for camel MERS-CoV, and to implement additional precautions to combat the disease.
While we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genomes can cause new diseases.
Most CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, animal CoVs can be expressed in a wide variety of ways.
There is a high probability that these animal CoVs will reproduce and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that will spread more and/or kill more people in the future.
The practice of eating wild fish in some parts of China must be stopped to reduce human contact with animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 plaguing us, we need to prepare and plan for them.
Indeed, many viruses have been on our planet for centuries.
They remain in their nest until they have a chance to emerge.
Although bats have many traits that contribute to the spread of these viruses, we can reduce the risk of contact with bats and other wildlife by educating people about the dangers of these animals.
Monitoring mammals is essential to identify the presence and habitat of CoVs, which will help prevent the transmission of the virus from animals to humans and its re-emergence in the future.
Finally, the best way to prevent animal-borne viruses is to keep people away from the wildlife habitat of the infected animals.
At present, no further information is known about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats have transmitted the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to understand how bats and pangolins coexist.
Second, if bats were the first to transmit the virus to humans, we need to know how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal is the second true habitat, it would be necessary to explain more fully how it interacts with other organisms, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals and even pets may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and surveillance should also be undertaken.
It is expected that bats, pangolins or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or other similar viruses, will be identified in their future habitat.
Continued monitoring of these data may help to determine how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in animals, and this has a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19.
Up-to-date information on cases suspected of being infected with COVID-19 and confirmed cases is essential
On 6 February 2020, our association published a consultation on the emergency response to the 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus pandemic, providing a framework for our response to the global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is still ongoing, so our knowledge and expertise is gradually shifting to the current records and clinical tools that are known; thus, the diagnostic strategies and procedures that are followed are being kept up to date.
In this letter, we responded to a commentary with our support and provided the most recent clinical criteria for the proposed and approved CSAs following the latest Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by officials of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, was followed by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.
On 11 March 2020, WHO defined COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2, our organization has expanded the emergency advisory support available online through the Military Medical Records of 06 February 2020.
It has been widely read since its publication.
But be aware that COVID-19 is still present, and our knowledge and experience will therefore gradually increase with the availability of existing records and clinical tools; thus, the diagnostic strategies and medications that are followed will be kept up to date.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has published seven editions with other contexts changing dramatically.
Now that our support has received a comment from Zhou et al., they have introduced a simple scoring system based on their clinical experience.
Their work has increased the humanitarian response and has made a significant contribution to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their important work and thank them.
However, their work also requires up-to-date evaluation of the Diagnostic and Treatment Assistance for COVID-19 (Test Version 7) studies of young people.
In the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the selection of case studies requires the combination of one phase of the epidemiological history with two phases of clinical manifestations to make a complete analysis, or it is necessary to complete three phases of clinical manifestations if no epidemiological data is available:
Epidemiological data: (1) travel or residence data in Wuhan and its vicinity, or other COVID-19 cases reported within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (2) contact data for SARS-CoV-2 cases (nucleic acid test positive); (3) contact data for fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its vicinity or other data where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (4) end-stage case data (≥ 2 cases with fever/respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in rural areas, e.g. home, school, office, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count at baseline.
The diagnosis of an approved case must be either case-specific with at least one isolated case or serological evidence as follows: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a genome-wide sequence that shows increased homogeneity to previously identified coronaviruses; (3) a positive selection of specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in IgM of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or an increase in titer ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase over the case-specific phase.
We note that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid from respiratory or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Separate detection of blood samples was added in the first (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes in detection followed work that by finding rapid diagnostic tools for optimal nucleic acid detection, along with a respiratory tract sample and a blood sample, led to a wide range of assumptions, and helped to bring the specific antibody result positive to the accepted criteria.
Furthermore, the evidence of these disorders reminds us that we should monitor patients who are atypically symptomatic and asymptomatic.
To follow, the chart of Zhou et al. should be kept up to date, as the clinically asymptomatic patient was assigned a low risk.
The scoring system should also be verified with additional clinical tools and studies.
Finally, we hope that the permanent evidence will be added and the readers will be invited to submit their observations.
To ensure that the diagnosis of cas is considered and accepted, all patients should follow and comply with the appropriate national treatment.
Our team will also provide updates on our emergency response.
Bangladesh reports three more deaths from COVID-19, than any other day
Yesterday, Bangladesh reported five deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
This is the highest death toll from the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 cases and 33 home survivors.
17 people died.
In online media, IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the dead were two men and two women.
For Dr. Meerjady, two are in their 60's, two are under the age of 51, and one is under the age of 41.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on January 11.
A hospital worker told Anadolu Agency, the local media outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Anti-Theft Commission, who was at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a media video, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said that buses will be closed for several days, including next Saturday.
The bus closures began on March 26 and were scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Essential goods  medicines, fuel and food  may pass.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on 8 March, with two people from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three were rescued.
SARS-Cov-2 infections more than one million worldwide
As of Thursday, the number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus virus had exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins data.
52 deaths were due to COVID-19, a coronavirus-related disease.
The winner was the day Malawi and Zambia had their first coronavirus case.
North Korea reported the first coronavirus-free state on Thursday.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 cases and 79,332 as of 1 to 10h European Time (0800UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, and 5,900 deaths, have been reported.
CBS reports that, after Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus death toll was 1,000 on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have imposed strict regulations to curb the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the quarantine until May 1.
In every country, President Vladimir Putin has declared that Russians will continue to receive their salaries even if they do not go to work by April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the lockdown to 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes to 10, with one abstention.
In Saudi Arabia, the quarantine was extended to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a day; previously, the quarantine was only for 3 pm and 6 am.
Thailand was scheduled to have a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the city will impose curfew on May 1.
How much plastic paper can one person buy
On Sunday and Saturday, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles introduced a policy of buying one or two paper clips per person at all local stores.
ALDI also introduced the one-man rule on the first day.
These rules were written on the outside of the shop and on their Facebook page.
People were buying in bulk because COVID-19 could lock people out.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also introduced restrictions on home delivery services and how much paper can be purchased.
The next four orders were made in person at Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in his March 8 newsletter, said that the four-person rule was in place, with some shops selling out within an hour of the goods and citing the demand for more, while ALDI, on Facebook on Tuesday, called it "excessive".
Sales have surged in the past week, says a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costo's store in Canberra also ended up with two fires last week.
To alleviate the supply shortage, Coles ordered more, Woolwoths ordered more, and AlDI ordered Wednesday's deliveries days in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are increasing sales, but the local law is a real problem.
People know that the power of production must increase to satisfy human needs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the launch of the specials, some stores will not have the specials on Wednesday.
In a report by news.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that shops are open to the public.
He found that the paper was a large, but short-lived, and fast-moving product, which left empty shops, which further increased the fear of depletion.
"Coles and Woolworths are right that if there were more items in the store, if things like paper towels and hand sanitizer could be bought in bulk, then more bombs and chairs", says Russell Zimmerman at ABC News.
The paper-generator Who Gives a Crap said they were out of supplies on Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, a Kleenex paper maker, and Solaris paper maker Sorbent, said they are working 24/7 to meet demand, according to news.com.au.
Domain.com, the real estate service, reported that some landlords were offering free greenbacks to the first bidder, when people were less likely to buy because they had nothing to do on Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of the NT News, Darwin's reading islands, had eight pieces of paper that could be cut to help with the papermaking.
Previously, retailers were reluctant to regulate, with the Australian ABC reporting on 3 March that they were reluctant to cut back on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman noted that there is also a growing need for other items, such as masks, sanitary products, dry food, hand washing, and flour.
And, outside Australia, on Monday, Ocado's store in England reported that people were buying less of Andre's papergenic than two packages of 12.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19  SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease  a pandemic.
Although the name "pandemic" refers to the long-term, not the severity, of the disease, WHO has seen a need for governments to take action:
All countries can end this pandemic.
If countries are detected, they can test, provide humanitarian assistance, lift quarantine and sanctions and mobilize for war, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO.
we are afraid of how it is spreading and how nothing is being done.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States, pandemics are "miracles".
He said that, according to CNN's February report, "apart from influenza, no other respiratory illness has followed in the wake of the pandemic or the global outbreak".
Ghebreyesus also said, "We are still not seeing a pandemic that is not related to the coronavirus".
He also says, and who do we not see this pandemic that can be stopped.
The pandemic designation stems from the decision by WHO in January to declare it a global health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that "the situation will get worse".
On Thursday, the United Nations reported that among the 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, 4,600 had died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the respiratory virus coronavirus disease type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was first identified in Whuhan, China, in December 2019, became a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million people were infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
364,000 people are saved.
The mortality rate is 4% in China, 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications include pneumonia, difficulty breathing.
If the disease is present, it will take five to 12 days for symptoms to appear.
Neither vaccine nor cure is known.
To prevent infection, wash your hands, cover your nose or mouth if you cough, stay away from people, and be sensitive to those who are quarantined because they have been in contact with an infected person.
Authorities around the world have enacted laws to block roads, quarantine, curfews, workplace safety equipment, and lockdowns.
The pandemic has caused global economic disruption, disruption of sports, churches, politics and entertainment, and a global shortage of goods due to over-consumption.
Schools and universities are closed globally or in cities in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the population.
The virus is widespread on the internet, and xenophobia is prevalent among Chinese, East Asian and Southeast Asian communities and those in the affected areas.
After road closures, carbon emissions to the atmosphere are reduced.
Officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) detected a high-level case of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and the study began to diagnose it in early January 2020.
The cases were from a Huanan animal market and the virus is said to have originated there and is zoonotic.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of bat coronavirus, the coronavirus of the papillomavirus and SARS-CoV. The first case of the virus was reported on 1 December 2019, and the patient was not identified as originating from the market.
Of those who became ill in 2019, the majority of cases were reported to have come from the market.
On 13 March 2020, a report from South China Morning Post reported that the outbreak began on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man in Hubei.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported a decline in cases in China but a rise in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with cases exceeding those in China.
It may mean that we do not know how many people are infected among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the number of people with measles was young, with the proportion of those aged 19 and under falling to 2.4% in the country.The head of the UK's National Science Foundation, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the population in Britain would need to be infected for the human body to be able to tolerate it.
The number of cases of COVID-19 cases, which tests indicate positive, is determined by the law.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries have imposed no-testing policies for people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published between 16 March and 23 October in China found that 86% of COVID-19 cases were undiagnosed, and they were responsible for 79% of the cases.
A report published on March 30 found that the number of cases in Italy was higher than predicted.
The prevalence of (R0) COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time between symptoms and death is 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of those who died were aged 60 or over, and 75% had other conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be higher, but it does not include untested individuals such as those in home, nursing homes, and many others.
A partial study from Italy found that the number of COVID deaths was 4-5 times higher than previously thought.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that the To know that (national mortality rates) are not accurate because they are low, according to U.S. reports. Such low mortality rates are common in infected individuals, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine fever pandemic.
The Chinese death toll was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the non-Asian death toll was on February 14 in France.
On February 28, in addition to Chinne, dozens more people died in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, there were 40 confirmed cases of the disease in all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary from place to place, and depend on the testing, clinical status, treatment, when the outbreak began, and other population factors such as age, sex, and health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate among those infected was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number of its stations.
In China, the mortality rate among those infected is 17.3% (for those with symptoms as of 1-10 January 2020) and 0.7% (for those with symptoms as of 1 February 2020).Other measures are the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of those infected and dead, and the infection rate (IFR), which refers to the percentage of those infected (test-result) and dead.
These statistics are not timely, but follow the evolution of the world and the population.
Many academics have tried to find these numbers for large populations.
The Center for Medicinal Studies at Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39
The above figure is one of the German COVID-19 Etid, and the statistical study will include CFR tests.
WHO says that this pandemic is manageable.
The duration of the pandemic is unknown and varies from region to region
Maciej Boni of Penn State University says, "If not properly understood, the disease can decline if its habitat is lost".
But there is no way to know what these days will be like.
The Chinese government's official study on Zhong Nanshan suggests that the  could be completed by June if all countries follow WHO recommendations on how to monitor the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine predicted that SARS-CoV-2 would survive for one to two years.
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other necessary measures are recommended for the time being for vaccination (possibly 18 years or older).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't know if it's the coronavirus because it's going to be forgotten soon, it's going to go away forever, and it's going to be a disease that's going to come and go, it's going to come back any year".
The length of its return depends on how strong the body's immune system is and whether it becomes more powerful.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be so numerous that people who are infected may not recognize them.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent).
Minor symptoms include physical weakness, respiratory illness, hearing loss, shoulder strain, joint pain, motor pain, headache, cold and tremor, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO estimates that one in six people will develop severe illness and respiratory distress.
In the U.S. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists risk symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain or chest pain, loss of consciousness, difficulty walking, shortness of breath, and urgent hospitalization if these symptoms are present.
Some cases may be asymptomatic, with no symptoms but with diagnostic tests, so researchers suggest that those who have been close to those who have been tested should be more sensitive.
China says the number of people without symptoms may be as high as 44 percent.
The time to recovery (from onset to onset) is one to 14 days; the average is five days.As a result of unconsciousness, the number of COVID-19 cases with hearing loss decreased from 30% to 15%.
The way the disease is spread is known.
It is believed that the disease is spread by close contact with humans and by small saliva produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; proximity is 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that the gnat can travel between 15 and 27 feet (4.5 m).
Some suggest that the virus can also be spread through long-term exposure to airborne microorganisms, which is caused by human speech, respiratory fluids, and movement, where the virus is not present in the air.
Water droplets can leak from the mouth or nose of nearby people, and can be inhaled.
Injecting a tube into the spine for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory droplets to form in the body.
It can also spread by contact with the skin, skin, eyes, nose, or mouth.
Some say it can walk in the mud, but this one is only slightly frightened.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the feces.The virus is highly transmissible in the first three days after symptoms, but can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms and in the final days of the virus.
People are diagnosed three days after infection, which means that the virus can be spread by those who have no symptoms.
Only a few laboratory studies have shown that asymptomatic cases are present but symptomatic cases have been observed in other countries when tracking those who were close to those who were infected.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECD) says that it is not known exactly how the disease is spread, one person can spread it from two to three people. The virus can survive for hours on surfaces.
The virus was detected on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 steel three days ago, for one day on cardboard, and four days on copper.
However, this depends on whether the environment is warm or cold.Dogs and other animals can be infected with COVID-19.
No studies have shown that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the UK authorities have recently recommended that people wash their hands after touching animals, especially after touching the mucous membranes of infected people.
The Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new case, the first case of which was identified in patients with pneumonia or respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 strains are localized. Outside the human body, the virus can live on soap and then be absorbed and killed. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the SARS-CoV family.
They say it may have come from the animal kingdom.
Genetic analysis has identified coronaviruses in Betacoronaviruses, in areas of Sarbecovirus (B-pathway) association with two from bats.
It is 96% identical to the bat-derived coronavirus (batCov RaTG13) genome.
In February 2020, a study in China found that the only difference between them was the amino acid in certain parts of the human and primate virus genome.
The entire genome is found in 92% of the human and ancestral coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 strains, which cannot be attributed to ancestral disease.
Post-viral infection can be detected in the symptoms, but the diagnosis of this condition should be made by internal polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected areas on a CT scan.
The difference between PCR and CT in Wuhan is that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but it is not as clear, as many images are seen in pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology stated that CT scans may not be available for new COVID-19 patients.
WHO published a manuscript of several RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 August.
The test was able to detect the presence of polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed with a blood sample or a sample of blood.
Results will be known in the next few hours or days.
But these tests are done by nasal and oral swabs. Several laboratories and companies are doing serological tests that will detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be true due to the large number of users.
In the US a serological test product developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use only for laboratory use.
Radiographic and computed tomography (CT) images of asymptomatic patients are in opaque glass and most blood clotting has not been performed.
The Italian Radio Society is working on a web-based platform to provide images of patients.
Because it is highly resistant to many infections such as adenovirus, the shadow of PCR blindness is too short to detect COVID-19.
A large study in China that looked at chest CT and PCR results found that the images were too slow, too fast and too poorly interpreted, to be considered effective in the fight against the pandemic.
Artificial intelligence to detect the presence of viruses in the human nervous system by radiography or CT.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include proper hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the face, nose, or mouth with unwashed socks, and coughing or itching in clothing and immediately throwing it in the trash.
Those who may be infected should wear a mask outside the home.
Social distancing is also included.Many governments have suspended or restricted non-essential travel in pandemic areas.
Yet, the virus has become a global epidemic.
This means that the virus is spreading among the population, with some cases of unknown origin and where they were infected.Physicians who treat patients should adhere to the recommendations of social distancing and surveillance.Tracking of the population is critical for authorities to identify the source of infection in order to stop it.
The government's help in locating the phone has alarmed the public, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations for their surveillance of the public.
Several mobile phone applications have been developed to help, as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen students were working on privacy, in addition to enabling Bluetooth to track the proximity of people to other phones.
People will then receive a message that they were in close proximity to someone with COVID-19.The current trend in preventing infection, including washing the nose and mouth with mouthwash, is not entirely accurate.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many organizations are working to make it available.
Hand washing is required to prevent the spread of disease to humans.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, after using the toilet or if hands are dirty; before eating; and after rubbing their nose, coughing, and itching.
This is because outside the body, the virus can be spread by household soap, which will destroy its shelter.
The CDC also recommends that handwashing with a 60% less acidic solution than soap and water is less effective.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The sites may be contaminated with solvents (within one minute of exposure to the disease by sterilizing the microbe with iron), and 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hygrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chroxedine gluconate, are less potent.
The CDC advises that if a COVID-positive person is seen in a hospital or suspected to be COVID-positive, as well as in workplaces, classrooms, shower rooms, living areas, electronic distribution devices, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines that the patient touches, they should be cleaned.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with a handkerchief or a cloth to cough or itch, and dispose of them immediately.
Medical masks are required for those who are ill, as wearing a mask may block the flow of urine when speaking, itching or coughing.
WHO has set guidelines for when to wear masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, says that wearing a mask can prevent people from touching their face, as this is the most common route of infection. Masks can also be worn by someone caring for someone who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at risk of infection, especially those who are caring for a COVID-19 patient, but also notes the need for people to avoid touching their faces.
Many communities are now requiring people to wear masks outside.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing plastic face masks.China recommends wearing disposable face masks for those who are not infected, especially when they are within 1 meter (3 ft) or less of other people.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when on buses or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people wear masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, restrictions have been imposed on people who do not wear masks.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear masks when going outdoors for their own safety and to protect their friends.
The Australian government has mandated that everyone entering the marketplace must wear a face mask.
Israel has required people to wear masks when outdoors.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has required all passengers on trains and buses to wear masks from 1 April.
Panama has adopted a mandatory outdoor policy, and has also introduced a package mask at home for those who cannot afford a mask.
Masks are widely produced in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (or social distancing) prevents infections that can slow the spread of disease and reduce social cohesion.
Other methods include quarantine; road closures; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can help to avoid social distancing by staying at home, avoiding roads, avoiding public places, avoiding touching people, and avoiding social distancing.
Many governments are imposing quarantine orders in areas with high infection rates.
The US government says that people can only be a group of 250 or less (if COVID-19 is not detected in their church) or 50, and then say 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of two or more people. Patients with diabetes and other health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a compromised immune system may be at risk of serious illness, the CDC recommends staying at home in areas where infection is widespread. As of late March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities have adopted the term "distancing" to "distancing", meaning that your vaccination should be remote but should be conducted online or remotely.
The term "distancing" means that people should communicate with others, be private, but should communicate if they can.Some governments have introduced sexual distancing in the pandemic.
There is a sex-only option for a roommate who is not infected or has no symptoms.
Home quarantine is required for those with COVID-19 and suspected cases.
Health facilities have recommended effective quarantine.Many governments have either imposed or mandated general quarantine in areas where the disease is present.
Strict quarantine orders are issued for those who are susceptible to infection.
Those who have been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have traveled from areas or regions with high infection should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
How to combat the spread that is halting or slowing or reversing it.
Early detection of the outbreak is followed by the identification and quarantine of infected individuals and the development of post-exposure prophylaxis and vaccination to reduce the incidence of the disease in the population.
When it becomes difficult to control the spread of disease, the key becomes: slowing the spread of the virus in the church.
The work of finishing and reducing can be done together.
Reduction requires more work to reverse the pandemic by reducing its spread per person. Monitoring disease is slowing the spread of the pandemic pathway, which is called pandemic mitigation.
This has reduced the risk of hospital overcrowding and allowed time for the development of a vaccine and a vaccine.
Non-medical measures that can help and contribute to the spread of infectious diseases include hand washing, masks, quarantine; strict social distancing policies such as closing schools and restricting mass gatherings; strict religious belief in these practices; and strict sanitation in the city. Other strict regulations were adopted in China when the risk increased, including citywide quarantine and road closures.
Some countries have enacted laws to contain the virus.
South Korea has introduced strict testing and quarantine measures, and restrictions on movement.
Singapore has paid for those who have quarantined themselves and imposed penalties for those who have not.
Taiwan has ramped up the production of masks and has waged a war against those who stockpile masks in large quantities.The UK-US example (slow but slow the spread of the pandemic) was a stronger response.
The final rule could help hospital staff reduce visitor numbers by two-thirds and reduce mortality and suffering among hospital staff.
The containment may be effective but should only be continued if the virus is still present in the population (or by the time the vaccine is available), as the spread is reversed if the population does not advance the containment measures.
Long-term policies to end the pandemic will be costly to the economy and society.
There is no cure for COVID-19, but there is a role to play, and to test available treatments.
Taking a prescription cough medicine, drinking water, and getting enough sleep can help with the symptoms.
If it is too severe, oxygen therapy, throat-filtering, and respiratory systems may help.
Steroid therapy can be a misunderstanding.
Many of the symptoms have been approved for treatment with vaccines and other viral infections are being studied for treatment for COVID-19.
WHO also recommended that "community and home vaccines" may help to alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing and decreasing the number of hospitals for the needs of COVID-19 patients is a key component of the fight against COVID-19 according to WHO.
ECDC and the European office of WHO have issued guidelines for specialist hospitals to provide additional health care facilities, including laboratory treatment for COVID-19 testing, restricting additional patient needs, isolating or quarantining those with COVID-19, and increasing treatment by teaching leprosy patients and having multiple respirators in beds.
There is a lot of information about the origin of the first patient (called patient zero).
The first case of the novel coronavirus may have emerged on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose sharply.
They were people from the streets of Huanan market, which also sold live animals, and some sources say the virus is animal-derived; others say it is zoonotic. Several cases of pneumonia were reported on October 26 and were treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei City Hospital, Jianghan CDC in Wuhan reported on October 27.
On 30 December, the medical community at Wuhan City Hospital informed the community that a new strain of the SARS-like coronavirus was circulating.
Eight priests, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for reporting the attack, Ai Fen was fired by his superiors for causing the accident.
The Wuhan Metropolitan Health Commission released a report on 31 October and informed WHO.
Most cases of pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health officials for diagnosis in early January.In the early days of the outbreak, the number of cases rose sharply from seven to half a day.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other cities in China, aided by the New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a major transit hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 cases per day, with two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of cases in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million people were infected worldwide; more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
I had a patient in 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries restrict movement and block roads.
People are under a state of quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, lockdowns, or quarantines) and a curfew.As of April 2, 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under similar quarantines in the United States, over 50 million people are under quarantine in the Philippines, over 59 million are under quarantine in Africa, and 1.3 billion are under quarantine in India.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion tons of the world were quarantined, which means that 2.6 billion people in the world just two days ago would have been quarantined  almost all of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, with some reports suggesting it may have been on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian had seen multiple cases of pneumonia on December 26, and his hospital later notified Jianghan's Wuhan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic tests in patients on 27 December 2019 identified SARS-CoV-2.
The Wuhan City Health Commission released the information on November 31.
WHO also issued a statement that day.
During the protest, the priests in Wuhan prevented them and the police from lying about the incident.
The National Health Commission of China has stated that the pandemic is not transmitted between humans without any evidence.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a campaign called by Communist Party political secretary general Xi Jinping to "fight" the spread of the virus.
In what has been called the "biggest quarantine in the history of the world", the health campaign began on January 23 to block entry and exit from Wuhan, which was implemented in 15 cities in Hubei, for a total population of 57 million.
Public transportation was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Moon Festival (January 25) was over.
The authorities also began construction of the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later established, the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat the sick.
In addition to new hospitals, China has also set up 14 sites in Wuhan, including stadiums and sports venues, and hospitals.On January 26, the government began monitoring the spread of COVID-19, and providing toilet facilities for those who were traveling during the Spring Festival.
Universities and colleges in the country closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong have introduced a number of regulations, particularly regarding university education.
Remote work began in the slums of China.
Road closures were imposed in Hubei.
Buses arrived in different directions, and the Chinese border was blocked.
Traffic controls were implemented in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) were placed under lockdown.Following the outbreak in March, the Chinese government imposed strict restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading to other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine on all foreigners, and as of March 23, China had only one case of the virus in the country in five days, from a person returning from Guangzhou to Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of the disease to those in the country had been contained and China had been closely monitoring the outbreak.
On the same day, the roads in Hubei were closed, leaving Wuhan, two months after the quarantine.The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hubei said on 26 March 2020 that visas and entry permits could not be issued on 28 March and onwards, without specifying when the ban would expire.
Those who wish to enter China will apply for a visa at the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government granted a state holiday to the companies on 30 March, and a small stipend to the owners.City officials called for a day of mourning at 10:00 on 4 April, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, but the central government urged people to remember online to observe social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 first broke out in South Korea on January 20, 2020 in China.
The health center reported an increase in cases on April 20, due to a meeting held at the Daegu Shincheonji Jesus Church.
The Shincheonji who visited Daegu in Wuhan found themselves responsible for spreading the disease.
As of February 22, 9,336 Church members, 1,261 or 13% had symptoms.South Korea had the highest number of cases as of February 23, 2020.
By February 28, more than 2,000 people were infected in Korah, up from 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean testing centers have quarantined three test subjects who tested positive for the virus.
Air travel was also affected.South Korea launched the first and largest covert mission to test the virus population, and to quarantine those infected and track those in close proximity.
The testing service was first-come, first-served so that those with symptoms from abroad could report via a mobile app, public transportation and virus testing and increased testing to 20,000 tests per day.
It was found that South Korea's surveillance program was effective even without the imposition of quarantine.South Korean society was devastated by President Jae-in's comments on the crisis.
Many Koreans signed for his dismissal for what they called a poor treatment, or for not liking what he said.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the shortest survival rate in four weeks because it had only one person.
On March 29, it was announced that from January 1, all foreigners would be quarantined for four weeks.
According to the authorities, as of April 1, South Korea had received requests for testing materials from 121 countries.
Iran detected cases of SRS-CoV-2 on 19 February in Qom, where according to the Ministry of Health and Statistics, two deaths occurred on the same day.
The government began a swift process of closing concerts, sports, Sunday services, and universities and other educational institutions.
Iran has spent three trillion dollars on fighting the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that they would not place quarantine units in areas where there were disease centers, only they would go into quarantine.
The city's roadworks began in March, but the traffic jams were severe before the beginning of Ersian Nowruz.
Shia places of worship have closed to pilgrims as of March 16, 2020.Iran became the country with the highest number of cases after China in February.
Despite the allegedly secretive spread of the virus in Iran, the last ten countries reported their first case from Iran on February 28, saying the outbreak was more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
The Iranian parliament was shut down, as 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on 3 September.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iran's prison authorities to release human rights activists and temporarily release other detainees.
It said the risk of the virus spreading is high in prisons, which lack adequate hospitals.
On March 15, the Iranian government recorded 100 deaths in one day, the highest number in the country since the pandemic began.
Twelve Iranian government officials died of the disease on March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 cases per hour and one death every 10 minutes from coronavirus.
According to WHO, the Iranian population may be five times higher than the estimates.
It is also said that the US restrictions on Iran are affecting its economy in the fight against the pandemic.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the end of restrictions that are plaguing the economies of countries due to the pandemic, such as Iran.
The pandemic broke out in Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases have been so rapidly increasing that the Italian government has called for a halt to flights from China and has called the situation a national emergency.
The highest number of COVID-19 cases was reported, starting with 16 cases in Lombardy on 21 February, on 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced new measures to monitor the pandemic, imposing quarantine on more than 50,000 people in 11 cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas hit hard by the pandemic, entry and exit will be impossible.

Tests for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus also include virus detection and antibody-generated immunity.
The presence of the virus in the samples was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and its purpose is to detect the RNA of the SARS-COV-2 virus.
It is used to detect new or old diseases.
Antibody detection (serology) may be performed for diagnostic and surveillance purposes.
Antibody testing is a measure of the number of people who are infected, even those whose symptoms are too subtle or who have no symptoms.
The true mortality rate and overall immunity level can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and there are significant differences in how countries perform this testing.
This difference can also have a profound effect on the mortality rate, which is likely to be very low in many countries.
Using the technique of post-translational polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be performed on respiratory echanthylons obtained by various methods, including nasal samples or a cough sample.
Results usually appear within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing of coughing produces positive results only if the disease is present in the first week.
The virus may then disappear from the throat but continue to be reborn in the lungs.
For patients who have been tested in the second week, this may be done by drawing fluid from the inner airway through a catheter or a fecal tube.

It searches for all E genes present in all beta coronavirus and specific RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI was the first company to receive approval from the Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority of China to develop a PCR device for testing SARS-COV-2.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its latest 2019-2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel testing kits to all laboratories using the International Reagent Resource.
In our three genetic tests with previous models, the test kits were not producing adequate results, and the difficulty of testing at the CDC in Atlanta led to the testing of 100 samples per day in February 2020.
The two-phase testing was found to be ineffective on February 28, 2020, after which state and local laboratories were permitted to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the tests under emergency authorization.US laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that the community could begin to test for COVID-19 using RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics is recommending that the country's population begin COVID-19 testing on March 9, 2020.
No final figures were given; sampling and testing must be done in accordance with CDC guidelines.
In Russia, a COVID-19 test kit was developed at the VECTOR Center for Viral Research and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the Ministry of Health approved the testing.On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic is launching a COVID-19 test machine.On 13 March 2020, the FDA approved Roch Diagnostics to perform tests that would take 3.5 hours at maximum doses, allowing the machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA approved Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA has already approved the use of Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA approval from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved tests that require the use of isothermic nucleic acid instead of PCR.
The foot does not need to change temperature, a method that can give a positive result in less than five minutes and a negative result in less than 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott researchers will perform 50,000 tests per day.The test, which uses a specific antibody coupled with the nucleocapsid (N-protein) proteins of the new coronavirus, is being tested in Taiwan, hoping to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the flu test.
In March 2020 the journal reported that ba chest X-ray is not particularly useful in the early stages, but CT [computer tomography] may be available even before symptoms appear.
CT components include simple multi-layer mirrors with peripheral, asymmetrical and external joints.
The subpleural is large, powerful and active during infectious disease.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan at the onset of the disease found that CT is more effective than PCR, but has less accurate results, and some of its images are more sensitive to pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CTs should not be used for detection or as a first-line test for COVID-19. In March 2020, the CDC recommended that people use PCR in the first instance.
For immunity, antibodies can be produced including IgG and IgG.
It can be used to diagnose human disease within 7 days or more after symptoms appear, to assess immunity, and to monitor people.The test can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or in a treatment center (PocT).
The most sophisticated automated systems in most hospital laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their capability will depend on the number of people each system can handle.
CLT usually involves a small sample of blood, although more samples may be used to determine the strength of the immune system.
For PoCT, a sample of skin and tissue blood was usually taken.
Unlike PCR, step-by-step methods are not required prior to initiation.As of March 26, 2020, the FDA has designated 29 sites that are subject to mandatory reporting and can now distribute their own antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one test for emergency use.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval to begin using their diagnostic devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in virus-containing blood samples.
They are able to perform multiple tests on samples per hour and will perform faster than standard PCR for viral RNA testing.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits purchased were safe.
Hong Kong introduces a system of quarantine for suspected cases, whereby the emergency department will give patients a tube, where they will be discharged, returned, and then sent for testing. The British NHS announced a system of home-based testing for suspected cases, which will prevent the patient from transmitting the disease to others if they come to the hospital or cleaning the ambulance if they use it for one person. In testing for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a doctor takes a sample with extreme caution.
Vehicular testing centers have enabled South Korea to provide rapid and widespread testing worldwide.In Germany, the National Health Insurance Agency said on March 2, that it has the capacity to perform nearly 12,000 tests per day with ambulances and 10,700 people in the past week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is required by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the tests allowed many major cities to conduct tests.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tested cases in Germany is unknown, as only positive cases are reported.
The first laboratory survey conducted in the week of December 2020 revealed that approximately 483,295 samples were tested and the week of December 2020 was followed by 33,491 (6.9%) samples with SARS-COV-2 infection.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a new method and tested samples on 64 people at a time, with the sampling and only testing of many samples being infected.At Wuham a 2000-square-meter high-risk laboratory named H-Yanuo (Chinese: 火眼, or 人眼) was commissioned on February 5, 2020 by the BGI, with a capacity of 10,000 samples per day.
In a five-day study led by BGI founder Wang Jian, Hubei's production would have been 47% higher and the cost of quarantine would have doubled if the testing process had not been initiated.
Huo-Yan in Shenzehen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, followed quickly by the Wuhan lab, followed by a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the daily testing capacity had reached 50,000.A new, multiplexing system developed by Origami Assays can test COVID-19 samples from 1,122 patients using just 93 tests.Effective methods can be implemented in small laboratories without the assistance of robots.
In March, the lack of adequate testing became a major concern in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to develop a method to use samples that would require exposure to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to generate RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates is testing more of its population for coronavirus per day than any other country, and has already done so on a large scale.
It was achieved through a variety of strategies, including the purchase of a large number of laboratory tests from Group 42 and BGI (following their Huo-Yan rapid diagnostic laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory can perform a maximum of 100 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operated outside China.
Several coronavirus testing methods are being tested in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has endorsed the German proposal to send testing machines to developing countries that cannot produce their own.
The German technology was released on 17 January 2020; the technology was not available to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until 28 January; it prevented the US testing. China and the US were initially concerned about their testing equipment being inadequate, and the countries in Australia were unable to provide adequate equipment to meet medical demand.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's ability to test has slowed the spread of the new coronavirus.
The ability to test, especially in private laboratories, has been developed for decades by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that testing programs are the most effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19 early.The increased demand for testing in response to the spread of the disease has led to many US laboratories being unable to perform testing and lacking the resources to collect samples and test drugs to detect the disease.
In March 2020 China announced that its testing machines would not work properly.
In the United States, the CDC's testing equipment was "defective", so the government lifted restrictions on private laboratories from testing. Spain purchased testing equipment from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be unreliable.
The company said that the negative results could be due to improper sampling or machine usage.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the machines that had given negative results, replacing them with machines from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test machines that the Czech Republic had purchased from China had given negative results. Slovakia had purchased 1.2 million test machines from China but had been poorly tested.
Prime Minister Matovič said that they were dumping it into the Danube.Turkey's Health Minister Ates Kara said that the machines Turkey had purchased from China were "very bad" and not "provided for use".The UK had purchased 3.5 million test machines from China but in early April 2020 said they were not usable.
Testing, subsequent quarantine of infected individuals and follow-up of people who have been in contact with SARS-COV-2 patients has been successful.
The study, which will be conducted in Vò, Italy, where the first COVID-19 case in Italy was reported, will test nearly 3,400 people twice, over a period of about 10 days.
About half the cases were asymptomatic, and all infected individuals were quarantined.
Travel was restricted in the area, preventing some from contracting the disease at all.
With strict contact monitoring, travel restrictions, medical testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus in Singapore spread more easily than in other developing countries, but without stringent restrictions such as closing restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun a curfew on March 28, but schools have reopened for the March 23 holiday.
Many other countries have also taken aggressive measures to combat the epidemic, including contact tracing, travel bans, testing, and quarantine, but some countries have taken less aggressive measures, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Data-driven studies have found that countries that provide more testing, in terms of mortality rates, have fewer deaths, perhaps because those countries have the ability to detect people with little or no symptoms.
WHO states that countries with adequate testing facilities and government laboratories that do not have adequate knowledge of COVID-19 send the first results of the first 10 positive cases and the first 10 positive cases to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories for further evaluation.
Of the 16 approved laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the ranking % of cases is based on the country's testing system.
A country that uses screening only for hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of cases than countries that use screening for the general population, with or without symptoms.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, and other impurities.
Washing hands frequently with soap at "special" times of day prevents the spread of diseases to many people, such as diarrhea, which is passed through the mouth and passed through the stool.
People can also contract respiratory illnesses such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (such as body fluids).
The five most important times of the day when washing hands with soap is necessary are: before and after shopping, after cleaning a baby's toilet or cleaning a dish, before feeding a baby, before eating and after cooking or touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with dust.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating a patient.
After removing and dressing the baby or washing the baby from the toilet.
After touching your nose, coughing, or itching.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene in the medical profession.
Washing hands before administering medication or treating a patient can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The primary reason for handwashing in the medical field is to remove harmful substances (viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and other substances that can harm or cause disease.
It is essential not only for those who handle food or work in the medical field but also for all mankind.
Handwashing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other diseases; preventing the passage of diarrhea-causing substances; and reducing respiratory infections.
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that hand-washing can affect the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the number of deaths from respiratory and diarrheal diseases among children can be reduced only by making changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the infant mortality rate by almost 50 percent.
Activities that promote handwashing can triple the incidence of diarrhea, and are as important as providing clean water to developing countries.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap, the simplest and least expensive way to prevent diseases such as diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARIs), is an essential practice that should be practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Acute ARI pneumonia is the fifth leading cause of death among children at sea, claiming nearly 1.8 million lives each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of hand washing with soap before eating and after urinating can save more lives than any vaccine or medicine, halving the number of deaths from diarrhea and one-quarter from acute respiratory illness.
Handwashing is usually accompanied by other water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against the effects of contagious rubbing.
The only downside to hand washing is that frequent hand washing can contaminate the skin and dry it out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin rash, called eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is a common medical condition.
Excessive hand washing is also one of the symptoms of what is called an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five main times at which hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the risk of infection from urination: after urination (swimming, shopping), after washing the baby (removing and dressing the dish), before feeding, before eating and before/after cooking or touching raw meat, poultry, or chicken.
Other times when proper hand washing is a practice to prevent infection include before and after treatment of wounds; after urination, coughing, nasal contact; after handling animal waste or animal contact; and after handling sewage.
In many countries, few people wash their hands with soap.
A handwashing survey conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. In 2014, a study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was near the midpoint at 77%, and China was the lowest at 23%. Many practices are now changing the practice of handwashing with soap and water at special occasions.
The "Health Essentials Program" implemented by the Philippine Ministry of Education is an example of a series of actions to improve children's health and education.
Two yearly flushing, along with daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing, and toothpaste, are important parts of the local program.
The women in Indonesia use it and produce excellent results.
The best way to remove germs from the skin is to add soap or water to the disinfectant.
The main role of soap and cleaning products is to open the door to treatment, and to increase its effectiveness.
Water alone is the best cleanser for the skin, since the oils and proteins found in the earth's crust are not destroyed by water.
However, the best way to clean the water is to add enough water.
Solid soap, because it can be reused, may contain bacteria from previous use.
Some studies of the transmission of bacteria have concluded that strong soaps are not pathogenic because they are washed with foam.
However, the CDC says that "soap-free water is the best way to prevent the spread of disease".
Many health care providers recommend using disinfectant soaps.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that people are being encouraged to use antiseptic or antibiotic products to kill the world's viruses.
However, soap often contains a highly antibiotic-resistant agent such as triclosan, which contains most of the world's most infectious bacteria.
Thus, even if the antibiotics that are absorbed are not soap-based, they may not be as effective as the antibiotics that are administered.
In addition to topical and skin-protective ingredients, complex products may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lastic acid) such as pH adjustment, benzoic acid, which is a disinfectant, and other skin-damaging ingredients (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). Research by the University of Oregon School of Public Health suggests that the soap in our bodies is as effective as the antibiotic soap that contains triclosan to fight infections and remove germs from the hands.
Soft hand washing does not kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
However, the soap-filled bath water is more efficient at cleaning out grease, dirt, and germs than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of human wastewater does not help to remove germs from the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not use water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol hand sanitizers, hand antiseptics, or hand sanitizers) became widely used.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with a compound such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in water, or foam to improve the efficiency and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding liquid hydrogen peroxide increases the effectiveness of antibiotics, with antibiotics containing between 60 and 95% alcohol being the most effective.
Alcohol-containing antibiotics kill bacteria, germs resistant to grain antibiotics (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including AIDS, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
A 70% alcohol hand sanitizer kills 99.97% (reducing log by 3.5, and decreasing decibel by 35) of hand bacteria 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing log by 4 to 5) of hand bacteria 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is highly effective at killing bacteria but not at killing other viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are highly resistant to norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, which are commonly transmitted through the urine.An antiseptic or alcohol hand sanitizer should be made in large quantities that will either completely soak both hands or will be coated on top of them.
Before and after both hands and between the hands and rinse the fingertips for 30 seconds until water, foam or gel dries.
It also involves washing the fingertips, rubbing them together with both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of using hand sanitizer, especially if the hands are very dirty.
Hand sanitizer is widely used because of its ease of use and quick disinfection; however, it is not a substitute for proper hand washing with water, and should only be used if soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can dry the skin unless they are supplemented with hand sanitizers.
The effect of alcohol on hand-drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other hand sanitizers.
In human trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with hand sanitizers have been found to be less skin-sensitive and less hand-drying than soaps or disinfectants.
The skin often did not turn red, produce berries, and resist alcohol or other drugs.
The use of non-red-tinging products instead of handwashing soap and water has become popular.
Despite its strength, water-based hand sanitizers do not remove organic matter from hands, but they do keep them clean.
Therefore, hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many germs, as germs remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is largely dependent on the ingredients and the manufacturing process, and it appears that the best hand sanitizer is the one with the lowest alcohol content and the one with the lowest alcohol content.
Until recently, benzalkonium chloride was effective in killing bacteria after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its potency with prolonged use, perhaps because of its high levels of skin lesions.
In poorer areas, people can buy soap and use dust or dirt instead.
Dust or soil may be more dense than water itself, but it is not as dense as soap.
One concern is that contaminated soil or dust can increase the spread of disease rather than inhibit it.
Like soap, dust is also a cleanser because it forms an alkaline solution when mixed with water.
WHO recommends using dust or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The following are the recommended handwashing practices by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease:
Wash hands with hot or cold running water.
They suggested using running water because players sitting together could be infected, and the temperature of the water is irrelevant.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap is a good disinfectant, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly and for longer periods of time when soap is used than when water is used.
Apply the soap for at least 20 seconds.
This helps to clear the skin of germs, and prolonged dressing kills many germs.
Wash your hands thoroughly with the running water.
Wiping with a towel can make the hands more infectious.
Dry with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet hands are susceptible to infection. The areas that are often not properly cleaned are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and the soles of the fingers.
Toenail wipes and nail polishes can be contaminated.
It is often recommended to use a hand sanitizer to prevent dry hands, which can damage the skin and cause a risk of infection.
Most inexpensive lubricants can be used to assist with hand washing where water and/or soap are not available such as pouring water from a top-mounted container or cup with suitable holes and/or using dust as needed in developing countries.Where water is scarce (e.g. in rural schools in developing countries), there are no water-saving measures, such as tippy-taps and other inexpensive methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique of using a top-mounted, threaded, and threaded tap to pour a little water over the hands and soap.
Proper hand drying is essential for good health, but there is much debate about the proper way to dry hands in the general population.
A number of studies have shown that hand washing is more effective than a hand dryer with a high volume of water.
In 2008, a small study was conducted at the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a manufacturer of hand dryers, to understand the difference between hand dryers, hand dryers and new hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hand dryer, the number of bacteria in the fingers increased by 194% and in the hands by 254%.
After washing and drying hands in a hand dryer, the number of bacteria in the fingers increased by 42% and in the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with hand dryers, the number of bacteria was reduced, from 76% in the fingers to 77% in the hands. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether people who used hand washing and hand washing spread bacteria after several hand-drying procedures.
Hand dryers, which produce air at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can transmit microorganisms to areas in the urine and to other people within 2 meters of the urine.
Using a hand dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 metres of the machine.
Hand dryers showed at least one microbe to be transmitted.In a 2005 study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, several hand dryers were examined.
The following differences in the number of germs were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and there is a difference between hand dryers and hand dryers.
Hand drying with hand dryer is another way to dry your hands during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain 60% alcohol.
Hand sanitizers became widely used long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered their potential (in 1846) to prevent the spread of disease through hospitals.
There are many machines that remind patients to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
One study found that the use of these drugs reduced the rate of transmission.
Hand washing products are for 15 seconds, applying water and plenty of soap or oil to all areas of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together and joined together in the company of friends.
If there is dirt under the nails, a little something can be used to remove it.
Since germs can linger in the water on the hands, it is important to remove the water and wipe it with a clean cloth.
After drying, a drying cloth should be used to hold the water (and open the exit door if available).
This helps to prevent hand infection in these areas.
The goal of handwashing is to remove contaminants ( germs) and not spread them to others.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hospitals are overwhelmingly unwashed, and many doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and a simple method of cleaning can reduce the risk of blood infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a manual containing guidelines for hand washing and sanitary towels for medical use.
We can see the organization's first handwashing recommendations and can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and his colleagues made a significant assessment.
The vending machines can also test and tell if the hands are clean, if the required hygiene is adequate.
The World Health Organization has a Five Hours for hand washing:
after contact with blood/body fluid
before performing this hand sanitization, and
After treating a patient. Adding antiseptic to soap (soap containing antibiotics or disinfectant) helps the handwashing agent to disinfect.
Disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in areas where bacteria are highly concentrated.  Hand sanitization for surgery, if necessary with a water pump that can be opened or closed without touching the hands, a small amount of chlorhexidine or iodine solution, a disinfectant towel to dry the hands after washing, and a disinfectant to remove dirt and other disinfectant to remove dirt from the nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This solution should be washed with the hands and forearms to the mid-arm, usually for 2-6 minutes.
No delay in stirring (10 minutes) is necessary.
When you wipe, you should block the water from the front of the hands to the back of the hands.
After washing hands, it is advisable to dry hands with a disinfectant and wear medical gloves.
To prevent the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after treating a patient.
In clinical staphylococcal studies, the greatest benefit of handwashing was found after washing the first 20% of the hands, and the slightest benefit was achieved when washing the hands at 35%.
Washing with soap increases the rate of bacterial transmission in food three times compared to washing hands with disinfectant soap.Unlike handwashing with disinfectant alcohol, washing hands with disinfectant soap for 30 seconds reduces the rate of bacterial transmission by 26% compared to disinfectant soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based lubricants for the introduction of the influenza A virus H1N1 and clostridium difficile spores into the hands. Efforts to improve hand hygiene in hospitals may involve training staff on hand washing, ensuring the availability of more alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a lot of research on which techniques are useful in many areas of health.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap seems to be inexpensive, essential to good health, and even essential to a healthy diet.
However, the lack of water, soap, and handwashing facilities at home, in schools, and at work makes it difficult for everyone to become a handwasher.
For example, in many African countries handwashing facilities near public or public toilets are scarce, although cheaper options exist for handwashing facilities.
However, the lack of handwashing may be a common habit and not a result of a lack of soap and water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can push for legislation, promote handwashing policies and help people make a significant change in their behavior.
For it to work, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A review of 70 studies found that promoting handwashing in rural communities is important in LMICs, but the anti-hygiene campaign is far from over.One example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Ways" which encourages schools to implement simple, inexpensive measures that can make students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene measures.
If schools have succeeded in teaching a few virtues, they can now move on to the more difficult ones.
The construction of handwashing facilities may be part of a broader effort to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.
The Universal Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign that is helping people to change their behavior.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF is promoting the handwashing emoji.
Other studies have looked at the overall rate of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the DALYs warning.
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is less expensive than other methods such as water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for health, especially for vulnerable populations such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand washing: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an Englishwoman  who founded nursing".
At the time, many still believed that disease was caused by a bad smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne and human-to-human illness prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote hand hygiene and to declare it essential to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have prompted many countries to focus on handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of such a pandemic.
For example, signs with the words "safe handwashing" were placed near public laundry facilities and office laundry facilities and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash one's hands of" something, implies refusing to take responsibility for something or refusing to share in it.
It appeared in the passage in which Matthew writes that Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a common phrase in English-speaking countries.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mother Macbeth begins to wash the hands necessary to cleanse the mind of the filth, which reflects her misunderstanding of the evil transgressions she had committed and had caused her husband to commit.
It has been found that after being reminded of bad habits or if they recall them, people wash their hands more often than others, and they are more grateful for hand-washing products.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after this practice often do not participate in other more intensive forms of hygiene such as volunteer work.
Religious practices require hand washing for both hygiene and symbolism. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water rather than soap to wash hands, is a belief in hand washing practiced by many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, Tivlah and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, the Lavabo in Christianity and the Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam have mandated that people wash their hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require that people wash their hands before and after eating.
Precautions against workplace hazards COVID-19
COVID-19 occupational safety measures are the use of safety and health measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best workplace safety practices depend on the workplace and the workplace, including the risks of exposure to hazardous substances, the extent to which the disease is spread locally, and the risk that workers may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work is work that requires fewer interactions with other people and coworkers, which requires the use of basic safety measures, such as hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, contracting respiratory diseases, and maintaining a clean and sanitary work environment.
Medium-risk work is work that requires frequent contact or proximity with people you know or who may have COVID-19, but may be ill because of contact with large numbers of people or traveling to multiple countries.
This includes workers who are exposed to crowds, such as in schools, workplaces, and other public places.
Risk prevention in this group, in addition to public preventive measures, includes the use of ventilators with high-level filters, pre-contact precautions, and the use of protective equipment in contact with an infected person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers physicians and morgue staff to be at high risk for known or potential contact with COVID-19 patients, and recommends that people who perform aerosol work or touch or collect samples of people who have or may have COVID-19 be treated.
Safety for occupational safety may include protecting oneself in buildings with ventilation systems, and having adequate protective clothing for this task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can be very dangerous in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, caring for others, or fear of contact with an infected person.
Business models can change, including consumer demand, and access to goods (e.g. shopping at crowds or through home delivery).
Finally, they may restrict travel to places where COVID-19 is prevalent. Prevention can help to determine what to do to protect ourselves.
The plans cover the level of risk in the workplace and workplace, including the people you will encounter, the potential for increased risk in the home and other settings, and the risks to workers such as the elderly or those with chronic illnesses.
It also discusses how to monitor and manage these risks, and how to manage the potential consequences of this disease.
Precautions and controls will be carried out in accordance with national or local laws.
The best way to combat this is through factors such as reducing the risk of infection among employees, protecting those at high risk from previous illnesses, maintaining work, and taking steps to prevent the disruption of other companies with which you work.
The answer depends on how deeply the disease has penetrated your body.
Individual safety measures are a commonly accepted measure to protect workers and the health of the general public to the extent possible.
In areas where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the best way to combat it is to monitor the machines, then evaluate the authorities, and finally provide each person with the appropriate protection tools.
Automation means keeping workers out of workplace hazards without compromising work ethic, and it can be a good way to go.
A management review is a change in the way work is done that requires an employer or employee to change their work practices.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than mechanical or regulatory monitoring, but can help to prevent certain accidents.
Each type of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, if appropriate (e.g. respirators), wear it properly and regularly, maintain it, and replace it if necessary, and remove it properly, wash it, repair it or dispose of it to prevent infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the least hazardous occupational hazards are those that involve fewer people and fewer coworkers.
The best ways to prevent the spread of disease in the accepted workplace include washing hands regularly, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, if they have respiratory problems, covering their mouths or noses if they cough or sneeze, having a place to wipe and dispose of clothes, providing remote communication devices or other if necessary preventing workers from using other people's equipment, and maintaining hygiene and sanitation practices in the workplace.
Early identification and isolation of potential infected individuals is a very effective way to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until fever, fever, and other symptoms resolve within 24 hours without the need for fever-reducing or other symptoms, and that effective policies be put in place for effective leave, stay-at-home care, and awareness of these policies.
According to OSHA, the median occupational risk is related to factors such as people who are in close contact or within 1.8 meters of people who have or are suspected of having COVID-19, but may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 because the disease is more common in the area where you live and work, or because people have recently traveled to other countries where COVID-19 is more common.
This includes workers who come into contact with a wide range of people such as in schools, in crowded workplaces, and in other public places. Maintaining the safety of such machines requires the installation of strong air filters, the installation of high-voltage ventilators, the installation of ventilation systems such as air-tight itches, and the installation of window blinds for those who receive customers. The emergency response team will require sick workers to stay at home, hold online meetings rather than in a confined space, impose restrictions to avoid travel to non-COVID-affected areas, create communication channels and forums to manage public health issues, provide employees with appropriate training on COVID-19 prevention practices, such as providing hands-on training, providing staff with appropriate clothing and other tools to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection, including providing staff with a safe work environment, providing staff with a safe work environment, and advising staff to wear protective clothing, hand-blocking, and other safety devices, including hand-to-hand combat equipment, to ensure that they are not exposed to the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace.
Workers in this category are not necessarily required to use respiratory aids.
If a person becomes ill on board an aircraft, the best way to protect staff and other persons is to keep the person at a distance of 6 feet, to assign a crew member to care for the sick person, and to provide a face mask or to ask the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or itching.
Cabin crew members should wear a gan when assisting a sick passenger or when touching bodily fluids or any other contagious area, and take special precautions if the patient develops fever, persistent cough, or respiratory distress.
Bags and other disposable items should be disposed of in a suitable place, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial ships, including cruise passengers and other persons on board, precaution means not traveling if you are ill, and reporting and reporting to the medical examiner immediately if any passengers have a fever or other symptoms of illness.
It is advisable to monitor the patient's health in the facility.For schools or child care facilities, the CDC will require that the facility be closed for a short period of time for disinfection or disinfection if a patient has been in the school premises regardless of whether the disease is widespread or not.
If the spread of the disease is low, you may be able to use social distancing measures such as travel restrictions, restrictions on conventions, restrictions on other major events such as physical education or school choirs or dining at restaurants, even office distancing, waiting times, avoiding unnecessary visits, and different medical facilities for children with flu symptoms.
If the disease is widespread in your area, in addition to the precautionary measures, you may have to close schools for a longer period of time.For police officers who are in regular service, the CDC says their risk is low.
Police officers who have to contact people with or who may have COVID-19 must follow the same protocols as medical personnel, including wearing proper personal protective equipment.
If you touch someone while in captivity, these personnel should clean and disinfect their work towels and tools before using them, do so with the help of a vacuum cleaner and follow the rules of safety and disposal of PPE supplies and of safety and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some medical and morgue workers to be at or below the high risk category.
High-risk occupations include delivery, nursing, laboratory, and transportation of patients with or likely to have COVID-19.
They become more vulnerable if they perform aerosol procedures, or collect or use samples from people who have or may have COVID-19.
Aerosol procedures include procedures such as intubation, coughing, bronchoscopy, or other dental procedures or examinations, or the taking of scahntillons.
The high risk of morgue operations is associated with people who work on the remains of people who died of COVID-19 at the time of death or who were suspected of having it; they are at high risk if they have a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of death.
In some hospitals and morgues, a ventilator may be a good option.
Samples should be used according to the bio-safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the appropriate quarantine of patients in waiting areas vary depending on whether they are tested positive for COVID-19.In addition to the recommendation of respiratory devices that are PPE, OSHA recommends that people work at a 6-foot distance from people known to have SARS-CoV-2, who are tested positive, or who have been infected, and perform other aerosol activities.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better should be used extensively for respiratory preventive measures such as adjustment testing, training, and clinical examinations.
Other types of respiratory products are more protective and help people to function.WHO does not recommend full-face masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO will still require the use of medical masks for the test subjects.
For people who collect respiratory samples from patients, care for them, or transport COVID-19 patients without performing aerosol procedures, WHO recommends the use of medical masks, safety glasses, or a face shield, blouse, and bag.
If you are performing aerosol work, use a respirator N95 or FFP2 instead of a medical mask.
As a result of the limited availability of PPE, WHO recommends limiting the use of PPE in telemedicine, restricting contact with people such as open windows, allowing medical personnel to enter the room of a COVID-19 patient, using only PPE that is necessary for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respiratory device without removing it when treating multiple patients with the same disease, preventing and managing the use of other PPE, and not recommending the use of masks for people without symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Lighting the way and preparing for the future
The date and time of the event: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: All rights reserved
This month has been a marvelous one.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that we are connected to each other and have responsibilities towards each other.
We do not know what the consequences will be, but we know that our successful efforts to combat them depend on the strength, cooperation, and community that are so important to this organization.
The friendship and affection we have seen among all our friends through e-mails, phone calls, and chats is a sure sign that we are working with the best people.
I thank you all dear friends and am happy to have confidence in you.
Last week, someone told me how much they enjoyed our work.
It reminded me how important it is for people to go to Wikipedia now, and it is a strong indication that useful work should be online and accessible to everyone.
Your work is the key to that, whether it is updating our social media accounts or paying our friends or protecting our community.
Right now, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a time when the world will be affected not only by what we do but also by how we do it.
Because this mission and your mission is so important, we will change the way we work together, starting this week.
Changes in assignments and schedules
As Robyn mentioned, group c met last night to discuss our work schedule and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these articles, we discuss what we think is the best way to deal with the challenges we face and the best way to keep our organization functioning in this period.
We want to take the stress off and support our work for the long term.
If you want to call us, that's fine.
For managers, entrepreneurs and all employees:
our daily work hours will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week until we change it.
It is not that you are on leave - if you are able to work more hours, you can be employed.
However, the world is uncertain, and whether you need to care for a loved one, go shopping, or see a doctor, your priority should be his health.
We will not monitor your work schedule.
If you are sick, do not come to work.
It should be done without saying it, but we will say it.
You don't need sick days or PTO - just tell your boss and help your coworkers figure out how to schedule so that important tasks can be done.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan within T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can support and help you to receive proper attention from the authorities).
They will be paid for each hour.
We have done so, and we reiterate our commitment to honor our contractual obligations to our contractors and our contractual partners.
All are paid according to the regular hours worked during normal business hours.
It also depends on whether you are ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we can help.
Many people use work as a chance to share their worries with others.
What we do can be very helpful, especially in times like these.
It will also determine how you protect yourself.
We would ask you to speak to your supervisor, to discuss what we would do and to make the necessary adjustments.
Some activities are considered essential.
There are other things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising (included) perform essential functions that may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all departments to determine our new goals and focus now on supporting the more important aspects of our work.
We all have a busy schedule, but we can concentrate on the more important things.
We may not regret it later if we give up now.
We do not plan to "double the amount" to recover once the disease is gone.
We will not ask you to work overtime to finish the work on dates that are not important right now.
We accept that things have changed, and we adjust to set new goals and dates in areas that matter most.
What will happen to the APP?
To adapt to the new circumstances and daily work hours, we would like to change the time of our 2020-2021 annual planning release.
Our proposal is to request an extension of our 2019-2020 planning period so that we can make financial arrangements that will allow our employees to focus on the most important tasks, protect themselves, and protect their loved ones when we consider who will need or want to work part-time in the coming weeks.
The extension of time will significantly increase the workload and pressure on the entire organization.
We will send our suggestions to the authorities next week and inform our representatives and teams of the next steps if we receive a response from the authorities.
We would like to thank the APP team for taking the lead in this effort.
Office status, health risks, and hygiene
Last week, we were informed that a friend of ours may have been in contact with someone who has the COVID-19 virus.
To be on the safe side, however, we used a disinfectant to clean the entire office.
They used hospital-grade disinfectants to clean the entire area, including the entrance and the elevators leading to our offices.
The building is used according to its own rules.
We feel reassured that the office will be a very nice place when we return.
Our DC office is hosted by WeWork, which has informed us of their COVID-19 safety policies and has provided them to all DC employees.
Last week, our DC office was reorganized to allow people to start working remotely in line with the guidance from San Francisco.
As some of our friends in New York City know, we also had discussions about finding a place in Brooklyn.
A series of but waiting articles.
Some of our friends will be working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime friends who work remotely know that there may be a change, and we would like to offer you some suggestions:
Make the meeting one or two hours long.
If it takes more time, see if you can do it in stages over several days.
Be clear about the purpose of the meeting, the subjects to be discussed, and the priorities.
Please specify the video to use, with tools such as Google Doc and Zoom to make the live chat more efficient and the connection more secure.
Have a supervisor to make every meeting go smoothly, someone to chat back to for questions and clues on the list of speakers, and someone to help with the notes (or help you take notes).
Email IT support if you need a good earphone.
Spend your money on food.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your friends about work
The HR team will be waiting for online meetings for guidance to help monitor the workload available for the Foundation.
Last week, we advised the public to suspend all public events sponsored by Wikipedia, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We will let them know that we understand that requiring such interruptions and other restrictions may make it difficult to keep our appointments and that it will not be anyone's fault if we postpone or change these appointments.
We will be introducing more rules next week at Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences.
The feelings of our global community are saddened by the interruption of these activities but reassured by the meaning and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and other issues.
To achieve this, CRT is preparing to create Meta-Wiki pages to provide groups with a place to monitor our influence and conversations with each other.
Keeping up with COVID-19
We will post an invitation to our calendar on Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share new information, answer your questions, and spend time with you individually.
We are here to help you in any way we can.
While you wait, you can continue to follow the news at this email, and other relevant information about COVID-19, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will continue to update these pages and to consolidate all information.
We also make an effort to keep in touch with our fellow believers in areas where the disease is particularly acute.
If you have any questions about travel, meetings, work, or coping with stress, or any other issues that require help, feel free to contact CRT and make a deal.
We are there to provide help and assistance when needed.
If you have a confidential or important matter, please contact Bryan Judan - Global HR Director.
No one should see these changes as a way to give up our privileges and assignments.
However, it is true that during this time, our work and responsibilities will change in unprecedented ways.
These are steps we feel are necessary to help each other to continue to work, provide our team with the support it needs, and serve the world with a reliable service.
Our planned work will wait until the time is right.
Now is the time to help one another and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need all of you to make it happen, so we urge all of you to protect yourselves and your families so that they are as strong as possible when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following are the most recent members of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the entire management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found on the outer surface of the (cell membranes) lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and spleen.
ACE2 inhibits angiotensin conversion to enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing ang ((1-7)), making it a potent drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also used to target coronavirus.
The human enzyme is called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme that is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 and the C-terminal nasal receptors of the carrier amino acid.
ACE2 forms a single-membrane protein type, with its role in enzyme synthesis outside of cells and other tissues.
The extracellular site of ACE2 is transmitted from the transmembrane to another enzyme called sheddase, after which the protein is released into the bloodstream and then into the urine.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is bound to the cell membrane of type II lung cells of small muscle alveolarenterocytes, endothelial vessels and muscles and soft tissue cells of the muscle and organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cortex, striatum, ypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of aCE2 is to perform ACE activity.
ACE binds the angiotensin I hormones to the vasoconstriction of angiotensin II.
ACE2 binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine by angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-pPhe) and is then cohydrolysed by the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to many peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane embouchure of the neutral amino acid that carries SLC6A19 and was implicated in Hartnup syndrome.
In the transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point for the coronavirus cells, as well as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus from which SARS originated); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus from which COVID-19 originated).
In general, the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein subunit to the ACE2 enzyme on the cell surface will lead to endocytosis and direct the enzyme virus along one of the endosomes in the cell.
This entry point involves the modification of protein S by serine protease TMPRSS2, which is being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent.This has led some to introduce ACE2 into cells, in an attempt to fight infection.
However, a few academic and legal societies have suggested that they should proceed with the required ACE and ARB therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis study published on 11 July 2012 found that ACE treatment reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34%.
However, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in ACE-treated patients who were at high risk of pneumonia, compared to those with heart disease.
Treatment with ACE was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, but the results were less pronounced than the risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel therapy for pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lypopolysaccharides in acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and it will be active for 30 minutes with a 24-hour onset.
Several studies suggest that rhACE2 may be an effective treatment for patients with renin-angiotensin-resistant (RAS) or high circulating angiotensin. rhACE2 has been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of respiratory distress.
BCOVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to track people who may have been infected with the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Many applications were made, and with government support elsewhere.
Many forms of surveillance have been developed through telephone applications.
People are not concerned about its privacy-sensitive, location-tracking systems.
Not to be overlooked among the privacy features are Bluetooth signals that alert users to the proximity of other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be rolling out Bluetooth support for the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has developed an app that helps locals know if they have been in close proximity to a person with COVID-19.
It is happening in 200 cities in China, in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being developed.
The app was developed by local IT experts, developed for public use and distributed to the government.North Macedonia launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth app that will detect infection on the patient's own device and support the government's fight against infection.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the remote monitoring app had been rolled out, and would be available in the coming weeks.Another similar app is being developed in Ireland, and in France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to use the Singapore TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocols.Russia is developing an application that will detect COVID-19 cases in Moscow, which will be designed to monitor them for outdoor exposure.
Ross Anderson, a security engineering professor at Cambridge University, said there are many potential issues with these application systems, including the measurement of the positive side effects, and the difficulty of running them properly because the application can only be used by people in the community.
In response to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Apple has limited the number of organizations that can install apps on the App Store, limiting them to government employees or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar rules.
People who have been fighting for privacy for surveillance purposes, have questioned whether the facilities are adequate and will be destroyed after the coronavirus.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have called for a policy of surveillance.
The organizations listed seven recommendations that governments can follow:
I will observe the rules and regulations in a responsible manner.
There must be a time of final vigil;
The figures will be made available only for COVID-19;
They should be in charge of the people and their names and should not be shown who is doing it;
Computer-based surveillance should be conducted in a non-violent environment;
Distribution of numbers to persons other than those who are required to do so by written rules;
There should be a way to protect the community and provide support if someone is hurt by this worker;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also written their recommendations.
Google and Apple's plan will draw attention to this surveillance by removing the system if it is no longer needed.
Some countries have enabled network tracking rather than an app, so people do not need an app and can avoid surveillance.
In Israel, surveillance by radio is legal.
Tracking with a GPS is also a form of distracted attention.
However, not all systems need to know the location of a person; most surveillance systems are built on intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, the use of the app is being considered.
In the case of the app, they have collected information from a number of sources including phone numbers, credit cards, and have used it to alert people via SMS about possible infections.
And they informed those who had passed through, and the government made the area public, which is a good thing in the eyes of the law because it happened during the MERS pandemic that occurred in the country.
Information that is publicly available in many applications and websites. Countries like Germany have proposed to use internal systems to monitor the population.
As of April 6, 2020, it has not been published.
Monitoring has been well known, with several studies since 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen students were developing a low-energy bluetooth (BLE) monitoring system to alert the nearby mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a strong internal and external service, and there is no consensus on its use.External protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact (TCN. fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensible Protocols and Telephone Tracking Mechanisms.
Under these protocols, no personal information is shared, and everything is done via the phone.
Group Prive and MIT Media Lab are developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-based data collection and service to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
From the white paper Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Privacy in a Pandemic  Released in March 2020.Another project was SafeTrade by Enigma MPZ, a company developing privacy technologies that started with their work at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrade enables automated data-processing technologies to allow individuals to choose whether to share their location and health information with other individuals and government agencies, without violating privacy laws.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was launched with a consensus on how to reduce human suffering, and to facilitate global interoperability through tracking and alerting applications, which was essential for global adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had been in possession of BlueTrace protocols used by its government personnel.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS companies announced the launch of a service to support tracking of users but also protect privacy, based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography.
A document describing the internal technology was also published.
For Apple and Google, the system will be implemented in three stages:
Developing a set of tools to help governments protect the privacy of citizens.
Installing it on iOS and Android Google and Apple want to control privacy by installing the system on the operating system, and then removing it as well
Drug recycling (also called drug recycling) is the treatment of a drug for the purpose of curing a disease or condition for which it was intended.
It is a term used in scientific studies to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.
Other studies have followed the path of vaccine discovery for COVID-19 and plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 active ingredients, all containing a ligand that binds to it.
Identifying the areas of interaction provides a feasible way to determine the efficacy of a vaccine for COVID-19.
For the SARS-CoV-2 specificity, the proteins are papain protease, RNA-related RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and al study read a combination of multiple studies that showed skeletal analysis of the effectiveness of a vaccine that could lead to the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
Chloroquine is a plant-based medicine that is used to treat immune system disorders.
On March 18, WHO announced that Chloroquine and Hydroxycloroquine would be among the four vaccines in the Alliance for Vaccine Trials.
New York State Governor Andrew Cumo said that the City of New York will begin testing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate in the U.S. Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA has not approved the vaccine but has approved it in the EUA as an experimental vaccine for high-risk patients who are hospitalized but cannot be vaccinated.
The CDC states that the use, dose, and duration of hydroxychloroquine for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is unknown.
The priests say they use the drug only when other drugs are not available.
A turkey study in Istanbul is investigating the reaction of chloroquine to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large-scale studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The College of Medicine at NYU Langone is testing the efficacy and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
In China, clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that Favipavir was extremely potent.
35 cases in Shenzhen were found to be negative within 4 days, but the duration of the disease is 11 days in 45 untreated cases.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency advised the public on the early results of the treatment.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the vaccine from Japan, and use the vaccine to deliver it to university hospitals where it will be developed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe warned the Trump administration against buying the vaccine, which may be less effective in people with severe illnesses and the virus has spread rapidly in the body.
It may not be suitable for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, produced a "no effect".
These vaccines are designed to prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
A study by researchers at the University of Colorado is developing a vaccine to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences as a vaccine for the Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences found remdesivir to be useful in vitro in the fight against several phylloxera, pneumonia, paramyzous, and coronaviruses.
One of the most important is the resistance of the virus to infection and the spread of disease.
One early study suggests that Remdesivir may be more potent.Several studies are underway, including two at the University of Cleveland; one for moderate-to-severe patients and one for severe patients.
Three clinical trials are underway to evaluate Vitamin C for patients with severe COVID-19 infection; two placebo trials in the Netherlands (China, Canada) and one non-administered trial (Italy).
New York began testing the drug azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japan National Centre for Public Health and Medicines (NCGM) is preparing to test Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide) vaccine, a respiratory vaccine for asthma, to treat people with the new coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of a 2-enzyme-transforming angiotensin is underway in 200 acute-care patients in hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to evaluate the efficacy of the drug.
Studies at the Montreal Canadian Institute of Microbiology have documented the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and respiratory complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The Etid, called COLCORONA, contains the names of 6,000 people over the age of 40 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had minimal symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or who are breast-feeding or who do not have effective contraception are not allowed.
Many blood thinners are testing it in Italy.
The low molecular weight is being developed more and more for the treatment of patients, leading the Italian Medicines Agency to issue recommendations for its use.
A study of 300 patients who observed the prophylactic and dosage effects of enoxaparin sodium began in Italy on April 14.
The SARS-CoV-2 strain is a virus, which is being studied extensively for replication, using the same vaccines used during the MERS, SARS and West Nile virus pandemics.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is safe for COVID-19 after China's 7th advisory
Umefenovir: Umifenovir is safe for COVID-19 after China's 7th recommendation
Other medicines have also been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China, the drug is also approved in the United States.
And try in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The bCOVID-19 vaccine is not valid for the 2019 virus (COVID-19).
No vaccine has passed the trial stage, and much work is underway to develop a vaccine that will pass.
As of late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had said that no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus strain, was expected to be detected for less than 18 weeks.
Five vaccines were in phase I in April.
COVID-19 was first detected in December 2019.
It became widespread in 2020, costing a lot of money and research to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are working on the genome sequencing for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
They concluded in April that the strength of CEPI's vaccine research is its speed, its ability to produce on a large scale, its ability to distribute it widely, and its ability to get it to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists announced that 10 new technologies are being developed in the early 2020s to develop a robust vaccine against COVID-19.
Several sites have been included in Phase I studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Preparation of phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vectors (Phase I of the study and candida: CanSino biology, adenovirus type 5 vectors)
According to CEPI scientists, as of April, 115 vaccines were in the early stages of development with 78 approved in the pilot phase (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others, but little is known about them (either in development or in development).
Phase I-II trials evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine and conduct immunoassays, randomized controlled trials, placebo monitoring, and multi-specification, and determine the dose.
Phase III trials consist of multiple-stage and team monitoring, and clinical trials to determine the efficacy of the vaccine, all based on the dose dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in development as of early April 2020, 74 have not been in human subjects (they were only in clinical trials).
In Australia on 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating whether a vaccine molecule could interact with a viral protein to trigger an immune response.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun the development of a vaccine, with human trials likely to begin in 2021.
The vaccine trials began at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing a vaccine for human consumption with his biotechnology partner, vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced that he and his partner Vaxart were working on a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a vaccine-style manuscript with the same technology being developed for both the vaccine and the cancer treatment.
On March 25, the head of the study institute said they had completed the synthesis and started the test.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immune-Ongologie, announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop a key peptide vaccine for COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine against candida that could be tested on patients within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced that it had begun a vaccine trial.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Medical Center, both in eastern Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a deal with Novavax Inc.
In the search for and development of a vaccine.
They also announced that they will start clinical trials and phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health said that they were working on 11 vaccines, and even if they were to be deployed early it would take them one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, announced that it was developing a particle-based coronavirus vaccine with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is in the laboratory stage, with human trials expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given $1,000,000 to CureVac for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that the German government had opposed.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 candida mRNA-based vaccine is in clinical trials that will begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, said it would have the results of the first clinical trial in April 2020 and its final vaccine could be tested on humans in the summer.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI) announced that they have committed US$4.9 million to the study of a COVID-19 vaccine team at the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI funding for COVID-19 to US$29 million.
Other members of the CEPI team for the COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccines on animals.
The Imperial College of Science in London announced that on 20 March 2020 they will begin the development of an RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
Candida vaccine was developed 14 days after receiving the recommendation from China.
As of the end of March, the Government of Canada had committed C$275 million to 96 COVID-19 studies, and several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, including Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced that C$192 million would be spent primarily on developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with the intention of creating a national vaccine bank for the production of a new set of vaccines in the event of another coronavirus pandemic.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported a test of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA-derived SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine was found to have antigen-specific antibodies with strong responses [in mice] that were valid 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine to be developed as a nasal spray.
Using insect replicators, DNA will be modified to be replicated in human insects to produce small amounts of resistant viruses, which will mimic the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities joined forces to access IBM's supercomputers, combining them with cloud computing services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, called nonspecific effects.
This means they may have benefits after their illness has stopped.
A randomized controlled trial in Australia is expected to recruit 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that vaccines are not safe to use safely and effectively.
Early findings to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19-specific vaccines in animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and primates, have implications for the safety of Level 3 containment measures for the manipulation of live viruses, and international consensus on the use of standard safe methods.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have not been tested in human models.
By 2020, there is no vaccine to eradicate or prevent SARS and to be safely and successfully administered to humans.
Following the review papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development of new vaccines and treatments to control SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is no credible vaccine for MERS.
The MERS outbreak was widely believed that the detection of the recently developed SARS virus could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents for the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has completed Phase I human clinical trials, and three others are underway, all of which are vector-based vaccines, two adenoviral-vector-based (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector-based (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have raised the possibility of a conspiracy that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and a vaccine developed for it.
The patents for the social media posters of the species are referring to previous patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a pandemic infection caused by the respiratory tract virus coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, dry mouth, and stomach pain.
The incubation period for symptoms is usually around five days but can be as long as two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild, but some can lead to inflammation and organ damage.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in the deaths of more than 153,000 people.
More than 568,000 cases have been reported. The virus is mainly transmitted between infected individuals, usually through small pieces of urine released by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
The bitumen from the saliva also forms a respiratory sac, but it usually falls to the ground or the saliva is infected by a nearby spillage.
People can also become infected if they touch contaminated areas and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in the environment for up to 72 hours.
It is most common in the first three days of onset of symptoms, but prevalence may be higher before symptoms appear and in the post-mortem period.The standard diagnostic method involves a reaction to the real-time regression-chain polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in nasal swabs.
The use of face masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
The mandate for the use of masks in public varies, with some authorities refusing to use them, others banning them, and others saying they should be used.
Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.
A prevalence of the disease has been recorded in dozens of countries in all WHO member states.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Symptoms include sudden and sudden respiratory failure, pain in the chest or pressure, loss of consciousness, wakefulness from pain, and a bluish tinge of the face or lips; immediate medical attention should be sought if such symptoms are present.
Minor symptoms, such as shortness of breath, nasal congestion or sore throat may be present.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been reported in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pain and heartburn.
In some cases, the disease can lead to abdominal pain, multiple organ damage, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but ranges from two to 14 days.
97.5% of cases develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The reason for the spread of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, early signs suggest that they are involved in the spread of the disease.
The prevalence of asymptomatic infections is currently unknown and will be studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases are still asymptomatic and hospitalized.
The National Health Commission of China has started classifying asymptomatic cases into one-day cases on 1 April; of the 166 total cases on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The feces and saliva may carry a large amount of the virus.
Strong language is far more effective than normal speech.
A Singaporean study found that a naked snake can take a drop of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences says that bioaerosol dispersal is possible and that airborne corridors outside of public toilets have produced positive samples for the RNA virus.
Other medical procedures such as tubal insertion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory droplets to leak into the air and then explode into the air.
The concern is that it can be spread through eggs, a risk that is accepted at the egg level. The virus is more susceptible to spread if people are symptomatic; however, the risk of transmission can be established before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that it is not known exactly how easily the disease spreads, with one person usually infecting two or three others. The virus can survive for long periods on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus has been found to persist on cardboard for up to a day, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this is the difference between humidity and temperature.
Saws and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products cut through the greasy tissue to protect against the virus, remove it, and remove it from the tissue or other areas.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are more mild.In a Hong Kong study, urine samples were grown within two days of admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed an increased viral load at the end, while the sixth patient had an increased viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated in three cases of tuberculosis in Wuhan.
All strains of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus contain coronaviruses that have been isolated from the environment.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a natural soap, which is then blocked by a human pathogen. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organs to the effects of COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cell via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is predominantly found in the lung alveolar type II cells.
The virus uses a special surface of a glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Serious heart attacks have been reported in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and are common in acute pain.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms increases, due to a systemic inflammatory response to the pain of the immune system during the course of the disease, but damage to the myocardial cortex can also bind to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
An increased incidence of thrombosis (31%) and vascular thromboembolism (25%) has been observed in UTI patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a lower prognosis.The surgical deaths from COVID-19 indicate a diffuse alveolar (AAD) defect, and lymphocyte-like inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is trophic for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In addition, in GM-CSF-producing pathogenic T cells, correlation with IL-6-producing monophyletic recruitment was shown to be associated with inflammatory and painful hepatic pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in the surgery.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method for assessing the test is real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed using breath samples taken from the nose and throat; however, a nasal swab or a breath sample may also be used.
Results are usually known within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and results with little immediate validity.
Chinese researchers were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish the genetic sequence so that international laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (a person can detect active viruses and if a person has had previous infections) was in development, but not yet in widespread use.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first screening test on March 21, 2020 for human use.The diagnostic support team at Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital is considering methods to detect any clinical trials and epidemiological risk.
Multiline opacities of the ground glass on both sides of the peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior divisions are common in the early stages.
Subpleural dominance, flattened pavement (differences in septic lobe swelling and alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Very little data has been released on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main findings of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the spine and pulmonary edema.
Four types of painful bowel movements can be observed:
mild tumors: edema tumors, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nucleated cells of the kidney
severe pain: disruption of the alveolar exudate.
DAD is the source of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
exfoliation: the formation of exudates between the alveolar cavities and the fibrosis of the interstitial spine.
Blood: clotting with intravesicular circulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to prevent and reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
CDC recommendations include covering the mouth and nose with a mask during the diagnosis of acute cases and the use of a hand wrap if the mask is missing.
True hygiene after a diagnosis is urgently needed.
CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, in public places to limit the spread of asymptomatic cases. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce the number of infected people and to close toilets and workplaces, restrict travel and close public places.
The help of the hidden distance also indicates that people stayed about 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known cure for the severe effects of COVID-19.While vaccines are not expected to be completed by 2021, the key to preventing COVID-19 is hopefully to try to reduce the impact of the epidemic, which is referred to as "flattening the curve".
CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for 20 seconds after using the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating, and after rubbing their nose, coughing, and sneezing.
It also recommends the use of 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers, but only when soap and water are not available.In areas where there is a history of purchasing hand sanitizers that are not commercially available, WHO has introduced birth control formulas instead.
In these formulations, the active ingredient is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove the holes in the nail by alcohol; it is "a persistent ingredient in hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added to the mixture.
People are treated with supportive care that may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other injured organs.
The CDC has advised that people who suspect their mother of the virus wear a simple face mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to relieve respiratory distress, but its effectiveness is still being studied.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Support and treatment may be necessary for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of an outbreak.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Committee have issued guidelines for the treatment of people in hospital beds for COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonology in the U.S. have developed treatment options from various agencies and free resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been found.
For symptomatic treatment, some doctors recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the initial attack.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of virus transmission, especially in medical facilities that can emit aerosols such as pipes or hand-blown air.
For health care workers who monitor COVID-19 patients, the CDC has deployed a personal identification box to the Airborne Infection Identification Room (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, contact and ventilation precautions. The CDC has recommended the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended materials to use include: PPE clothing, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical devices. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has already approved the use of all U.S. commercial-use-approved masks.
It is designed to protect the patient from airborne contamination but its presence in the airway is not a guarantee of its effectiveness.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or, in the absence of any, home-made masks.
The overall incidence of COVID-19 is so low that it requires the use of ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases require it.
The type of respiratory support for patients with COVID-19 respiratory infections is being studied extensively for hospitalized patients, with evidence that the tube may be removed by either a high-pressure airway or a secondary positive pressure.
But it is not clear whether either of these two drugs provide the same benefits for people with chronic illnesses.
Some doctors choose an intraocular ventilator if it is necessary to use the technique of preventing the spread of particulate matter in the air by using a nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries lack adequate hospital beds per person, which limits the health system to rapidly responding to the number of COVID-19 cases of a sufficiently high level of hospitalization.
A study in China found that in 5% of people admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% were exposed to ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 hospitalizations end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation has become more complicated due to the pain of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is associated with COVID-19 and the oxygen supply that is becoming more painful.
Ventilators with a pressure-controlled mode and high PEEP are designed to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of liver damage from wind and chest pain.
Strong PEEP may be lacking in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
Although new drugs are available for development as early as 2021, many drugs are currently approved for use in other conditions or are in the early stages of development.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe illnesses.
WHO has also sent volunteers to the trial to test the safety of the pre-treatment equipment. FDA has given short-term approval for survivors' plasma for clinical use in cases where life is considered critical or imminent.
It has not yet undergone clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy in treating disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to try to contain the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app has a history of detecting "faulty contacts" using surveillance data and is in danger of being hacked.
Each employee may also verify the status of three other employees.
If an emergency is detected, the app will not only send a person to quarantine but also notify local health authorities.Extensive mobile sensing, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and medical technology are being used to track contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
These measures were taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may have had contact with vulnerable citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared a mobile phone data center with Germany's federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to detect and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had received a notification from mobile phone operators that "40% of the population is still going to places".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, issued a global call for a high-level strategy to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals will suffer from the disillusionment of quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of the consequences.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, isolation, fear and pain, stress and lack of resources are all factors that are hurting people's lives in their own way".
A mild illness with few symptoms may be as minor as a respiratory infection, such as a common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with more severe symptoms take between three and six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection from any of the viruses that are similar, such as SARS and MERS, but are at higher risk because COVID-19 is absent.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and lungs.
In those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, shock or multiple organ damage.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Adverse blood clots, especially prothrombin-induced increases, have been reported in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, but renal failure has been observed in 4% of the population.
Around 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been shown to have elevated levels of transaminase enzymes.
According to the same report, the median time from onset to onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five of those being hospitalized.
In contrast, patients referred to the ICU had a median time of seven days since hospitalization and death.
In the first case study, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 and 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the prevalence of obesity among men was 2.8% compared to 1.7% among women.
Histopathological examinations of cadaver bone samples indicate the spread of alveoli to fibromyxoid cell exudates of both bones.
Mutations in the cytopathology of the virus were observed in the pneumocytes.
The peephole is similar to the pain of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported to the Chinese National Health Commission, heart failure was associated with elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations were premature.Medical resources and socioeconomic conditions of the disease may affect mortality rates.
Estimates of the number of deaths from the disease vary due to the evolution of the fungus, but also due to the complexity of the methodology.
The measurement of simple cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, since the deaths were caused by previously acquired diseases, the current death rate is likely to be lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to be hospitalized or die compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Directorate has observed a 20% to 30% decrease in liver strength in patients recovering from the disease, and liver scans have shown organ damage.
This can also lead to post-concussion syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the vaccine would provide effective and long-term immunity to survivors.
Immunity appears to be possible, as is the case with other coronavirus, but cases of survivors of COVID-19 were followed up with positive coronavirus tests at a later date than reported.
Such cases are believed to be a reduction in the severity of the disease that is not a threat but not a new threat.
The virus is thought to be endemic and originated in humans, through the spread of infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the virus is estimated to be spread from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, states that the date of the first onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first symptoms began on 8 December 2019.
These multiple months are used to determine the number of deaths.
These dates vary in location and time and depend on the size of the population, the complexity of the health system, the types of treatment, the time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 warning codes of U07.1 for those from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for those from clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.The case-to-case ratio indicates the number of cases divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global infection rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies from country to country. Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die from it, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people who have been infected (diagnosed or undiagnosed) with the disease who die from it.
These statistics are not chronological, but follow a population-specific pattern from the onset of infection to the end of cases.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people may have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have recently died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread from the Carnival celebrations, and affected young children, resulting in a small number of deaths and not all deaths from COVID-19 were classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was notoriously fragile.
In the Netherlands, up to 3% may have antibodies, as assessed by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) are confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The pandemic rates and death rates vary between males and females.
The highest murder rates among males in all studies were in China and Italy.
The risk increases for men in their 50s, and the gender gap closes in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The cause of the differences between males and females is not known, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, low cigarette use in males and increased risk of maternal deaths such as hypertension in adolescents may increase the prevalence among males.
In Europe, 57% of cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not conducted a COVID-19 population census.
Research shows that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
An increasing percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at increased risk for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is for corona, VI is for virus, D is for disease, and 19 is the year the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
Instead of choosing to exclude fingerprinting from a specific geographic area (e.g., China), species or population, a series of international references to the naming convention is thought to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called respiratory fever coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to simply as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the outbreak were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV respiratory infectious diseases as the target names for the virus and disease following the 2015 recommendation for the choice of disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Beyond the standards of the medical device industry, some digital manufacturers are printing hospital equipment such as nasal sprays and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital was in urgent need of a ventilator valve, and its employee could not deliver it at the desired time, a local company reverse engineered and printed 100 of the required valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the pandemic spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans appear to have a history of transmitting the virus to other animals.
The study failed to detect any sign of viral transmission in pigs, ducks, and others.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines has been undertaken by governmental organizations, academic societies and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of the combination antiviral treatment that offers strong hope of cure.
A vaccine has not yet been developed, but several agencies are working to develop acceptable vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoVs was done on the basis that both SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being sought.
First, researchers have proposed the development of a complete vaccine against the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether it is viral or lethal, aims to accelerate the human immune response to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to produce a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to the actual subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this detection focuses on the spicule-S protein that allows the virus to enter the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for improving immunization).
Vaccines tested using these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was initiated with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain the genetic code of the disease not copied from the human pathogen.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been proposed in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 but this is still an open question.
More than 300 clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials are studying approved treatments for malaria, and four are studying hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs have also been developed as part of the overall Chinese study, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir underway in several countries to report by the end of April.
A clinical dynamic review of the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 with a potential vaccine is expected in April 2020.Many antiviral drugs already developed are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Symptoms of remdesivir were first observed in March 2020.
Improved clinical outcomes were observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was originally used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
The chances are that scholars will analyze the findings.
Health authorities in Korea and China have ordered the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when administering one dose of gamma daily, reports that two doses are extremely dangerous and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in clinical trials treating COVID-19 patients.The Chinese 7th edition also added interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir to kill COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are essential for the in vitro control of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been proposed for subsequent in vivo studies following demonstration of low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have suggested that the introduction of the primary protein spectrum using transmembrane serine protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is of critical importance for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have severe limitations that have led the pharmaceutical community to reject therapies without further study. Oseltamivir is not effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be the most severe of the late stage of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-inflammatory properties.Tocilizumab has been added to the treatment suite by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
A phase 2 non-randomized trial is currently underway nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in patients with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test for diagnosis, it is designed to inhibit growth, which is thought to be the leading cause of death in most cases of stroke.
The interleukin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA in a series of studies prior to the development of a different treatment for the cytokine-refractory steroid disorder, CAR T-cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled trial to confirm that tocilizumab is a valid treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and co-concentrated antibodies from the immune system of COVID-19 survivors to those in need is recommended as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
Such a tool has been tried but has not worked.
Neutralization of the virus is the process by which passive antibody therapy is thought to be able to reduce the risk of transmission to SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis may be active.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of machine-made monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The serum concentrations of survivors, which are composed of plasma from survivors and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased to allow for rapid distribution.
Coronavirus, a highly contagious group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a medical doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who was the late COVID-19 test subject died after increasing knowledge of the spread of the virus.
