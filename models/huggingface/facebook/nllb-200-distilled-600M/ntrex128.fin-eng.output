Members of the Welsh House of Representatives are afraid to look stupid.
Some Members of Parliament have been confused by the proposal to change their honour to MWP, or Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea of the House of Representatives was to change its name to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change could make them the object of ridicule.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, the group is concerned that the name rima with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupidity and pwp means shit.
A representative from the Plaid Party said the majority of the group were not satisfied and had proposed other options.
A Conservative Party spokesman said his group was "very pleased" with the name change, but noted that the word MWP is a short word for "stupid".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Delegation, which is currently preparing a legislative change to the name, stated: The final decision on the names of the members of the Delegation is, of course, up to the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the House of Representatives the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, which showed that the appointment of the representative to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
The Commission approved the Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMP, as the honourable Members of the House of Representatives, but the MWP option was the most supported in a public opinion poll.
The House is obviously proposing alternative names, but the lack of consensus could be a headache for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to make the proposed changes within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also includes other amendments to the functioning of the Chamber, such as the rules on the loss of the office and the formation of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, members of the House of Representatives may vote in the final instance on the title they should be addressed.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its northern neighbour's name is in practice a territorial claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership attempts.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that a name change is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
The clocks of St. Martin's are silent as the churches of Harlem go through difficult times.
"The old people I have spoken to say that before there was a bar or a church at every corner", Adams says.
There's no one now.
He said it's understandable that bars are losing.
He said that the way people interact has changed.
Bars are no longer common neighborhood living rooms where people meet regularly.
For churches, he is concerned that the sale of property is not going as far as the leaders imagine, and sooner or later they have returned to the starting line.
He added that churches could be replaced with residences and apartments that people living in are not the kind that would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white", he says, "and thus they will have to spend the day when these churches will shut their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black community - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St. Martin's took over the Black Congregation, led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street in Harlem's central business district against the hiring or promotion of these black people.
In 1939, a fire badly damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's congregation was planning to rebuild, they introduced the tower clock.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, Father David Johnson, proudly called the tower clock the "Clock of the Clock".
The expert who played the tower clock in July called it another name: Cultural Treasure and Incomparable Historical Instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first tower bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins wasn't his replacement.
In recent months, a complex construction company has developed in St. Martins, involving architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Diocese and the church's clergy.
Germany, the governing body of the local church, wrote to the clergy in July expressing concern that the clergy were "trying to move costs" to Germany, even though Germany had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the clergy.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency regarding the leakage.
A shark hit a 13-year-old lobster farmer in California.
Authorities say the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving lobster on the opening day of lobster season in California.
The attack took place on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group of others were waving to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought the boy was only excited when he caught the lobster, but then realized that he was shouting: "Bitted!
I was bitten!'
When Hammel reached the boy, he said he noticed that his entire skeleton had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a fisherman, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a safe species.
Giles added the victim's injuries to his upstairs apartment.
Authorities have closed the beaches of Casablad from Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's is planning to launch a UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging the luxury beauty departments of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with expert advisors.
This is a significant move for the £2.8bn beauty industry in the UK, which continues to grow despite declining sales of fashion and home goods. Larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, expanded to other stores next year.
The investment in beauty products is due to the fact that supermarkets are trying to fill shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's is reporting that its beauty product portfolio will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space and will have their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket is also launching its boutique make-up line again, and in the future, most products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers demand it more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop fragrance chain is testing out rental stores at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The shift from online shopping to small one-time purchases in nearby shops is forcing supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's CEO, has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain battles low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, plus Habitat stores, which the company says has promoted food sales and made profitable purchases.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried to start a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended with a dispute over how to split the profits of supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy follows a corporate sale in which Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesius, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand its range of luxury skincare products to four stores under brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained workers who are ready to advise clients.
Our range of brands caters to all needs and our attractive environment and convenient location make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges traditional shopping practices.
Peter Jones, angry at Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in a rage when TV producer Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's got no time for their home food and housing labels for Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, and she's now planning to focus on her new release deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious at a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlowe, Buckinhamshire.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was accused of doubling Willoughby's estimated £11 million in assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in shock.
No one would have believed Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlowe's head office has a warehouse full of products for sale.
The This Morning host is one of Britain's most profitable stars, and experts say his departure could cost the company millions of dollars in investments, from pillows to candles to clothing to home-cooked items, not to mention a delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby hosted Capp's Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as chairman in March.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being promoted to the new M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said the night before, "We're not commenting on his business".
We had a hard talk and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for comments that some would consider inappropriate for the president and his optimism about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be the voice of a news anchor.
I didn't give up on anything.
He noted Kim's interest in meeting again after Trump had spoken of the first meeting in July as a significant step toward a nuclear arms race with North Korea.
But the nuclear negotiations have broken down.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a response from the United States to North Korea's early actions to counter the threat of assyrification.
He said the United States would instead continue its sanctions, which are meant to keep pressure on the country.
Trump had a much more optimistic view of the situation.
"It's going great with North Korea", he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been freed, and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get out of the hall at this point and get 10,000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, pointing straight at the audience in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, many foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency requiring international assistance was not declared, although about 10 percent of Lombok residents had been left homeless.
In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging, Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a travel group in Palu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
The National Disaster Agency's spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were evaluating Pray's situation to see if international organisations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared for natural forces, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely caused by a missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship to help victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia's outdated infrastructure the focus of his campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of the river has been plagued by financial problems as new elections approach next year.
Some pressures are also fueled by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority has adopted an older form of religion.
Christian and Muslim mobs have fought in the streets with logs, arrows, arrows, and other primitive weapons, killing more than 1,000 people and forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes.
Look at this: Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge has lost a late draw to Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a League Cup defeat on Saturday after a 89-minute draw at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was knocked out by Xherdan Shaqir 27 miles from Chelsea's home ground when his team was in a goal-loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before scaring a shot to the rear.
The gunshot was floating high above the penalty area towards the right upper angle.
Eventually, the ball landed over the Cape Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible up, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after the Belgian Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues hit gave Mateo Kovacic a knockout in the situation before he crashed a run near midfield and was spurred to Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic was playing a fast-paced, wall-to-wall midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a wonderful passing job.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool by shooting Alisson Becker in the left foot in the back.
Liverpool will face off against the Champions League group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play UEFA Europa League on Thursday at Videoton at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a news conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves as high as six meters.
The ruined buildings spread widely to the town of Palun, which had a population of 380,000.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found in Merseyside this morning in Birkenhead has sparked a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Chief Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I urge everyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also urge all, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something on a dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.
A female police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman found dead was from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman came to the scene and asked about her whereabouts.
As the investigation continues, police say they're trying to inform the victim's family of the incident.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
She was speechless when she found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it may be hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene with tears in her eyes.
He repeated his repeatedly saying that it's terrible.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two landings in the isolated area, and a third outside.
There were several police officers guarding the apartment building in the isolated area.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymous number 0800 555 111 using code 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell Palace of Parliament was also part of a history rewrite package.
The expulsion of the priesthood would be poetic, given that his own fanatical Puritan followers destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England, as did the best of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typical" and "a rewrite of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over the removal of the stables would make a painting of Oliver Cromwell's stables in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor executed the iconic classes of the English Civil War.
False Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell reflects 19th-century views and is historical evidence of a character still held by many to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against the external pressure, which was, of course, caused by the monarchy in this case.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th century disputes have shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must identify a figure who represents the other side of that division.
Furthermore, his achievements as a statesman deserve praise and memory.
The time of the killing has killed a Chinese farmer
Local media reports say that a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southern China.
The body of a man identified only by his surname Yuan was found near a pig in Liupanshu Square in Guizhou Province, with a broken collarbone and blood all over him, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pig herd is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was told that he was traveling with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed the door of a nearby fish was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big crow with a mouth full of blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the death of a 250-pound rooster from a farmer's cradle.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said that my daughter's legs were bloody and bruised.
The surveillance footage shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials told the Evening News that the pig had been kept under lock and key so as not to harm others as the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the prosecutors are reportedly in talks about compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig slammed a Welsh farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to make the animal slip through the road.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was forced to eat his pigs. After the incident, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just a game.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing heavy rain to the southern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing flooding to northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 38 meters per second, was at its peak on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. eastern time, about 200 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa reaches the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward toward the southern portion of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
After that, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large rain areas in the south in the coming days.
Local rainfall of 25 to 100 millimeters causes dangerous heavy rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50 to 75 millimeters of rain per hour in certain landing areas, particularly in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the south, especially Arizona, are expected to receive up to 50 to 100 millimeters of rain.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the dispersion of tropical rain.
When threatened by tropical rainfall, it is strongly recommended that you avoid walking into the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms can produce local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rainfall to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimetres is possible, causing small flows of waste and slippery roads.
It's the first rains of the season in the region.
The scattered tropical rainforests begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last for a week on Wednesday.
In October, the United States will see strong fluctuations in temperatures throughout the Arctic as it cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the central United States, there is an excellent example of a large temperature difference on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
The summer's lingering heat will seek to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
Early October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching +26 degrees from the southern to the northeastern parts.
In New York City, temperatures could rise to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast shows that the eastern United States has a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the interview with Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million viewers watched Tuesday's broadcast of six television channels in which Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexual misconduct in the 1980's, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, political stance continued as television companies suspended their broadcasts at the last minute turn, which said the FBI was conducting a week-long investigation into allegations under an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, an overweight man, had been beating him up and tried to strip him at his high school party.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave a sentimental testimony stating that he was one hundred percent sure that this did not happen.
The audience was likely more than Nielsen's 20.4 million reported on Friday.
The company averaged viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the number of viewers who watch in offices.
Some of the scale indicates that the reading is equivalent to the number of viewers at the American football bowl game or the Oscars.
The highest viewership among all television networks was on Fox News Channel, which has been strongly supported by opinion leaders for Kavanaugh's nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Friday night, the drama was centered on Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras captured the screams of protesters accompanying him on the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday, after the backbenches of the Republican Party of Malta had previously announced he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed him live, standing on a minute stand, staring down at the lowest flights.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you believe he's telling the truth to the people?
"You have power, with so many women powerless", she was told.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added that before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee began voting to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the Senate.
However, Flake said he was only acting on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by discussions he had with his friend, the Democratic actor Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was a power struggle because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused in an interview with the Sunday Times of criticizing her plans to leave the EU of political activities that threaten Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
The first is that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on the basis of the Commission's proposal to extend the tariff quota to the third Member State, which is the country which has the right to apply the tariff quota to the third Member State.
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing an LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who was playing basketball at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and taken to a county jail, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the Sims and Simpson interviews where police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, WAFB reports.
Police say Simpson admitted to the shooting in the wake of the investigation.
According to Advocate, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's Director of Sports, thanked law enforcement for their transparency and for the implementation of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-two forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was shocked and saddened by Wayden's death.
"You're always afraid something like this is going to happen", Wayde said.
A volcano spits ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the Mexico City Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater's activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash fires were recorded in 24 hours.
The center records the vibration and vibration several times.
Social media has published images showing a thin layer of ash covered in windshields in residential areas such as Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers south of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists are taking together before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday in clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing protests on the first anniversary of the vote to dissolve the parliament.
Police held a group of masked independence activists who threw police with eggs and powdered mildew, which formed dark dust clouds on the normally tourist-filled streets.
As the day progressed, more cocoa was being produced as the police used their pumpkins to control spears.
The clashes between the pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former calling for 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness' and the latter for 'the survival of Spain'.
Local media reports say 14 people have been treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions remain in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was a small difference from boycotting the opposition.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night outside on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest was organized, however, but it had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we're stuck in our seats, he says.
Despite the huge but vital victory in the regional elections in December, the momentum of the pro-independence parties in Catalonia has slowed this year, with many of the most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who photographed a pro-police protest on her phone, says politicians on both sides of the fence are fighting.
"The situation is getting worse and worse", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders on the probe since last year, announced his participation in next year's European Parliament elections.
To run for the euro is the best way to condemn the crushing and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government, he says.
Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after reports of a car repeatedly colliding with a house in Londonderry.
The incidents took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Chief Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A car could have been shot at some point with a razor blade.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 on a home run to Menga .
Dolly Menga 's first goal at Livingston confirmed the win .
Livingston surprised the Rangers in the series and only caused Steven Gerrard to lose his second 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to second place, shared with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team missed out on their first ever Premier League win of the season, and next Sunday they will face head coach Hearts, who are eight points ahead.
The Rangers are still in the midst of a Rapid Vienna European League game on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued to be undefeated in the series for six straight games, and head coach Holt has yet to lose a single game after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his seat to a visitor suffering from a lack of a blade.
Holt should have led the team long before he was painted, having caused Rangers terrible trouble with his straight.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and Alan Lithgow was able to slip through the goal line to Craig Halkett's shot, but he passed the ball.
The hosts gave up the ball to the Rangers, knowing they could vaccinate against special circumstances.
The important goal came this way.
The Rangers caused Livingston a free-kick, which allowed Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play Meng for a spot where he could move the ball into the middle of the penalty area and finish.
Rangers had held the ball by then, but claiming home team defense held the ball, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely got a chance to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's bid and Lithgow passed the ball in one more special Livingston incident.
The rain centers for Livingston's penalty area were constantly being wiped out, and two cases involving unnecessary punishment were called for -- Halkett's struggling substitute Glenn Middleton and the ball in his hand.
- Good performance from Livingston. - Analysis.
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
That's a great performance and a great result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent from each player, continuing through the ascents.
The team's gameplay and crew have not changed much since it returned to the top tier.However, the Holt must be recognised for the way he has strengthened the team after arriving.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a formidable leader in a highly organized defense, with Mengan holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers were lacking in ideas.
The team has performed very well under Gerrard at times, but it has now fallen far short of his modest level.
The last pitch was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the middle of the playoffs.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which is a controversial one, and the purpose of the trip is to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and press freedom as well as on Turkey's efforts to join the EU.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, citing security concerns, but many supporters gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to invite him into the country.
The competing protests reflect a split in opinion, with some German Turks hailing him as a hero while others slander him for autonomy.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in Deptford's south side near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver of the car stopped and medical personnel came to the victim's rescue, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the scene on Saturday.
City police say they're trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and buses are diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
Prison officials report six prison guards were injured in a high-security prison riot.
The riots began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 on Sunday and continue.
Tornado Special Forces have been deployed to calm the unrest, which is being followed by eight inmates in one prison cell.
A minor police face injury was treated at the scene.
A prison administration official said that a specialised prison guard has been sent to HMP Long Lartin to handle the situation.
Six of the staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and may have to spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prison warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October, the prison was alerted to police officers for serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought zones may benefit)
Tropical low-pressure airspace rarely reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's happening early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert, bringing with it the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued a severe rain warning Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosas are expected to make their way directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving in the form of rainfall on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only 10 tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 65 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecasts 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with up to 150 millimeters of rain per area in Mogollin Hills, Arizona.
In other areas of the southern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, the actual rainfall is 25 to 50 milliliters, with a total of up to 100 millimeters.
Rosé rains can also be a blessing in experiencing drought in an area where there is no risk of heavy rainfall.
While flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall can be beneficial, as the southern region has suffered severe drought.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will make its first landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa, located about 200 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, is still the strongest hurricane ever to hit the country, with winds of 135 miles per hour, and is moving northward at 20 miles per hour.
The storm loses its strength when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico during a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rains can cause significant flooding.
75 to 150 millimeters from the California peninsula in northwestern Sonora are expected, with up to 250 millimeters possible, reports weather.com.
Rosa then continues its journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning, from where it continues its journey through southern Arizona to Utah late Tuesday.
The greatest risks to Rosa or its remnants have been associated with very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the US Midwest, reports the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning, British time.
He was taken to the hospital where he is reported to be in stable condition.
Police say they arrested a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset overnight.
Police are requesting contact from anyone who may have video footage of the incident on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the anger and anger of the Democratic Party.
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's unbridled and shameful methods", Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered from the silliness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage on that day.
"My vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is a vote for one of the most deserving jurists of our time, with excellent public service credentials", he told his West Virginia fan club.
The President made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I didn't just campaign, I campaigned full-time, he said.
That's why I'm going round and round to fight for the best candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats took the task of "resisting and preventing".
A senior aide to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process is expected in the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people died on Saturday in a major earthquake and tsunami on Sulawes Island in Indonesia, many of whom were wiped out by the massive waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the town of Palun on Friday, when waves as high as six meters hit the beach in the evening storm, many drowning to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami caused 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still roaming the beach and did not immediately escape, leaving them as victims, reports Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Relief Agency in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, but it dragged cars, logs, houses and struck all over the country, says Nugroho.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palus.
The disaster agency's air photos show several destroyed homes and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent earthquakes continued to ravage the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's BPPT, the agency for the assessment and application of technology, issued an opinion that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the countryside of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have caused a tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "a devastation" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of the ruined buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater than Palus, 300 kilometers north of the continuing coastline in the Donggala region, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication links are completely disrupted and no information has been received from Donggala, says Nugroho.
The statement by the Red Cross said that over 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", he said.
The Bureau was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami that hit Pallu, although officials said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is vigorously shouting warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a waterfall hits the beach, taking buildings and cars on their way.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the footage at the time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that cut off communications around Palun, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities in transportation vehicles, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres of the Praju on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami has killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
World Vision Donggala staff have been safely evacuated to Palun, where they are housed in tent-like sheds in the office's courtyard, and on their way they have bypassed the scene of the destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he says.
It's really bad.
As aid groups began their discouraging mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only begin to flow after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can start receiving international assistance, but no declaration has yet been made.
As the second night fell on Pray after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would be spared the dark tale of natural disasters by the miracle trade.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian relay team, had trained two missing relayers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi says.
"As a parent of an addict, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
Gendon says he tried desperately to reach the Prau competitors at the beach festival via WhatsApp after news of the Roa Roa Hotel's downfall spread to the hanging community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
It means that I understand that the messages were not delivered, he says.
Thieves took $26,750 from a bank ATM filling in in Newport on the Levine.
On Friday morning, thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security guard while he was completing a bank ATM at Newport on the Levine, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been clearing and completing a bank ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When the Brink's employee was out of the loop, he was chased by a man who also stole the money he was supposed to deliver.
Witnesses said they saw several people flee the scene, but police did not specify their numbers.
Any person with any information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changing his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "A character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been West's favourite name for some time, and she also used it as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, has withdrawn from the show for "hourly reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has religious significance to him, in addition to being short for his professional name.
In a discussion about the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said that he believed ye to be the most common word in the Bible, and that there it means sin.
So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kany, which means unique, and ended with the short form Ye, which just expresses the goodness, the badness, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are.
He's one of several well-known rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his favourite names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner JAY-Z has also occasionally deleted and restored the link and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico agrees not to use the military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country approached the 50th anniversary of student retaliation.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at the Plaza de Tlatelolco on Saturday, promised never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, armed forces launched a peaceful protest, killing up to 300 people as left-wing student movements spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly tuition and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The EU should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its funding for AI research as China increases its activity in the field, says AI scientist and financier Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by the announcements of various parts of the US administration on artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China already announced its plan last year: it aims to become the leading AI developer by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month through Houghton Mifflin's Harcourt publishing house.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest rated Othello player in the United States.
Lee acknowledged the US administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says the American researchers have been working hard to get public funding.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, they are taken by big companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited top college students to work with AI in recent years.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the United States to increase its AI efforts.
I think that those who have completed a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically granted green cards, he said.
The Commission also examined the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House has also announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF, for its part, invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has hampered its bid for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, considers that its northern neighbour's name is in practice a territorial claim to its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The governments of the countries signed a new draft agreement in June, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and that the campaign against the vote raises doubts about whether voting activity will reach the 50% required to get a legitimate result.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you for NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of a name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying for Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to be able to seek membership in both the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported as of 1 p.m.
However, the voting rate was only 16 compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of those eligible voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital city of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change opened the way for NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and put the referendum chairs in front of the tents of boycotting protesters in front of the Parliament in Skopje.
We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join up, not through the kitchen door, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us to Macedonia, we can turn to another way, as China and Russia have done in the context of the euro integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the investment needed to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the "no" voice is our "bright" future.
A poll by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters were active in the referendum - less than the required level.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be successful, voting activity must exceed 50% with one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City 's Sergio Aguero has scored his first goal against the entire defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear their mark on Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the 65-minute goal seem ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the top Argentine player was knocked out of the midfield.
He found an empty space on the pitch by running through the throats of three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he found Sterling, delivering the ball to his left.
The Englishman used his first touch inside the penalty area to return the ball to Aguer, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's goal with a right-handed shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero has problems with his legs.
We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time.
Sterling, however, had already given the heavenly women an advantage in the League of Nations.
The paint came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the middle of the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy San a beautiful passing job on the left side.
Sane made a few touches before he sent the ball to the rear of the ball, heading for Sterling.
A celestial attacker threw the ball into the net just before the main line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in the game against the Rockies .
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why try hard to make the starting lineup?
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take over the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a losing record, one win behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies have at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division win.
While we have no stake in this, we can at least get up to speed knowing that the public and the second team's downer atmosphere here in Denver is creating the most challenging competitive environment I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?
The Nationals have yet to release their newest starting quarterback on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under the circumstances.
Scherzer threw out a practice session Thursday, he'd start the game at 34, and he'd feed on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
The right-hander from Washington has an 18-7 win-loss record this season, a 2.53 ERA, and he's hit 300 home runs with 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is running for office in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court justice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while also discussing the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full-time, and that's why I'm going around to fight for the best candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their wickedness and their wickedness.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to beat to get power.
He said the Democrats were taking the task of resisting and preventing.
And it has been evident over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "hateful and mean and mean and mean and lying".
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the most influential Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience responded with loud applause.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, uh, no, I'll wait a minute. It was really bad body language. The worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It doesn't tolerate those who say their opinion.
I was not surprised, in fact, when the activists of my local Momentum party advocated a no-confidence motion against me.
I'm the last one in line to be told I'm not welcome just because we're saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the phrase "disbelief" was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used by the Member States.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly said on Friday that we wanted our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday meetings of the Party Council have been just that.
Many meetings do not now follow that tone, and a more friendly and more moderate policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer has any disagreements and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is appropriate for the leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who thought I shared a similar political view began to expect me to make a complete change and take positions that I would never have otherwise taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a barrage of insults on social media, demanding that I withdraw my vote, reject central politics, and I get to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am indeed happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are at least politically motivated.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day and never give up.
The normalization of torture is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this age.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party of differing opinions, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more limited.
For two years I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything will go well.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the Thatcher government's failure to provide a single school, I have been working as a city councillor and minister to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has ever been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not see the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Nottingham East.
Ayr - Melrose 38-17 , undefeated Ayr in the block
The last two minutes of the match slightly distorted the outcome, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a day's victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership.
Ayr is now the only team out of 10 not to have lost a single match.
After all, excellent defense and more successful risk-taking were what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with that for good reason.
"We've been challenged in our matches and yet we're unbeaten, so I can be happy". he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took the risk better than us".
Ayr took the lead with 14 minutes to go with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Clima's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Roy Hughes, the Scottish captain who gave up the Warriors to the match, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead to a penalty kick, and just before halftime he scored a goal and made the conversion kick, raising Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well with a Patrick Anderson goal, which Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
The game was delayed by a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and taken off the field, and Ayr continued to improve his lead with a goal from Stafford McDowall, which Climo managed in his conversion kick.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was awarded a yellow card, after which Bruce Colvine of Melrose scored a goal after a hard pressure, which the conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climon, and Macpherson scored a goal from the sideline by coming off Ayr's mound.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick the same way he had before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and led Gregor Henry to finish fifth on the home team.
Still Game star is starting out in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company, and is now starting to work in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's highly-rated show, which he co-wrote with comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The Twins have announced that the upcoming ninth season is the series' final, and it appears Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he has been registered as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea is ours: the inland country of Bolivia is trying to regain access to the Pacific Ocean in a legitimate way
The Marines were patrolling outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flags of public buildings are lit by a sea-based flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are being haunted by the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to get it back.
Inland Bolivia still remembers Chile's loss of the coastline in the bloody 19th-century resource war, as does the longing to sail the Pacific once again.
Hopes are high for decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, a shared spirit and a spirit of solidarity, and of course a positive attitude towards the final solution, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country are following the International Court of Justice's decision in the big screens, hoping that Bolivia's position on Chile's obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea will be supported by the conclusion of decades of uninterrupted debate in The Hague.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, has a lot at stake next Monday.
The return to the Pacific is very close, he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's best interest and that even if it did, the situation would be little changed.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to cede the administrative areas of Chile and the ICJ has stated that it will not decide whether to terminate any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes only six months after the final decisions suggest that the case is not complicated, says Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
The current Bolivian government has abolished the issue of maritime connectivity, said Zárate.
He said that the rhetoric challenging the moral argument has stifled the goodwill of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
There have been no second embassies in either country since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, disagrees with the view that the Court's decision would have been exceptionally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have the opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit.
Mr Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time to move on from the past.
North Korea has announced that a nuclear strike will not take place unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-launching impasse diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "long-term dream" to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang takes any significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is cautious about adopting the declaration.
And Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want another summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is going to abandon its arsenal, which the state likely sees as the only real way to ensure its own security, has been widely questioned.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show will feature the latest model's large headgear, which will soon be on your street too.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a display of their SS19 model with a selection of unique oversized headgear that would dazzle the Paris Fashion Week circles.
Extremely impractical headlines have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking design was a beige hat with a wide feather blade that covered the heads of the models almost entirely.
Other luxurious items included jewelry-decorated watercolor, witch hat, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of different masks  just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than fashions.
One creature, with a snorkel and mask, looked more like a diving machine, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion fans predict that giant skins are about to appear on the street.
The oversized hats closely follow La Bombaa, a half-metre-high shoulder hat seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the impractical hat, which has been widely seen on social media, has also transformed another large creation into a fashion showcase of a beach cat made of  oil, almost as large as the model that wears it.
The most eye-catching design of the sculpture was Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week, a burnt orange raffle bag with white leather handles lined with a clay frame.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm seeing big hats and beach bags on the street next summer. Designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for big-size furniture".
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the world's population
The success of the Scottish private schools has traditionally been good, and continued in 2018 as a result of good test results, reinforced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools, with over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Authority (SCIS), aim to provide a high level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for their chosen careers, for postgraduate and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an education operator capable of designing and implementing tailored learning content, we have seen the place of languages as a recommended and desirable continuing learning material in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, the message goes to their head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message reaches his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we are to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of students who pass through private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that 72% of the students with the highest A score studied Mandarin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language learning as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently subjects of free choice, but they are treated as subjects of science (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
The UK Employment Agency survey in 2014 found that 17% of situations where employers had difficulty finding the right employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more essential for promoting the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for any job, the more relevant these skills become in a global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he or she will have a future advantage in this lifelong skill regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a language proficient person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of the more than 4,000 adults in the UK cannot communicate in a foreign language, and French was the only language that 15% of the population spoke in double digits.
That is why it is important for today's children to make a commitment to language learning.
Especially in developing countries, knowledge of languages gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are expected to be important to the Isobritans in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there are always a number of language options available in private schools taught by specialised teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equipps them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At this time, it is not to be denied that languages in the international business environment continue to be of great importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to provide this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of education for young people in Scotland.
It's called bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Schools' Board of Governors, SCIS.
LeBron is making his debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans waiting for LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers are about to pass.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Denver Nuggets Sunday in San Diego in a preseason game.
But how many minutes he really plays, it's up to us.
It's going to be more than one, and less than 48", Walton Lakers official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the wrong minutes.
James, who was training, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare", he said.
Time of the Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump elections planned for next week, including sympathetic targets like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting a vote to elect him to fill the vacant seat of a Supreme Court justice, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing their majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's campaign in West Virginia today, and how do you see it online?
The Trump West Virginia Wheeling event is set to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia online as a live stream on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is taking a stand this week for the Supreme Court's nomination to hear Brett Kavanaugh, who became a hotbed of sexual harassment allegations that delayed the Senate's confirmation vote for more than a week on the charges brought by the FBI's investigation.
But the primary goal of the campaign is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the tight November election.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign commented that the purpose of these five events over the next week is to "awaken the willing and pro-Republicans to protect and expand the Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Rule of Congress is so important to his cause that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during the hectic campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's venue is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and fans can come from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who has been left behind in the polls.
"For Mr Morrissey, there is no good sign that the president is trying to increase his support for opinion polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show signs of battle to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles match
After three one-way sessions, the four games Saturday afternoon were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-reinforcing power of success is a perfectly invented phenomenon in sports, players believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force with them right now?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we're taking this as a leap forward", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a lead: four points ahead and 12 points behind.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little bit of wind in their sails and a lot of encouragement, like the way Spieth and Justin Thomas played all day and got three out of four.
Spieth has been a great leader from brick to green, leading by example.
The winning party's throbbing throats intensified as he advanced the lap as he managed to tie the game to a tie-four, with Thomas and him two points behind after two holes.
The pitch they won in Game 15 was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed the U.S. team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only take care of your own game", Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's peculiar but sweet duo has won four out of four without a single mistake.
Moliwood was the only duo that didn't do any bogie on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this buzzing crowd, confirms that they are Sunday's pre-game fans, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no more popular player in Europe to secure a possible win than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both at the same time in different holes.
The European success story is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was paired with Alex Noren, the hero of the morning game.
One bogi and two double bogies in the first nine holes drilled the Spanish and Swedish so deep that they were nowhere near surviving.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-ball are fascinating to watch from a couple's cooperation perspective: what kind of advice they give or leave out, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the final day, but this quarter showed that the United States has a battlefield, although it is suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a good lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in four balls and four games on Saturday.
The great twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning streak with two wins from the rugged Tiger Woods, and they've gotten a four-point lead today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who struggled to keep their win two years ago at Hazeltin, led the fearsome U.S. team to a 3-1 lead in the morning four-ball water game.
The United States were the strongest opponent in four games, winning two, but they failed to narrow the lead.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points at 12 in the second game on Sunday to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, also known as Molliwood, were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games after a sensational weekend.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then finished overwhelmingly disappointed Woods and American entrepreneur Bryson Dechambeau even harder 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-ball, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson for the quarterfinals, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the standings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this lavish and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Three-time defending champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high score for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won the match 2-1 to Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-final, and later won 4-3 to Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarter-final, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team moved from a four-point lead to a level at the start of a double, although a tie on Fury's side is enough to keep the win.
However, after two days as the second best, it may be that the Sunday counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea will not disarm itself without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances there was no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to increase its nuclear weapons or technology.
"We have never seen a similar situation in the United States", he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of national security, so in such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri repeated the familiar complaint that Washington does not approve of a phased nuclear disarmament where North Korea would be rewarded for every interim effort, his statement is noteworthy in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to the consensus statement delivered by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the sitting US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has demanded the first withdrawal of nuclear weapons and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through violence, even in opposition to the peace declaration, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a wish of indifference.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention any plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: 'If the disarmament party were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to this level.'
But Rin's tone was significantly different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that directing missiles against the continental United States was inevitable after the wrong President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
As early as last year, Trump threatened to completely destroy North Korea, but this year Trump flattered Kim for his courage in approaching disarmament, but he stressed that much work was still left and that sanctions would continue as long as North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strongly and unfailingly until we can prove a complete, definitive and confirmed renunciation of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to impede the financing channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear weapons in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with North Korea during the UN General Assembly and also announced that he would be visiting Pyongyang again next month for the preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit has not gone smoothly.
After leaving Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompey's gangster demands only hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear plant at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event of the United States taking appropriate measures.
Mr Pompeo said Kim was referring to the security guarantees Trump pledged at the Singapore meeting and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on adequate rest.
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are taking a course this year designed to increase student rest, a counterattack to the University's thriving Macho culture of students who spend long nights weightless on caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the world's best universities are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
Designed by Harvard Medical School professor Charles Czeisler, who works on a dream study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the course is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler came up with the idea for the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I not hearing about it until now, in my final year of school?'
No one had ever told her about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising, she told the Telegraph in an interview.
This year's course, which is being held for the first time, will teach students how proper uniting habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine and vice president for university health services at Harvard University, says the university ended the course after hearing about students suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section presents a picture of a living room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep on sports and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second part, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive images, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,' adds Professor Czeisler.
Professor Czeisler says that night-long school marathons are still a source of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting adequate and quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a hunger-like condition in the brain that keeps people hungry, the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical psychology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he had attended one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He tells us that the course opened his eyes and gave him the incentive to organize a course that would cover all students on campus.
He hopes that all graduate students will be able to complete the same level of education before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set a wake-up time to remind them of the sleep time in addition to waking up in the morning and to keep in mind the adverse effects of electrical screens and LED lighting on daytime rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga shooting took the victory from Gerrard 's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were seeking their first win since the 4-1 win against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side won this time, and Gerrard was now suffering only their second defeat in 18 games in his manager's career.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' downed streak has not been a leveling-up since.
The Rangers fell to sixth place in the final, while Livingston has climbed to third place, with only Hibernian leading the scoring.
The Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured in a game when a stranger's eye object hit his head and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the squad that had defeated Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 that the team scored from Hearts last week, and the same strategy again yielded results, with a well-structured lineup managing to punish the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the ball in the possession, Livingston was better off using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score as early as two minutes after Menga's first inning gave Scott Pittman a free kick for Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then managed his free agent Craig Halkett, but second baseman Alan Lithgow only managed to hit a wide rear end.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but the final third of the game left them feeling unconfident.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment after he and Steven Lawless collided at 15 minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed to attempt only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly refused without bothering to take the shot at Lassana Coulibaly and the powerless shot at Ovie Ejari.
Livingston's 34-minute goal was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just a result of the team's hard work.
The Rangers couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long-running feed tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly gave the ball to Meng for an easy painting.
As a substitute, Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and field Ryan Kent, a move that affected the game almost immediately, as Kent made a suitable opening for Morelos, but the attack interrupted Kelly's effective fast defense.
Livingston had the visitors play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued their long runs behind each other.
Holt's team had a chance to improve their lead at the last moments of the game, but McGregor's excellent defense blocked Jacobs' plans before Lithgow could get to his corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers rep, also demanded a penalty kick after taking a fight with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Geigermeter invented by Almanac
The following page from our Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science and a central concept in pop culture, as well as a good example of the 1950 film The Clock of the Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portrayed highly influential scientists:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a geigerometer, and it's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.
Evans: "Stop, now it's really going to work!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and destroy malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to see proteins typical of several cancers.
The trial has shown promising results in various cancer patients.
For example, cancer cells in an ovarian cancer patient disappeared within 18 months of receiving a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory to detect HER2 proteins typical of several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Our results show that this is a very promising vaccine.
HER2 is responsible for the growth of several cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky. These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach  taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells  has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was the target of a lot of criticism after he was hailed by Trump on Saturday Night Live wearing a campaign hat.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West received a neck-clap on Saturday Night Live after he lavishly praised President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for president in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song tonight, "Ghost Town", West, a fanatic of Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"On one occasion, when I was talking to a white man, they asked me how I could support Trump because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he says.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh for a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was held in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's fasting was not shown live, but comedian Chris Rock posted a clip on social media.
It's unclear if Rock intended to mock West with his mail.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been treated unfairly because of his hat in the back of his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on my head.
I'm being bullied!
Then they'll say I'm on the margins, West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says that he's wearing the Iron Man suit because "at that time you can't dictate what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try with love.
According to Variety, West's comments scored at least two public upsets, and the show's performers looked embarrassed.
West was selected to the show on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion among many viewers by performing the song I love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised her courage on Twitter: "THE WITNESS OF THE ROSS OF WITNESS".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just herself, which is absolutely wonderful.
I can, however, decide to be a REAL person (by buying this music or this label or supporting this art) who I consider to be a supporter and propagator of an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us, he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter before his performance that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
West isn't the first artist to change his name, and the musician here is followed by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and later to the artist formerly known as Prince.
A Belfast restaurant snitch is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to police.
The defendant is expected in Belfast court on Monday.
The prosecution will be investigated by the Attorney General's Office.
The cast of the Game of Thrones , Kit Harington , is attacking a toxic masculinity .
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Harrington has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: According to the 31-year-old actor, such roles make young boys feel that they deserve respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural site, Harrington suspects that something has gone wrong in the case and questions the means available to address the toxic masculinity of the #MeToo era.
Harrington, also recently married to Rose Leslie, 31, a star guard at the Game of Thrones, admits that he has a strong desire to address the issue.
"The question of where we went wrong with masculinity is raising strong feelings in me right now", he says.
What have men been taught over the years that has led to the problems now evident?
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: 'What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time. How can we change this?
After all, there is something very bad about young men.
In an interview, he also admits that he will not be involved in the production of the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, because he has, in his own words, had enough of the battlefields and the horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his future wife, Rose, was the best thing Game of Thrones has ever offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so it kind of gave me my future family and my life from then on", he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections in China increased by 14%
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the health authorities, the virus is affecting the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
The Commission has also established that the Commission has not yet adopted a new report on the number of new cases in the Union.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Many marital feelings are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the information of a Republican senator who leaked the employee and accuses him of spreading dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied on Saturday claims that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about them.
A Democrat representative from Los Angeles assured that right-wing commentators and websites were spreading the claims.
Lies, lies and more degrading lies, Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The information released includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.
An unknown person released the information Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the Status of Women, which dealt with allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to Hill, the messages were published from an IP address linked to Waters' office and a member of Waters' staff.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie, Water continued.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is not liable in any way for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters' statement quickly gained criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile", wrote Fleischer.
It seems that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, there is no reason for him to act hostile.
There's no reason to be risky.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In this situation, you must behave in moderation and calm.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters' seat in the midterm congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe this is true", he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said that it had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies following these fraudulent allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, he continued,and that they are held legally liable for any or all destructive and dangerous acts against members of my staff.
Johnny English is hitting the under-performing agent parody of Rowan Atkinson again.
It is already a well-established tradition to look for references to Brexit from any film with a slightly British feel to it, but this does not seem to fit the Johnny English parody of agents and action comedy series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English Reborn.
Can the satire of a nation made in the cheek become Britain's new national export success?
So, this or that, the jackass, the rubber-haired, the incompetent Johnny English has earned his license to do it again and again, and his name is above all indicative of the comic creation that is aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It's, of course, about a dirty secret agent desperately trying to breathe glamour that melts around him, but it turns out to be a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Beani, and the unfortunate one-note musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious worldman whose back is in a silky chaos, originally portrayed by Atkinson in now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard.
The last show has its moments.
I particularly liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the routers stack his helmet.
Atkins' physical comedy talents are coming to light, but the humor itself seems to be underutilized and oddly unnecessary, especially since the established film brands like 007 and Danger Mission now offer humor as a core part of the film's content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and the crazy treatment of Johnny English seems to me to be not as imaginative and sharp-eyed as the comedy of Atkins's Mr. Bean silent roles.
The starting point, repeated every year, is that Britain is in worse trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground to the surprise of an agent on duty, which is portrayed as Kevin Eldon's unfortunate small role.
This is the final straw for the prominent and overwhelming prime minister who is already ear to ear in favour of political dissent: Emma Thompson is doing her best in the shoes of the Teresa May parody, but the script just doesn't give her enough room.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, he must immediately call someone who has already moved away from active duty.
This is, of course, a sentimental Johnny English in his own person, who spends his retirement as a high school teacher, but who also teaches informal courses in the fine art of espionage, which is a subject that carries some clever jokes; English takes the School of Rock-style classes to the brink of intelligence.
English is sent to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endlessly patient fighter buddy Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to be getting her rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to His Majesty's secret service to face the fateful super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, played by Jake Lackey, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately turns into a farce: a pair of waiters disguised as waiters set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos while secretly trying to steal the luxury yacht of the Volta.
Even the last of the filmmakers' obstacles crumble to the finish line, but despite all the outrage and charm, the film still feels a little childish.
You can keep the movie moderate.
I've been watching Johnny English movies before and I've come up with the same question: Why can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Labour in Britain has rejected plans for a four-day workweek with five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that would allow British workers to work four days a week but pay five days.
The party is reportedly demanding that business leaders transfer the savings of the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of extra days off.
The plan says that employees could enjoy three days of weekends on the same paycheck.
The sources said the idea was to align with the party's economic programme and its plans to shift policy towards the workers' welfare.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports the shift to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "I was reporting on the census before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but the four-day workweek is an objective that is consistent with the Party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the UK Green Party has pledged to support a shift to a four-day work week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
The aim is not, however, to be supported indiscriminately in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The current working week is not the party line and the party is not considering a change.
The shadow government's finance minister, John McDonnell, used a working conference last week to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the unsuccessful dictators and the makers of public enterprises.
The shadow government's finance minister plans that the current shareholders of the water companies will not be able to recover their shares in full because the Labour government could implement the reductions on the basis of the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to the company's board and to set up an inclusive ownership fund to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employees, with an annual payment of up to £500 per employee in instalments.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are on the 60-minute program discussing whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation into the charges against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote to appoint Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could disrupt the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's nomination.
During the 60-minute episode broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out things that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open about his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I said on my way to the hearing... I said I'd discussed it with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the charges came out, and I asked him if you were.
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone's throw.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it, Graham added Christine Blasey Ford, referring to her.
None of the people he named could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to alleviate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which will be held in New York City on Saturday, is a music event whose performing arts are as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the meadows of Central Park in New York City to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the event's real goal: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are unwilling to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or activities such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing any other activity that raises awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that it has 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert ticket a real way to get people to act, or is it just one of many clicktivism ideas that the world can be changed by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has published over 19 million workshops on various goals since 2011.
It said that these actions have encouraged policy makers to announce commitments and principles worth more than $37 billion and that they have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements that have already raised or spent more than $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to helping children develop to their full potential. The group pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country, following 4,700 tweets sent to them by activists following the Global Citizen campaign.
Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and people like you, we can put the history of social injustice and malnutrition in the newspaper, Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told audiences at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also called on the UK Government to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 actions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the movement's website is: Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen's answer: The road is going to be long and hard and we have many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are leading the movement for this year's New York concert, and its star guards include artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe.
According to the US Department of the Interior, the country could make energy exports more difficult by using the navy as a liability.
According to the Washington Examiner, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink, Washington can rely on its navy if needed to prevent the spread of Russian energy to global markets, including nearby ones.
Zinc claims that Russia's actions in Syria  the invitation of the legitimate government  are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
I believe that the reason for [Russia's] presence in the Middle East is to transfer energy, just like in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe, Zink is reported to have said.
The Authority has stated that there are methods and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep the sea lanes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by islanding, to ensure that the energy it provides does not end up on the world market", he says.
Zinc spoke to the audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers' Association, a nonprofit group that profiles energy consumers as the voice of the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are one and the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less a feud and a substitution for fuel for another, he says, describing Russia as a circus number of one-trick, fossil fuel-based economy.
The announcements come at a time when the Trump administration has sought to increase the volume of liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace it with a much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To strengthen this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "non-conforming" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says ties Berlin to Moscow's economic pipeline.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of pipeline in operation, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is purely economic and sees it as an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose their supplier", says Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has provoked a backlash in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organization in the country, the German Industrial Union, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel very troubled that a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Union, recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, is planning to consider running for President in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she was "carefully seeking" to run for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination at an open hearing in Holyock, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our corrupt administration, and that also means a woman in the top of the world", she told The Hill.
After the sixth day of November, I will consider running for President carefully.
Warren criticized President Donald Trump on the occasion, saying he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren has appeared as a direct witness in his criticism of Trump and this Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, according to a poll published Thursday, a majority of Warren's constituents do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk University Institute for Policy Research and the Boston Globe, 58% of the likely voters in Massachusetts are against running for senator.
32% voted in favour of the nomination.
The majority of respondents voted in favour of the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% voted against it.
Other top Democratic nominees in the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially end his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin is referring to her son's war wounds at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"From what my own son is going through when he comes home, I can feel very much like other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers are going to bear", he told a crowd gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for Donald Trump's election.
Palin called the arrest a "flood of life" in the living room, and said that his son, like other war veterans, would return home slightly changed, they would return hardened, they would return to consider whether he and his fellow army and air force members would be respected for what they have done for this country.
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman for Wasilla, and charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking an amendment to the new guideline in the United States that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia have left a letter to the Friends of the Law in Washington on Friday, supporting asylum seekers who violate the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal line.
She tells that her partner and her violent gang members abused her and that the U.S. authorities denied her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The Attorney General, who supported Gracea, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. asylum seekers are from, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal for Asylum Claims that undocumented migrants may have applied for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
The District Attorney for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, commented in his statement on Friday that the new line ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case, and this obstacle violates this principle, says the Friends of the Law.
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice of barring asylum seekers from entering the United States is damaging the U.S. economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and create the necessary additional workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges dealing with immigration matters to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is for persons fleeing their home countries because of persecution or fear of being persecuted or persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion Sessions announced the new asylum practice in its opinion of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems  even the serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate survivors are rescuing . The number of deaths in the fire has already doubled .
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The situation is very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while calming her baby's fever at the evacuation center in the ruined town of Palun.
Ambulances are bringing in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their waste and try to save what remains.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fractured spine and shoulder, are resting outside the Palun Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, severe aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he relates how a violent earthquake ravaged the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the crushes between the ruins of the wall, I thought. Harris, according to the Associated Press, said he was in town with his family as a wedding guest.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "provoking" propaganda
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid attachment to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to meddle in the US election mark a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to issue notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an ever-scaling trade war in which both sides are charging tariffs on each other's export products.
Chinese and American experts say that at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese retaliatory tariffs were targeted at states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press, Branstad wrote in his opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious US tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, writes Branstad.
In the Beijing street press, however, there is only a limited range of differences of opinion, and the real differences of opinion that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all.
Branstad goes on to say that one of China's largest newspapers refused to publish an article he wrote, but did not specify which one.
Kavanaugh's failure to vote will expel female Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republicans are behind and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh could provoke a backlash, analysts say, especially in the upcoming midterm elections for women.
The sentiment surrounding the case has gone through a lot of rounds, and most Republicans have already declared their desire to advance the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed", states Grant Reeher, a professor of government at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake's recent offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
Women do not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November, says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the coming of November as they demonstrated in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republican Judiciary Committee decided to advance Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be appreciated, says Stu Rothenberg, an uncommitted political analyst in an interview with the news site.
People say that the excitement has been high, and it's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the insecure female voters and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't vote often because they don't like the president.
Analysts predicted a possible backlash if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court nominee, who made his allegation of sexual harassment.
"This is turning into a mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
It is not just a question of the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be questioned, it is about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Ford, Guy Cecil, head of the Democratic-supported group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony when the small majority lean toward the latter.
According to a new poll by YouGov, 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or likely, while 35 percent say they absolutely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
And 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's arrest, the FBI is investigating charges brought against Ford and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee on Oath that Kavanaugh had been harassing him while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated him to the bench at a student party when they were students at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet as a counter to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's intent to rule the world.
"It has to be done now", he said, referring to his startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data repository, or POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what kind of data.
The company calls it  data-driven personal empowerment.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to bring Solid to everyone's attention.
The company currently comprises a security platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some of the hired developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website, all of which are available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete transformation where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We do not ask their consent to this.
In his article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the town remembers the World War I hero Pope
The city is celebrating 100 years since the events, the only Victorian Cross medal winner in the Church of England, a priest who served as a soldier.
The medal of valor was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 in connection with the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglisen and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died four days later when a sniper was shot and never learned of his highest British military honor.
Two of her grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the wedding of his award-winning grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very dense fog and under heavy field and machine gun fire.
He later jumped to the front line and, with great bravery, led the advance of the troops before setting out alone to the field.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's work was something I could never compare to, something that would inspire respect.
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann went to the bar after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is a "great honor" to be part of the parade, adding: "A great crowd is commemorating the honor of a true hero".
Friends of the liberation match were on guard all night for the Bellator 206 tournament
Imagine a situation where you have been watching the bellator 206 tournament all night and have not even seen the entire event.
The programme of the San Jose event featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the round, the show was turned into a huge shock for Pipsa Pig's viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy to be up all night for the match.
A friend of the free-for-all opened up on Twitter describing the match being replaced with a children's drawing of a "Jonkins-like sick joke".
The law said that the content was not suitable for presentation at 6am and they had to switch it to a children's programme explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice-president for marketing and communications.
- The Piggy, yes.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said the timetables would be worked out so that UK viewers could follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a rebroadcast that will probably make the programme work", Coker said.
But it is six o'clock in the morning there, and we cannot put the programme on until Sundays in our time, which is Monday in their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages started going back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're limiting the number of games to five instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to offer our fans more, and we're trying too hard.
This is a tragic situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that his sexuality made him feel inferior to everyone else, but that motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says that it was not until he came to high school that he realized that not everyone is like me.
Speaking on the Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, Daley says she spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
She also tells how after the birth of her child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a longtime radio host, has taken several months off due to illness.
In her guest appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as a young person, she felt "less than everyone else" because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and work".
He relates: "To this day, these feelings of feeling inferior and different have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I need to succeed".
She says she wanted to prove herself so that when her sexuality finally came out, she wouldn't disappoint anyone.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and she is appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games to call for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give hope to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of her love for the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 as a surprise.
Daley married this Oscar winner herself 20 years older last year, but she says the age difference has never been a problem.
If you experience so many things at such a young age he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later it's hard to find another peer who would have experienced similar ups and downs, Daley says.
The couple had a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, which has changed the perspective of Dale.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been about winning a gold medal", he says.
You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father, Dale, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of just 40.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Dale was about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore to be in the front row", says Daley.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped, and it wasn't until she had really stopped breathing and she was dead that I finally realized she wasn't harmless", she says.

Half an hour at Mickelson's bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must betray a lot to avoid the record being broken by an unlucky performance.
Mickelson, who plays in the event every two years for a record 12th time, was transferred to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-ball Saturday matches.
The five-time Major champion, who is usually the center of attention, now spends half a day cheering and half a day on the field trying to get his act together.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National, where a tall-haired raccoon punishes unnecessary strikes.
If Mickelson is not up enough on the court, the ninth match of Sunday's match will be the accuracy of the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will be playing alongside Tommy Fleetwood, who is aiming to tie the four-win pipeline this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 games, get a flying start, Michelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Fury has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could he say in the situation?
"He understands perfectly the role he played today, he slapped me on the back, he nodded and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's a very self-confident man.
He's one of the best players in the game, no doubt, and he's brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play two games.
I imagined otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the end of it.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, but Fury says his presence brings something indefinite to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke at the expense of people, and he's a funny guy that everybody likes to be around", she explains.
I'm sure the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, too, and it's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leadership position can go quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a large-scale Ryder Cup management position before the final day of the doubleheader can become a busy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderram, where, under Seve Ballesteros, he led the American side by five points, but who emerged as the winner on the calcium line just by the size of his nose and won by the narrowest margin possible.
"It reminds me of how we led badly at Valderram, we led badly at Brooklyn, where we lost, but we won badly at Valderram", Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 53 games on both Friday and yesterday, moving to 106 games at Le Golf National.
History will show me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we're firing a large caliber.
We're going to the field and we're going to do everything right.
The game's not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that award, and we're only aiming for that.
As I've always said, I'm focused on these 12 players who play on our side, but we're aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world.
Enchanted by the way his team's players have handled the difficult terrain, Bjorn adds: "I never arrow before I fall into things like this.
Tomorrow is a whole different thing.
Tomorrow, the priority is individual performances, and then we'll talk about different things.
It's great to be on the field with your partner when everything is going well, but when you're alone on the field, that's when you're tested to the bottom.
This is a message that must be delivered to the players tomorrow for everyone to perform at their best.
Now we have to give up the partner who lets him go [on the field alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, the team's captain, Jim Fury, will require players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full transformations of the last day in both directions, having been part of the Brooklyn team that won before losing to the European team that won the Medina Miracle.
I remember every word of outrage he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team led his team to the final day of the playoffs.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start, just like we did in Brooklyn, or like we did in Medina.
When the thing is moved in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our setup accordingly and we're putting the boys on the field the way we want, as you know, we're going to do miracles tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the defense and he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the lineup next to face their European opponents.
"I put the guys in this order because I think it's going to carry the whole tournament", Bjorn commented on his two-game selections.
The new German warship is delayed again.
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014, but it will be commissioned as early as next year due to faulty systems and explosive costs, local media report.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the commissioning of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but concerns about post-delivery problems have stalled the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to available information, they are equipped with effective cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-surface missile systems and with escape technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal detection reduction.
The ship's main features include its longer service life. New frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting home port.
However, the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art military  which are said to be intended to enhance Germany's influence overseas  are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The badly-reputed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship since it was delivered.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media have been talking about the essential software and hardware that make the warship unfit for combat.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the fleet to upgrade later.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, with a capacity of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the overall project cost balance is also a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of getting new frigates into service have been raised by the recent warning that the German naval power is shrinking.
The German parliament's Defence Committee chairman, Hans-Peter Bartels, said earlier this year that the number of ships in service with the fleet was declining.
The Authority has argued that the problem has increased over time because old vessels have been decommissioned but not replaced by new ones.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to enter service with the Navy.
The Environmental Protection Agency is wiretapping the hidden lives of bats.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the land to hunt for food.
The new study is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
The National Trust for Scotland's study of the species is looking at the butterfly and the dwarf butterfly, as well as the earwig and water-beetle in the Inverewe Gardens, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
The study will place special recording devices at key points in the region to monitor the activity of the bats during the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequency of variations and the species at each time shall be verified by expert analysis.
The results will be used to create an environmental map and report showing the behaviour of bats in a regionally-scale image.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the birds and how different species are taking advantage of them.
The data are useful for environmental planning, such as the creation of pastures and forest management, taking into account beds and related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the population of bats has declined significantly over the last 100 years.
Construction and rural development are threatening the habitat and resting places of the bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying paper and certain building materials chemicals and attacks by pet dogs.
The fact is, the hooded ones aren't blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
The airlines use advanced landing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their runways.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental organisation which maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares across the country  and takes breaks seriously.
It has 10 experts who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups of resting places and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only protected area dedicated solely to the protection of bats in the Dumfries and Galloway area of Threave Manor, where eight out of 10 species of bats in Scotland are found.
Well, according to the land manager, David Thompson, the area is ideal for vacationing.
"Threave is very well suited for the holidays", he says.
We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
We do not yet know everything about bedbugs, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bedbugs need to succeed.
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bedbugs before restoration work is undertaken, as the destruction of one bedbugs' resting place can unintentionally lead to the deaths of up to 400 female and male bedbugs and the destruction of the entire local population.
The breeding population is the population of the animals in the wild.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Society for the Protection of Birds, encourages the public to take part in the conservation work.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn from our resting places, and we don't know how their populations are doing yet".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him a "false accusation" and says people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
Ronald's lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been charged with the 2009 rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel.
He is alleged to have paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram to 142 million followers just hours after making the allegations. The 33-year-old strongly denied the allegations and described them as "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today, fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal. I know.
They want to be famous by using my name. It's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine. The player continued to smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called, according to Reuters, "unfounded reporting on privacy suspicions".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will be required to pay compensation for his mental suffering in accordance with the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious personal rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronald and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into the player's room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was 99 percent a good guy, but one percent of whom disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later reached a compromise because of her fear of revenge and her fear of being subjected to public humiliation.
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking a settlement because he remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged overhaul, and moved to the Italian super team Juventus on a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would regret ending car manufacturing forever
Britain would be forever ruined if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was concerned about the announcement by the UK unit of Toyota that production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily suspended if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says that the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit is ended without a deal.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU suddenly at the end of March, our factory will be shut down says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the European Union as regards how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the report by the automakers.
The Toyota production line operates on a timely JOT principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and EU and the cars being made on-demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
The fact that the Derbyshire plant has more than 24 hours of sustainable stock is impossible, Toyota says, and production will be suspended.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's plan for EU relations is well calibrated to avoid these border checks.
We need a deal. We want the best deal possible, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we have to seize, he says on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must be able to continue the supply chains that have been very successful so far.
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union's factory manager, says that concern amongst members is growing: 'In my experience, jobs lost will never return.
A government spokesman says: 'We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week due to a scandal surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, Trump aides' ties to Russia, and the president's possible actions to obstruct justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump is planning to fire the assistant attorney general, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Mr Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday and was informed that the purpose of the meeting was to resign from his post.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not prefer to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because the timing coincided with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, which further delayed the vote of the full Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week because of everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court right now.
I'll keep you posted, but I always want to keep the press updated.
Some reporters may disagree with this claim: Sanders has not hosted a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked me why this was happening.
Sanders says the shortage of press appearances is due to reasons other than dislike for the attention-seeking nature of TV reporters, but he said: "I deny the fact that they are attention-seeking".
But Sanders suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
The President has more questioning hours than any President before him, he says, adding even more evidence without citing:We have checked those numbers
"The press will still be organized", Sanders said, "but it will be far better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me".
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this many times in recent weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
It's rare to be alone at a press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out the cause by appearing unhindered and oddly from time to time to the press gathered there.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the Scottish Public Health Service (NHS Scotland) workers from EU countries about fears of Brexit.
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the Scottish healthcare system's staff from EU countries expressing his gratitude and hope for them to remain in the country after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament member Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the Council with less than six months to go before the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of EU citizens applying for a 'settled' position in specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes: "During the summer, the negotiations for a UK-EU separation have continued towards decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-contractual divorce.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how much we value the contribution of every employee to citizenship regardless.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just got into it", Reed says.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on a side scrubber before putting him on the stakes and taking him to the side for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State reporter told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no information on the type/scale of the injury at this stage and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and is playing his first season with the team since moving to Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservative Party.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corbyn 's success in attracting young voters .
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May is to announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters, who has made promises of cheaper housing and has focused on taxing the wealthy.
The increase in stamp duty is aimed at individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money from this will be used to help the government to alleviate the homelessness crisis.
The additional charge  added to the current stamp duty, in addition to the double and investment housing charges added two years ago, can be up to  3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased from non-UK permanent residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the home market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK  especially its capital  have become aai cities because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes just weeks after Boris Johnson introduced a stamp duty reduction as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for cheap housing to remedy the shameful situation of Britain's accession.
Corbyn has published a number of noteworthy proposals for housing market reform, including the end of rental restrictions and the 'professional evictions'.
He also wants to give the councils more power in matters relating to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: 'Last year I said I would dedicate my prime time to restoring the British dream that every generation should have a better life than its predecessor.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can buy apartments as easily as hardworking British people.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far-fetched dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: My primary goal is to lead the Scottish national team.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is excited about the challenge of bringing home the northern corner of the country, currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he guided St Mirren back to the Scottish Football League last season.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I often watched the Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that's something that has always drawn me back.
I'm not going to get this chance unless I succeed as a manager.
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who have also been Sunderland's managers.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about joining the famous club in the shoes of his famous predecessors, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
I'm currently measuring my own success by whether I can get this group back into the League.
The structure and capability of the association make it undoubtedly part of the electoral league, he says.
"It's not easy to get in, but I'd probably consider myself a success if I could get back into the league with the team I trusted".
Ross has only been manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months on the Heats' coaching staff.
After this he helped Allo rise from the third series of knockout matches and promoted St Mirren from the knockout stage to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career at Clyden, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads with my career", he recalls when he moved to Alloa.
I really thought I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned a moderate amount of money, and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But it can be hard to play.
The player has to find out a lot of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and work-related pressure, but I feel like running a team is the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I'm doing it for a job, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life.
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a snack is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has kicked off Britain's struggling pubs, but has also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pub and bar sales increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
According to Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, the figures were: 'Continued sunny weather and England's expected longer participation in the World Cup meant that the month of July was June-like with pub sales up 2.8%, while the month for restaurants was even worse.
The 1.8 percent drop in sales in the summer of restaurants only worsened in July.
The most successful pubs and bars were those with a drinking-centric focus, with like-for-like sales increasing more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-centric pubs also suffer from bullying, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
Sales of drinks from pubs and bars operated by enterprises increased by 6.6% in the month and food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM, a consultancy in leisure and hotel and restaurant services, says: "The results continue the trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are increasingly the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home dining market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chain struggle continues, although the 4.8% annual sales decline is particularly sharp now that the sector is struggling with cost-effectiveness.
The long hot summer could not have been worse for food-focused operators, and it is only time that the movie's lower temperatures will bring the industry the breathing space it desperately needs.
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including new restaurants opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
One-fifth of children  some up to 11 years old  keep their social media accounts secret from their parents and teachers, the study says
A study of 20 000 high school students revealed the growing existence of fake Instagram accounts
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexual samples
20% of students said they kept a "capital account" shown to parents
One-fifth of children  some of whom are up to 11 years old  create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of fake Instagram accounts that refer to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that accounts could be used to post sexual-vibe content.
20% of students said they kept a clean headline account for parents to see while they used other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after stumbling onto a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40% of 11 to 18 year olds had two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle from the Athletes' Vote to the Scottish Athletes' Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as an independent member of the Scottish Athletics Board and will take part in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded general athlete, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sport decision-makers to benefit from the broad, international experience of the athlete over the past decade.
'Eilidh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the board,' says Beattie.
Doyle says: 'I look forward to my role as the voice of athletes and hope that I can be of use and help to guide Scottish sport in the right direction.
The four-time Olympic gold medalist, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his walking ability to a transient brain hemorrhage.
She tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's just time to see if I'm getting better and how I'm doing.
This has been a tiring job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I am practicing agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An advertisement comparing mothers to cows is spreading opinions online
The advertisement of a breast pump company comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows has sparked publicity on the Internet.
Consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has launched what it calls the world's first silent, wearable breast pump, which is promoted by a tongue-in-cheek, music video-style advertisement that describes the freedom of new pumps for breastfeeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a shovel filled with feathers, including the words of the following song: "Yes, I kiss myself, but the tail is not visible, and if you haven't noticed, it's not the uterus, it's the tits".
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, lick my limes".
However, an advertisement on the company's Facebook page caused a debate online.
The video, which has garnered 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has generated a mixed reaction among viewers, with many saying it's making fun of the daily "horrors" of the dairy industry.
The use of numbers in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth, writes one commentator.
The Elvie breast pump is unnoticed in the suckling arm (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter: "It is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to hold their baby?
The third commenter added: Perfectly reality-captive advertising.
The ad also got some advocacy: One woman admitted that she thought it was "crazy".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I still sucked.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product, one of the comments reads.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (mostly at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows".
The advertising is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps with their breast panels squeezed.
The concept behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, with no wires and tubes, and is unobtrusively fitted into the suction lines, giving women freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go outside during the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother, commented on the theme: The Life pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to bring to light all the challenges of using a breast pump, and we are acting in an entertaining and equitable way to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
The Elvie pump has been in the headlines before.

Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in complete silence
The number of children of Chinese immigrants has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration, which have made it more difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be required for potential foster families and other adult household members and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified last week at a congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for immigrants underage.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80% of people who are either members of foster families or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to search for these people, Albence says.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases the case must be heard in court within one month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, according to the reception centre staff.
Many prefer to appear via videoconference rather than in person in immigration court.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be expelled promptly.
According to reports published in recent months by receptionist staff and the system, the time spent in child custody affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly high in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of childhood dissatisfaction may go unnoticed due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to camping towns without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can be traumatic, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish fighter troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the EU would act accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its holy fight until all of Syria was cleared of both terrorist organizations and of illegal foreign troops.
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are primarily training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed over 1,000 troops to the ground to break through the fighting.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for returning and accused other Western countries of spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They politicized something that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war, as agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebel's last base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the region of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear time limits and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra fighters, who would be eliminated.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the committee of the new government and opposition members soon to draft and pave the way for elections in postwar Syria.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to the revision of the current constitutional provisions and warned against interference.
Why Trump is getting re-elected for a second term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a viral outbreak and scandal ended his presidential term prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential decision ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been seen in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of best-performing viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top of cable TV with 3.5 million viewers as the most important news show.
"This is a roihu that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, about a minister who becomes president after a congressional building was destroyed by a bombing.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Unlike other TV shows, of course, news from Washington can determine how the Roe v. Wade case will play out, whether immigrant families can get along with each other, and how the global economy will fare.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, outside the public's duty to be aware, it is six hours of expert panel discussion that argues that Bob Woodward's use of source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut-skinned pilot, and President Stormy Daniels' unadorned descriptions of Trump's anatomy, have consequences.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he's doing feels like a reality TV show because part of it is about giving the audience something every night", says Wheelhouse Entertainment executive and creator of Pantheon Movie, Brent Montgomery, about the changing personalities and daily plot twists of Trump's show (the NFL riot, the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single episode or you'll fall out of the carriage.
When I met with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was at his house on the north shore of the Kauai, and it was a beautiful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't walk away from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was on the Senate Judiciary Committee and it was about the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs and people were saying that it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Money flows from outside to a tight-knit midfield.
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, as the reorganization of congressional districts forces two already elected candidates to fight from one seat.
This recently redeveloped Pittsburgh constituency is a battlefield for Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his second term in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running for another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th Congressional District, which overlaps with the new 17th Congressional District.
The regional election was rescheduled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constitutional division favored Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which was widely watched.
The Republican had held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a great lead.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backed down.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the slight backlash from Washington.
President Trump had a warm-up meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization executive team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the recent guidelines that Taiwan is no longer recognized, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, was considered for the penalties.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a hard place in a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the authorities in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step in trying to prevent immigrants from seeking the United States.
However, in mid-September senior officials made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and this effectively ended speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a mid-October meeting some sort of indication of the weight the administration will give to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors mentioned in the above-mentioned paragraphs quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further annoying messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic matters anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
What History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible impeachment of President Trump, which is now very strongly documented in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump's campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself held accountable just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and potentially face the judgment of his peers.
There's a lot of talk about this, and I'm not saying that President Trump's loss is inevitable, any more than the loss of his peers in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine the length of this struggle.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage.
The course of history is at such turning points that the inevitable march for democracy is either accelerating or delaying.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What are we gonna do if President Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been under fire ever since the news came out that he had proposed secretly recording the president's speech and contemplated the president's possible inability to carry out his duties.
Rosenstein said the Times report was wrong.
What would we do if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible claims of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will be put into a long, dark winter.
But I believe we're going to succeed because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic post.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table that the butcher had decorated.
How could I be anything other than optimistic about the future with this tradition?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans as an optimist for Rapid Vienna
Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians would give the team a strong position in the Europa League G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Doran from reaching the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a benchmark for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", the 31-year-old says.
We went to the game hoping we could get something and we could take the point.
Maybe we could have caught the win at the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got the second one and we were better.
Thursday is another important night in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in the last game, but I think with the support of this team, we can do everything we can and we can get a positive result.
Last year was really tough with my injuries and the changes in the team, but now I feel good.
The setup is good and the boys are enjoying it; the training is going well.
I hope we can now be full weight, leave the season behind and succeed.
The fear of pension savings is driving women to sleep
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in a nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had discussed the matter with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
Start with this.
Tell your spouse and children that you cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you give your wishes in time.
Discuss with your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these are important factors in determining costs.
Take economic advice into the discussion: it can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or cost-effective insurance if you can afford it.
Create legal documents to prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative on site so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also writing a power of attorney to handle your financial affairs.
It allows you to appoint a trusted person to take financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital for a health emergency.
Can you answer any questions about her medication and her allergies?
Write this information down on the plan so you're prepared for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side of things.
What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.
A man was shot multiple times with a rifle in Ilfracomb.
A man was shot multiple times with a rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in Ilfracombe's Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the attack, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., as a random act.
Victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palun on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, officials said.
As communications to the area are disrupted, rescue authorities have received no information from Donggala Municipality in the north of Palun, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from the fire after the disaster.
Key information about Pal and Donggala on Sulawes Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawes Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawes Island, and has an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary celebrations.
Donggala County stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative region of the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province and in particular of the Donggala coastal region are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it's concentrated on the Morowali coast opposite Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra, off the western coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Sumatra Mentawai Islands, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A landslide hits the Acehin Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the massive devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of aggravated burglary.
According to a police report on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and preventing and resisting domestic violence reporting during his arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in Mat-Su Pretrial and has been given a $500 bail, KTUU reports.
According to the report, Palin appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported the over-the-top robbery.
This case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a weapon while under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of hitting him in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to a traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake struck just outside the center of Sulawes, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Social media is streaming videos of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in Palun City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The indictment alleges that Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental car in October to hit the West Side Highway on the South Side of Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the notice for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious physical harm.
The court documents show that both of these charges are possible for a death sentence to be carried out.
Weeks after the strike, a federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder in aid of a terrorist organization, a term typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of assault and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required extensive planning and preparation, and prosecutors noted and described the way Saipov carried out his act as "horrible, cruel and shameful".
The complaint alleging that Mr Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco states:
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time a court in the Southern District of New York has handed down a death sentence is a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York was in a federal case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed two years earlier for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
The prosecution said Saipov told authorities he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He pleaded guilty to 22 counts of being innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender's lawyers representing Saipov, said the defense was naturally disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death sentence without recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is a solution that only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to those involved", Patton said.
Soapov's defense had previously asked that he not be required to face the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today, in a protest against the Conservatives, promised to mobilise the civilian army.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure of eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed her to lead the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would be out already if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But May faces deeply divided lines as she mediates a challenge highlighted by conservatives who stand by and join a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal out of the hands of Brexit supporters and opponents, and the European Union's grip.
Supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback and force eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leaven event in Solihull that he wants to "squeeze the Chequers proposal to go".
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out of here", he said.
The Member for Wellingborough added: 'I support Brexit but the Chequers proposal must be abandoned.
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We did not fight the world wars to end up in the bottom.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone has blocked the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The claim that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is completely wrong".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither will the members of the party nor the activists who are really taking to the streets and are fully responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime Ministers can keep their jobs as long as they keep their promises.'
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to roll back a decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the right to a fair trial is a matter of urgency.
They are trying to water Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we do not approve of it.
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want politicians who are going to break Brexit to feel the pressure from you.'
We intend to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state.
Meanwhile, the stay-at-home movement marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the banners "Tories Against Brexit" that was formed this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with the party's app at the start of the meeting.
These are the people who say they will get the IT systems up and running and all the technology for Canada plus plus and the unfettered border operations for free trade in Ireland, he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehlin, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in the November re-election.
Warren has been speculated to be a potential candidate for President Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyock was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters since the start of the Trump term.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included a woman in the highest office.
Arrested in the Sims shooting at LSU.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they arrested a man suspected of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims to death Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. at a news conference.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the scene.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247 Sports.
Wayde was defending his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to the interrogation that he was present, that he held a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 6-foot-8 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the World Championship after the team offer him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements were an important part of the competition.
Bottas made a good start and left Hamilton almost on his own luck defending his place in the first two rounds by inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went to the bullpen first and left Hamilton to drive the pack on his tail, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went on the bike later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed after making some contact and the Ferrari driver moved relentlessly from the inside, relinquishing his defensive position after only two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back and finished seventh in the first round.
After that, he led the race for much of the time, extending the tyre change, aiming for a quick finish and a fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He finally got to the motorcycle on lap 44, but was unable to accelerate with eight laps remaining as Raikkosen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has had an exceptional career, winning two games, Hamilton said.
Very bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the event in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of the people's insolence, disgrace and dishonesty.
That one thing that is possible, that wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing the anger, the people who are angry, mean, nasty and dishonest, the president said.
When we see the publications and the leaks and then they say, "Wow, I didn't do it".
I didn 't do it .
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you compile this data?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document... oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't leak.
Just a second.
Did we... No, we didn't, he added the senator in a big way.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
"I did not hide Professor Ford's allegations, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes.
But his denial was not appropriate for the president, who commented on the matter at the event on Saturday: "I'll tell you that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and he said the Democrats were using the charges to their advantage.
They've decided to get back to power by any means necessary.
You see that viciousness and disgust, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule, Mediaite reports, the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two runs for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were in first place with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the team before Dwyer returned to the Giants' leadership position.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before Lukas Lundwald's two pairs confirmed the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who won 2-1 at Dundee as the bottom-seeded in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season after the Giants won three games earlier.
Dwyer's opening touchdown came in the fourth minute with 3:35 left to play by Kendall McFaul, who was played by David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled his lead four minutes later.
In the lightning opening period, Sullivan brought home the team back into the game with a time of 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cownies' tiebreaker with a time of 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first straight season by hitting the second goal of the night late in the first.
The home team gathered their line and Bouchard tied the field with a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen managed to make Dundee the first lead at the end of the second half, and he also secured his team's victory with a fifth goal in the middle of the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be heading home to Milton Keynes on Friday.
The pilot died making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake.
In Indonesia, a pilot has become a hero after his death by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers made it safely into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawes Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area and many people have been trapped in the dirty material in Palun City.
Although his colleagues fled in the face of the trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job at the mutiara Sis Al Jufr airport in Palus, a sprawling airline tower.
He stayed in place and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321 was safely in the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's Yohannes Sirait reported that Agung's decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was being prepared from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news breaks our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll will rise to thousands as the country's disaster authorities have reported a lack of connections to the cities of Donggala, Sigin and Boutong.
The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are buried in the ruins and many people have not been reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo.
Even waves that grew to six meters have destroyed Palun, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft are bringing aid and equipment to the area.
The 35-year-old family mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia's head of the International Red Cross, told CNN in an interview: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we don't know what lies ahead.
This is already a tragedy, but it could prove even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to ensure that all evacuation tasks are completed.
Are you ready? CNN is reporting.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
In Micronesia, representatives of the airline that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now report one person missing, despite previous reports that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
According to the airline, six people were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in a lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crashed over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said the passengers were able to dive into the sinking plane in the deep water for emergency exits.
He said the passenger crew panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen working on a nearby harbor repair yard were involved in rescue efforts by carrying people ashore in a rubber boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
Analyst's showing a time frame for the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office on Saturday completed a retrial in which a man was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone data to combine the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said she had obtained several cell phone location data that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to her earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers's house at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
The second inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information stored on their cell phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The final round of the defense is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
What is hip hop to be aware of?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from the original, whose messages were about politics and social issues.
They want to get back to the roots of hip hop and make hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of the UK with artists like Acala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues a couple for a racist text message
A New York nanny is challenging the couple's right to discriminatory divorce after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is a single black woman.
The couple deny being racist and equate the challenge with the church.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her sadness when new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and she learned that this was a dark day.
In July, this time in prison, Plasco-Flaxman wrote a text message to her husband.
Then, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice.
The New York Post reported that, disillusioned with his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that his African-American nanny who had received their previous departure pass had done poorly and this time expected the Filipinos.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for their separation and wants $350 a day for six months, which he was originally given to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to racist complaints by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision because they could not trust her after she was offended.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists, Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
But would you leave your child to someone you have been unkind to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco joined the challenge of the blackmail and I said that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
Should we start hunting another in a situation like this?
It was not very pleasant, the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, arguing for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that the audience would not be identified with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It is difficult to come to terms with the position of a person who first read a book before it was published.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
Knowing that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before devoting himself to writing children's books about the adventures of toy bears, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt bitterly sad because his father had died the previous year.
He described Paddington as a very important member of the family and said his father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, not a very flattering type", she says.
But because Paddington was so real to her, it was almost like a child's achievement to her; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think that's how he experienced Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave Paddington credit for himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my dying daughter.
His daughter was admitted to Nizzan Louis Pasteur 2 after the plane landed, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called a little and said the situation was so bad that he was not expected to survive, says Ednan-Laperouse.
And then Nad called and said that my daughter was gonna die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart going gradually left his system.
He died a little earlier, and now everything is gone.
I could just sit there and know it was over.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together.
Eventually, saddened by the loss of her daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the ordeal she was currently undergoing.
No one knew, he said.
I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a tremendous compassion for Nadia.
That she needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Women in grief send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis' son Tyler developed depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want anyone's parents to have to experience the emotions I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with an infectious sputum.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that her smile lit up the whole room.
However, he quit before his death because he felt that he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the aftermath.
Davis created these cards to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent. You have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davis for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of marriage shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that", Humphreys said.
The day before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the ground on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't take a look at them or anything like that.
She notes that Mark's death was a severe trauma for them, but they must work it out: it is breaking up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight for it.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a limited investigation in time and scope - we could perhaps achieve some unity", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "disappointing" the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
The reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans' success is as weak as expected, their quest to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports are prepared?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to blow the ball and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean loyalists are falling under Kim's rule.
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of people who have fled North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years later.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Reunification as saying that there were 1,127 breaches last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the implementation of the measures.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korean loyalists will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul is said to have had over 30,000 North Koreans cross the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats illegal immigrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Furthermore, technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the stalled talks on the demise of nuclear weapons.
This followed a historic meeting in June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on the Korean Peninsula's aspirations to nuclear non-proliferation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being stuck in sanctions zones after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally be the first to dismantle our equipment", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and "inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court".
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had acted like this, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was in control of his emotions, and at times he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak as he told about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic committee members for not calling themselves "grotesque" and "planned persecution" by the angry liberals who staged Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony would show he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats", Pelosi said.
When asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi wondered.
Let's put it this way-- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's currently working for, Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
He added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible health care reform orders or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
In the hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the court and we are expected to say that it is wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women have to get through everything .
This is a legitimate speech that burns for months and years in the fury of rage, and he cannot hold it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual at all.
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere and who said that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of telling her interlocutor in a situation where she got angry and started crying: 'You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears are justified as a way to unleash anger, even though they are generally misunderstood in a fundamental way.
One of the most memorable memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is when I once cried in silence over anger and an older woman - a cold-headed superior, whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your mind upset.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, extremely frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he should not run for president himself.
"It was not a well thought out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates and one more was the least wanted.
Someone called the situation "Lumic and Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was already long, he was behind on the fundraiser, and so he announced that he would not run unless he collected two million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
It turned out to him that some of his supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to male candidates, gave him only 250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she thought.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not campaign officially, he was overcome by feelings of gratitude to his supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for the election work for voters and delegates, and hatred of sexism that he could not speak.
"I could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my grave wall was probably being beaten up as a memorial.
She cried.
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening shot to the US-China trade war was a shock, and while the battle is far from over, the gap between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's main export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs affecting imports of US$200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all imports from China to the US.
Beijing has responded on the same scale each time, imposing the latest tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of imports.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye manner, and it does not appear that the world's second-largest economy is recovering for a moment.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would have to give up on its own demands, but public bow to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing interdependence.
An early political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that trigger an economic downturn in a country and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than site-watchers have understood so far says Abigail Grace, a research assistant at the Center for New American Securities think tank with knowledge of Asia.
Syria's foreign minister says the country is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after a devastating war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to normalcy.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic activities targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team by 16.5 points to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight European Championships, and it hasn't won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team held onto the crown when its Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, scored the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the tournament and hit his opening pitch in the water on a par-3 lap 16 giving up a match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was eliminated in the group stage of the European 5&4 against the most outstanding player of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could now play in his final Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golfers, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time winningest European with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have this win.
It is a team and I am glad that I was able to help you", said the moved Garcia after the European team's victory.
He's transferring the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods' 2&1 individual event on Sunday.
"I feel so proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a way through the weekend except for Patrick Reedy, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressed the European team in the games this morning.
We screwed up.
- Oh, my God.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm gonna have to lift my hat.
We've met our winner.
Red tide snowfall situation: levels falling in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in the number of fish in the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC states that more dispersed areas are reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a possible decrease in concentrations.
The Red tide ice sheet stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Leay County.
Boats can be spotted ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're less common than last week.
Red tide snowfall has also been detected in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County last week, ranging from low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County, from high concentrations in Manate and Sarasota counties, from low to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County and from high concentrations in Leigh County and Collier counties.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Leen and Collier.
For the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms in northwest Florida.
