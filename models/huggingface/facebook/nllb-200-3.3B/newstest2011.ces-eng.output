The SS in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the sugar factory.
The new city councilors from the Czech Socialist Republic will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and in the Representative Chamber.
Aktuálně.cz "tested" the members of the new council from ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang that has emerged in the council during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague political cream was introduced during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councilors didn't seem to understand any of the familiar terms.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm rather new to politics in Prague", said Lukáš Kaucký, the councillor for culture, in response to a test of the "kmotrov" vocabulary.
And although he is a veteran politician, councilman Karel Březina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole".
"It's the only one of the terms you've given me that I use occasionally".
"I don't recognize slang in general, by the way".
From the glossary of terms published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year, before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously connected to the Prague magistrate.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the bakery", "bull's necks", "betrayal of the capital" and "squatting".
Three of the councilors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the Prague school system in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councilman, Peter Dolínek, flatly refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all and I don't judge how the citizen democrats have fun".
"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to get along on our programs", he said.
As already mentioned, the councilor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the title above that it is about the influential businessman and friend of the expressionist Béma Roman Janouškovi.
Voldemort tells Kaucek nothing, and the only term he's got right on his test is "largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, and immediately adds: "But I know it more from the newspapers".
"I'll have to pay for some language courses", he jokes.
The golf hole is then deciphered as a tunnel by Blanka's administration, not only by matador Karel Březin, but also by environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachemu is familiar with the character's whereabouts - he suspects the meaning of the expression "go to the bakery".
"I think it means going to some Prague establishment", is Shady close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janouškov companies.
He shares Brezhnev's view that he learned from the newspapers rather than from a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test takers, there is no such a complicated vocabulary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it seems we don't really have anything like that".
"We call each other by name, sometimes using abbreviations and compound names", says Prague's CSSD chairman Petr Hulínský, who is nicknamed Hulda by the parties.
"In school they called me Brijza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", confesses Karel Březina to his nickname.
The name "Actuality.cz" has been tested and it works.
Councilman Weinert is known to the party as "Grandpa" or "Grandfather" for the sake of friendliness. Representative Miroslav Poche, who had revealed fraud in party sponsorship before the elections, is known to some of his colleagues as "The Toy".
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in party-speak.
Hulínský is said to dislike Huldu, but Aktuálně.cz newspaper has also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
The "Doctor of the Law of the Cluster" is said to remind that Petr Hulínský obtained his degree of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to curb the torture of "witches", and has published a pamphlet
Women accused of witchcraft in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
They are more of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent into isolation so she doesn't threaten the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very rare".
"Even young, healthy women don't give up because they are helping with work and childbirth", says a nun who cares for more than 100 women expelled by her community in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She's published a pamphlet of information to help curb the witch hunt.
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of Burkinabe adults cannot read", notes the newspaper Die Standard, a literary magazine.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African lands as well.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week after being tortured, doused in kerosene and set on fire by three women and two men.
The case was reported by the BBC's server.
The perpetrators claim it was an accident.
According to their version, the woman was burned by an oil used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have flown after a group tried to "exorcise an evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of their educational attainment.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul-eaters have always been a danger".
While the government is trying to curb the witch hunt in Burkina Faso, the president himself participated in the Gambia witch hunt last year.
"After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammeh launched a massive witch hunt, allegedly to have been responsible for her death and to have used black magic to try to kill the president himself".
"He enlisted the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal bodyguards, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai", said Amnesty International in a report.
At the farm, the prisoners were forced to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay at the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bachelor's tenant: drowning in the stove, higher rent signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the client company RPG Byty "uhlobarona" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a folder under his arm with new lease agreements for three apartments: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
All three of them just got their rent up by deregulation.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay 4100 crowns for the 2+1 second category apartment from next year.
"And there is no hot water and the petram must melt", the man points in his son's new contract, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it", he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which has called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man only waves his hand.
"One says this, the other that", he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are still rented out.
Actually, that's why he decided to visit the lab in person.
The RPG lounge in Havířovo is one of four in Ostrava and is already full at 9am on Tuesday.
There's a security guard from the security agency with a pager by the door.
"Rent 2011", a special button on his touchscreen lights up.
One tap, and a number comes out of the machine.
You don't even get to read "157", and your number is already beeping on the big screen under the waiting room ceiling.
You're on in half a second.
The rent is coming in for a few minutes, an older couple, but the waiting room is not about new rentals.
Most people came to deal with the usual problems - requests for repairs, insurance claims, and so forth.
Letters with new lease agreements have been sent to the post office boxes in Ostrava by tenants of most of the total of 44 thousand apartments in the RPG portfolio since around mid-November.
RPG Bythe offers them a 15 to 38 percent rent increase in their letters.
A special new hire desk was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's only a short-term thing", the staff behind the curtain respond after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD took it quite noisy, and even now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after that, I want a new floor".
"I didn't even get a change of the toilet seat", the man relieved himself.
Most of the workers are coming to see if they can get a discount on their rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises in a special offer.
The half-price discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15th.
The animal "deregulation" barrier is definitely not overwhelmed with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here for the 2011 rent", estimates the workers behind the barrier.
RPG also offers individual contract negotiations on its website and in its boards where necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the rent, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure", warns RPG on its website.
"No one will be judged here", one of the RPG Houses workers thinks, and the man on the street outside the client center partially agrees.
"I have 13,000 in retirement and I have 5,000 left for food, I don't have the money to go to court", he says.
But the workers will not be happy.
"We'll see".
"Mr. Zahalek is telling them in the media not to sign, so people are waiting", he thinks.
Rent regulations end in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byty their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rents are still below the level necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock", says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, pointing out that the neglect of the housing stock, blamed by angry tenants, is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the owners of the houses.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest $4 billion in rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be $5.2 billion.
A large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the waiting room in Havířov repeats several red-lined information.
'The rent increase of 15% or less in 2011 concerns 31 200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG flats.'
"And it's always going to be the most at $1.50 per square foot and month", appears on the screen.
Just 400 units in the RPG portfolio will increase rents by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter", the RPG notes.
2,600 apartments will remain the same next year.
RPG Homes promises that deregulation won't drive rents up by leaps and bounds, but will be spread out over four to eight years.
And he adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) the firm will put back into the apartments, mainly in the heat savings - new windows and insulation.
The priority is to get the people who sign the lease agreement.
The office is a nursery, architects understand
The Avriopoint administration building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
What you would not expect is a mini-school with all the makings - colorful walls, fancy furniture, a pile of toys, and even a miniature outdoor playground.
Since October last year, it's been open to the children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, whose studios have produced a number of important Brno buildings, had been planning for a space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs nearly 90 people, mostly baby boomers, and she was concerned that women designers and architects could get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced shifts, daycare is a benefit that Arch.Design offers its employees as part of its social program.
Women in construction and architecture are able to combine demanding work with childcare.
The idea of the mini-school was conceived by the Arch.Design staff themselves and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the Czech State Budget.
Thanks to grant funding (grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to buy equipment and equip qualified staff and operate for two years.
After the financial support (2 years) has been exhausted, Arch.Design is obliged to run the mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took a year to prepare and was substantially assisted by Economy Rating in applying for the grant.
The childcare is provided by qualified staff, the children are looked after by a nurse and a primary school teacher throughout the day, so that children can attend the nursery without age restrictions, although most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-school", only five children can attend at a time, but more may be added during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although the education and care is individual, the curriculum in the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they also receive quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school, including English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, with games, but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can check on their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed pickups from daycare centers far from the parents' workplace are eliminated.
Parents thus use their working hours more productively.
No wonder an employee-employer relationship is naturally formed.
Arch.Design was thus ranked among the Czech companies offering a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, is family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
A house made of bones is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like an ancient lizard's back, the staircase resembles a dinosaur's spine, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The house has earned the nickname "The Bone House" from the locals because of its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling a scales and omnipresent soft curves, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secesi.
The house's facade is marked by dreamlike lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When you look closely, you see geometry, rhythm, and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house is made even more dramatic, illuminated to enhance the impression of the brilliance of the colors.
The warping and the twisting of shapes are equally present in interiors.
The wood in the waves replicates window frames, railings, door trimmings, blinds, and rafters.
The Batlló house, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, is a reconstruction of the 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudi's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The stately home of Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí did not design it himself.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaic on the facade were created.
A number of other designers and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the Casa Batlló project started a successful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and the Güell Park, which houses other works by Gaudí.
The house earned the nickname "the House of Bones" from the locals soon after its completion, thanks to its organic shapes.
Others have called it "the whistling house" because of its unique mechanism for opening windows.
It is also said that on the top of the building is the sword of St George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique for its time, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre as it may seem, they have a 45-degree tilt.
Gaudí was not bound by the building regulations of the time.
At the beginning of the construction, although he obtained a building permit from the city, the data he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when the city council was shocked by the result and asked for a correction.
For example, the council was concerned that the construction interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, no corrective action was ever taken: only 15 days after the City Council's appeal, Josep Batlló applied for (and was granted) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner moved into the lower floors himself.
The second floor gallery was the social hall, and the third floor was the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building is divided by a staircase that leads up to the roof terrace itself.
The key elements of the reconstruction were the elimination of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The public area can be completely connected by opening the living room doors, and the larger company can communicate with each other comfortably, without at the same time retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The Gaudí-designed house has a new facade, an unconventional roof, and two additional floors.
Also impressive is Gaudi's play with light, with the blue and white glazed tiles that line the inner courtyard, and with the lights.
The two-color play provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
All they had to do was bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays.
Casa Batlló, which was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005, is open to the public.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and most ostentatious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided to do this in 2002, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They persisted in the inspection, finding it to be a very profitable enterprise, and further expanded the inspection to the common and loft areas, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee is certainly not insignificant, at 16.50 euros, and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders enjoy a twenty-percent discount.
The sum is far more than the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
To get a taste of the atmosphere of the dragon tower house, you must make friends with one of the tenants and visit him in his own home.
How to choose a mattress and a grill: women have different requirements than men
It is not the luxurious bed frame but the quality of the reclining surface, the mattress and the lattice, that makes for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmonically supplemented to suit the specific user.
Many factors are involved in the selection, including the weight, height, age, health, and even the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the grate are fitted is also important.
A typical example?
Latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, which are regularly flooded, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
But it is necessary to turn them over regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of vented channels in the core, and they're still on a hard board, they're retaining moisture: mold could be underneath.
Custom is also a factor in choosing.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high, softening mattresses are often used, will find it difficult to feel comfortable on low, hard surfaces.
"I guess all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn't sleep here".
"For their battered shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"These are recommended for people with diabetes, for example, who have a nervous system disorder and are therefore unable to process 'information' from joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specialises in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players and other customers have been in need of a mattress with foam for years.
"Today it's all right, the mattress is suitable for example Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
The "miracle" is simple.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape by absorbing heat, or adapting to your warm body.
Nothing's gonna get you down, you're not gonna be rolling around at night like you're fighting a heavyweight.
You'll just sleep better.
Linen foam also acts as a protective layer against the spatter.
When choosing the size of your mattress, add to your height the length of your foot, which is usually about six to eight inches [21 to 34 cm].
A man and a woman of about six feet tall need a bed of six to seven feet.
The minimum width for one person should be 90 cm for a double bed, or 180 cm for a total bed.
For single beds, such as singlets, a minimum of 120-140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and for possible visitation.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly curved in the elbow", advises Dr. Helena Prokopová, a member of the Association of Sofa Designers and Decorators, who has been studying the issues of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for a number of years and has taught at vocational schools.
For a double bed, each person needs his own mattress and bed rack, but be careful when buying to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you'll have to install the grilles at different heights, but you may not be able to do that for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring-backed mattresses at least 15, of which at least three centimetres should be counted on the forming and matting layer.
"When touching the mattress with your hands or reaching for it, you must not smell the spring", warns Helena Prokop.
Each mattress requires a specific type of mattress.
A full-length bed, where the mattress and base are like Siamese twins, is not a bedroom.
Mattresses don't ventilate well, can't be washed, which is common today.
And since we normally sweat about two and a half to three quarts of sweat a night, it's clear that after about five to seven years, the mattress will begin to resemble a large (and clogged) mattress.
For this reason, experts reject advertising slogans that claim a mattress' lifetime of 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
But everything has its "buts".
So, the advice from the sales team: for a 120 or 140 cm wide mattress, do not give up the hygiene and work removable coating, but add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are commonly produced today, they are drawn around the entire perimeter, so that when unfolded we get two parts (very important for washing and size of the washing machine!), Still, the manipulation of larger types (and one person) in the filming could resemble a lightweight fight in the ring with a heavyweight.
Do you have a hard drive in your bed instead of a grill?
I never did!
A guest bed for one night, at the most.
However, if the board is already empty, cover it with ventilation holes and use a spring-bone mattress at least 15 cm high with bag springs (such as Taschenfederkern) and a cast-iron mattress.
A polyurethane mattress is not the kind of mattress that you want.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-placement slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you will always benefit from grates with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the tail area are doubled and their stiffness can be adjusted.
The positioning slats do not include spring-backed mattresses because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the lamella, the shoulder cradle can be used.
This is a special grip on the blade that allows the blade to be pushed or even tilted so that the shoulder is "clenched" nicely.
For men with "shoulders all over the back", definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers have begun to use a shoulder-softening zone in the "master" style.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in the hips.
For the most demanding customers, the so-called multi-turn grates are designed as a rack or a plate.
The pressure is broken down into multiple points and the tension is reduced.
But be careful, once you put the wrong pillow (big and "overweight") on the right mattress and mattress, most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: The pillow should support the head and the tips should only touch the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on your side, the pillow should align (together with the shoulder cradle or the softened zone in the mattress) with the height of your shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straw-filled beds.
Increasingly, manufacturers are using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is to use mattress bio.
The crude oil from which the polyurethane foams are made is replaced by natural oils such as poppy and soybean oil.
Soya is used by almost all the major manufacturers.
"Bio for mattresses means that the core is made from materials of purely natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also allow the microcapsule to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There's also a division for men and women.
While the plant extract from the birch "cools" men to absorb heat and cool the body, the mattress covering "sets" women to sleep.
The extract from red pepper increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Today's favourite?
A mattress made of cold foam has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, making it more porous than regular polyurethane and offering better elasticity.
By combining different densities of cold foam and "linen" foam, they create multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thighs and heels are.
For a good mattress, you'll pay from seven thousand crowns and up.
Those that meet the health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are treated as medical devices.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattresses and grills is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, a manufacturer or retailer may offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers a Duofreeze mattress with a Memory foam mattress for $11,990.
The other one is free.
The era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density was started by the "cosmic" tempo of the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a NASA material because astronauts were exposed to enormous overload when they started.
Temperature softens in the heat, but it hardens in the cold.
It's perfectly suited to the warmth of the human body, and it's optimally able to distribute the pressure.
It is therefore ideal for preventing the formation of lesions, but also for improving sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in medical products, such as special foot pads that lighten the feet and the vascular system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and the like.
People-watching devices are becoming more and more popular with parents looking to watch their children.
Fear of having a child of their own is leading more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
A system originally designed to track cars can also track people's movements, helping in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anicka Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it may be as big as a watch.
Many people were alarmed by the case of Miss Anička's disappearance and began to look for ways to protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but it is just another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, there may be abuse of such devices, such as putting them in a bag for someone who does not know, but we have not seen such a case".
"Most of the time, it's really something that customers buy for security reasons", Pilin added.
He says that the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bochkov points out that if a child does not want to wear something like this, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in deliberately losing things when they don't want to be controlled".
"In the past, parents were very excited about mobile phones, which can be turned off just like these tracking devices", says Bočková.
She also said that it was questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of a planned abduction, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child has no electronics that could reveal his or her location".
"Now it's the phone".
"When surveillance devices begin to proliferate, they will be sought out, as their sale will surely be boosted by massive advertising".
"In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the case of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, a company that offers surveillance services for both cars and people, even if the surveillance device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
'The device may be set to periodically transmit the position after a certain period.'
"In the event of damage, at least the last known location of the person concerned will be available".
"The more expensive devices have built-in inclinometers, so even if a person slips and stays still, the device will send an instant alert with a location", says Čech.
He believes that a similar service can be provided by a navigation-enabled smartphone, which can be accessed by downloading special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they're either match-box-sized trailers or smaller cell phones.
They're always in danger of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why they are now testing a device that looks like a standard digital watch.
"This will have the biggest advantage in that an attacker may not even know the tracking device".
"Nebo will only recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time", he adds.
Whether the tracking devices evolve into bracelets or necklaces, they'll still use the same technology used to patrol cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (used in conventional car navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has fire-strings to envelop the Czech Republic, but they'll only last two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of detonation cords.
Last year, the Department of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of rope to the warehouse.
The army has enough for 225 years.
The problem is, the life of the cord is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the firing line from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES match ropes, wrote that the soldiers use 60 kilometers of matches per year during training.
However, military fire engineers' calculations, which MF DNES has consulted, show that all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would also have to undergo very intensive fire engineer training every year.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and the commander of the army Vlastimil Picka are not exempt.
That's the only way to justify the army's annual consumption of sixty kilometers of matches.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the Army's stockpile would last for over a decade.
If, on the contrary, the experts say that a maximum of six feet [2 m] of wire would be sufficient for the basic training of any new professional, the army would have secured itself with fresh supplies - even with increased consumption of the army's marines or special forces - for the 225 years in question.
The soldiers of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondr personally that they have almost no ammunition for handguns, so even the shots are limited due to the emergency of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I can't believe they're buying so many matches from us over and over again".
"But it's their decision and they know what they're gonna get".
"For us, the military is a good customer, and we as a business try to satisfy it", says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek also justifies the hundreds of kilometers of cord purchased by saying that the army will have a supply of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, talks about a lifetime of only four years for a match and even two years for police or military pyrotechnics.
"In perfect storage, it could be the four of you", says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to be named because of criticism of the army.
After the expiration of the shelf life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not free, and they cost extra money.
The department's other argument is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of ignition lines.
"It cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 240 kilometers", said Pejšek, spokesman for the defense ministry's buyer's statement.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firing lines by police pyrotechnicians who dispose of munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet Army has not exceeded 1 500 meters for several years.
And the police only order enough to use up before the ammunition expires.
It has proved this to be the case for fire safety, and it can more flexibly source more modern and therefore more reliable types of cord.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulty disposing of tens of thousands of tons of munitions from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 was preparing to march on the Rhine.
According to the Czech fire engineers contacted by MF DNES, the same problem awaits in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old matches that "lacino" is buying today.
To this day, I draw on the connections I've made through the contest.
The winner of the Businessman of the Year competition helped Lukas Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year's Entrepreneur of the Year competition was Lukáš Pytloun, a 28-year-old businessman from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacked quality, affordable accommodation.
With his savings from the Foreign Brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-demolished house with five flats.
For a third-year college student, that was a lot of courage.
"The current price/quality ratio of accommodation at our house did not prevent me from trying to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first apartment renovated began to rent to foreign workers.
He invested all his profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec, with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was the former four-star Pytloun Design Hotel.
This year, however, another one of equal quality was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov near Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties are applying for the Pytloun hotel franchise", says last year's number one entrepreneur.
"And the sale of the hotel licence was largely due to the fact that we won the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' competition", adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me, and I must say it was pleasant", she recalls.
The competition is highly recommended for anyone who is looking for something.
It's not even necessary to win, any exposure is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have otherwise.
"I started doing business regularly with some of the people I met through the competition".
He said that the glory associated with success affected every employee in some way.
And he's in his 70s.
"I suspect they have a greater loyalty and pride in being part of something that has gained widespread recognition".
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of the good work of all of us together".
"Only my name is put forward", says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had in the Farm.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the impact of the crisis.
But thanks to the winner's determination, Farmet has seen his share of bad times.
The first prize in last year's Vodafone Firm of the Year competition was won by the owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, at the Slavic House last year.
The jury then praised the efforts through which he built a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions from a small tool workshop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and has increased our confidence to face the competition", says the winner of last year's prize today.
Farmet's history began with a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered the father of Karel Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists' confiscated property, he did not hesitate, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father started a company for plastic baths.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eighteen years later, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has also gained greater recognition among the general public after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to perceive the Farmet brand much better, but also foreign partners have started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved more success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
But the year that passed was not just a year of triumph in the Farm.
The valuation was based on the company's economic performance up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year ever for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis reached its peak, and while it had not yet affected the citizens so much, companies had already stopped their investment projects and started to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either".
"We had to cut production and cut staff by 40 percent", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take unpopular measures.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, albeit less than before the crisis.
What they didn't do at the Farm is invest in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre with the grants, strengthened our presence at international fairs, and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
The market is growing again, and so are the new employees.
"I wish the new winner a good feeling of victory, but in a more relaxed atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
The questionnaire that removes nonsensical rules
The Absurdity of the Year poll is the fourth part of the Business Roundup.
Some of the nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdity Poll was the requirement to bring documents to the office that are also accessible online to officials.
More than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters cast their votes.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper copy of the business register, even though the clerk could get it with two clicks of the mouse.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a commercial register extract when checking insurance claims", said Jana Buránová, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
To look at all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to abolish those that are meaningless, is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business week of the Economic News and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If last year about 3,000 voters took part, this year nearly 4,000.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business, are still too many for us.
"For example, we are in the top three in the world in the number of tax return forms", notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The ease of doing business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving much.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is now ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held every year according to the same script.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, when the competition closes.
The competition organiser will then select seven candidates for the 'antique' and will have the public vote on it via the Internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey was filled with over 100 - 105 - of the most meaningless rules and regulations.
The tips came from businessmen, unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was the requirement that highway maintenance vehicles pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's competition week is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place every early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a hapening regularly attended by personalities from political and social life.
This year, for example, the competition was attended by Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing sticks at entrepreneurs, so my aim is to abolish every year at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate business unnecessarily", said Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.
Trying to overturn a senseless ordinance does not sound futile.
In 2007, the most common complaint was that entrepreneurs had to notify the local trade office three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or fair with a stand.
This obligation was removed by the amendment of the Commercial Code.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the labour office for up to 30 days' work trip for their foreign employee, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And to the third, good luck.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physical therapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator, and two retractable scales in their office.
This year, the health department's ordinance has relaxed the requirement to have a refrigerator.
A new category that rewards socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are assessed.
New this year, in the fifth year of the Business News Competition, is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first edition of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Firm 2010 competition has been entered by companies for whom business success is not the only long-term goal.
Each of their stories is so inspiring that it would make for a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities is diametrically opposed to that of each other, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered to be support and consideration.
In one case, it concerns disabled people, and in another, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
For example, the Czech Republic's software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then take part in a series of tournaments in various sports, was among the 14 finalists.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the charitable fund sponsoring disabled children for 17 years.
The paper mill in Poděbrady, which has more than 70 per cent of its employees with disabilities, has also been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the Region in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won the competition by introducing flexible working hours, which were further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a corresponding reduction in pay.
The title was also awarded to the company for its preferential purchases from Czech producers, support for civic activities in the surrounding area and environmental protection.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment", explains Miluše Ryznarová, the manager.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region is thinking about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the 'Human in Need' foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activities of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We are in turn contributing to food, transport, training and recreation", says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Firm of the Year competition who answered the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest were automatically entered into the category of Responsible Company of the Year.
The incorrect or incomplete questionnaire replies were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
'If the representatives of the competing companies do not answer the questions, they cannot participate in the Competing Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' competition Vodafone Company of the Year.'
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition, 'Firm of the Year'", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested during a public tender
The anti-corruption police arrested the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in the past days.
The detectives' team has hired local media entrepreneur and real estate developer Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender for settling restitution claims so that the land offered in the tender would be acquired by a specific interested party.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns to Luboši G.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for misconduct in public procurement and public competition", said the head of the Plzeň State Prosecutor's Office, Antonie Zelená, adding that no further details could be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
The police released the 46-year-old businessman after 24 hours.
The manner in which it might have affected public competition is subject to speculation, given the paucity of official information.
Lubomir Černá, spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said that the police had actually arrested people during a public competition at a secluded workplace in Plzen.
"It was a client, not an employee", she said.
The public tender is called "Call for submission of offers for the transfer of land rights under the Land Act" and is held in the event that several eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
'These persons offer, as part of the invitation, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land.'
"According to the bids, the order of the bidders is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the property to the person who offered the highest bid", explained a spokesman for the fund.
Mr Luboš apparently had information on who had applied for the tender and, as he was himself a beneficiary, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to the interested party not to participate in the tender.
He must have collected severance money for that.
That would explain why he had so much money on him when he was apprehended.
Luboš G. has had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF boss Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for giving a substitute restitution of land on which a decision on the location of the construction had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. obtained from the Fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial zone of Borská pole was to be built.
Later, he very conveniently exchanged it with the city hall for a house in the historic center of the city itself, which was worth much more.
The city council had to act, otherwise the blockade would have jeopardized the project.
Households are paying hundreds a month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supply and, in some places, even rent.
Families will have to withdraw from their wallets as much as 100 crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity will be up by 4.6 percent, gas will be up by about 2 percent, and you'll have to pay a tenth more for water in some cities, and in many places, the cost of central heating will also go up.
The electricity cuts should cost households in apartments hundreds of crowns a year more than they do now.
The main reasons for the decrease in the price of electricity from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, are the following:
Gas prices are slightly higher, but at times when people are drinking the most and are consuming the most.
So it's also worth hundreds of dollars extra a year.
While electricity and gas are costing more across the country, the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by the larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradci Králové will pay about 50 kroner a month more for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner a year.
Residents of Prague are threatened with more than 9 percent more water and sewage costs if the city increases rents on infrastructure.
If the rent is unchanged, Prague will accrue 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and livestock prices are to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rents in the 450 000 rental apartments where the regulation ends in January may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who don't agree to the new rent are going to sue the company.
The regulated rent paid by the people in approximately 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk on fern and rum, beer is out of fashion, it's slow acting.
Fernet, rum, vodka, and, exceptionally, a better brand of whiskey stolen from your parents.
These are the drinks that most often end up in the hands of doctors when drunk by someone under the age of 15.
Except for the kids who are treated for monkey poisoning in the hospital over and over again.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who have encountered similar cases in the infant wards of hospitals.
"Some beers and wines are completely out of fashion because they take a long time to get drunk".
"Hard alcohol is definitely the trend", said Luděk Pelikán, the Chief of the Children's Department of the Hořovice Hospital in the Central Bohemian Republic.
"If they manage to pull a bottle of Papa's from the cupboard, it might be whiskey, but otherwise it's mostly ferns and vodka".
"The vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not being so strongly smelled", explained the mayor.
And the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Yurin, also agrees.
"It's usually fernet or rum".
"It's the modern day alcohol, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was the saliva they brought from home", said Yurin.
According to the mayor of Pelican, 13 or 14-year-old drunks are a fairly common sight on hospital admissions.
Before Hřovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at the pediatric hospital in Motol, where ambulances bring in paralyzed preschool children from the surrounding area.
"One girl had been in our house, like, four times".
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 percent excess blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the fair in Holešovice for some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't think it was strange that she hadn't known about her daughter for 48 hours", the mayor said.
It is the lack of parental interest, or even their considerable tolerance, in their own children's drinking that is considered to be the major cause of the increase in childhood drinking.
However, experts say that there is no such thing as a true addiction in children.
"The term alcoholic is defined as a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the associated phenomena, and not in children".
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have a more symptomatic dysregulated family-social background", explained Mayor Pelicán.
According to a spokesman for Yurin, some 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital are included in the statistics.
Children who are drunk and whose parents take them home after an ambulance or are driven home by the police are not counted.
Besides the times when kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of booze, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be counted on, according to the Pelican: witches, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"Either they're drinking to regret a bad grade or they're celebrating the beginning of the holidays".
"But I have seen seven drunken children at the same time at the reception of the witch", remarked the Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night in detox under medical supervision has a paradoxical advantage over one who suffers a nasty hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are induced by a watering infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are actually better off because they have a good experience after the beautiful evening and a good awakening and nothing hurts them".
"They're just confused about where they are", Pelikán admitted, occasionally giving patients a good mood, at least considering the expense of their treatment.
The cost of transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in an emergency room could run into the tens of thousands of dollars.
"I sometimes used it as an educational tool, telling the children at the visit how much their drinking cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to save for that one party", added Pelican.
However, he claims that health insurance companies do not resort to regressive procedures to recover the costs of treatment from parents in cases of child alcoholics.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s, out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for a Casa C-295M transport plane, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
It's the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been abroad for training or show trips.
The two-seat version of the L-159T1 used by the Czech Army was capable of flying.
The remaining three machines are single-seater L-159s.
They're currently stored at Aero Vodochody, and the brokerage firm Omnipol took them over last week.
When the planes will physically leave Vodochod, is not yet known according to Jan Pejšek from the press department of defense.
'The single-seat L-159s for the exchange were taken from the long-standing stockpile without further deposits and investments by the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two-seater L-159T1s were replaced in their current state and form", Pravu Pejšek said.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seaters, as the ministry had signed a contract with Aerem Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two-seaters.
One new aircraft was delivered to the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to infiltrate the aircraft into the arsenals of some allied country.
'The contract clearly states that the L-159s are to be purchased by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.'
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this thing", said Pejšek.
The business newspaper said a while ago that the Spanish army, for example, was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa plane and the purchase of three more for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolánek.
The Department of Defense did not enter the tender and approached EADS directly.
The defence authorities argued that the exchange would support future export of the L-159 to other countries.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and only uses 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely be subject to a court order.
The European Commission had brought an action against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of a European-wide tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in 14 days.
Longer fingers than rings means less risk of cancer
Men with a longer index finger than a ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It could be related to the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men up to 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially when combined with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men in parallel.
More than half of the study participants had an index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They had the same risk of prostate cancer as the 19% of men with the same finger length.
However, for those with index fingers longer than their ring fingers, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men in their 60's, the drop was as high as 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones that the baby is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is the same as a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone is the main driver of prostate cancer growth.
Professor Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, told the Czech National Research Council that he was not familiar with the study but that he did not think that the link between finger length and cancer had been "fully established".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered with snow, and road crews have been driving all night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also the D1 stands near Brno in the direction of Praha.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club told the news.
There was a truck crash at mile 91, two trucks collided at mile 93, the accident left injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185, in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should take the 190 kilometre route just behind Brno or go through Brno and then take the 182 kilometre route to Kývalce.
They're forming a column for miles.
There's also an accident on the D11 highway, just outside Prague.
There's a few centimeters of snow in Prague, and the thermometer is reading minus seven degrees Celsius.
The cars are being built on Prosek, and Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are running late, for example on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague crisis team is due back at 8:00 a.m.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech railways have already had to cancel seven express connections due to snow.
The problems are, for example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already paved, but only with increased caution.
In Vyškov three minor roads are impassable, in Brno places are formed by snow tongues and in Blanensk snow chains are necessary to overcome some highways in high places.
The most affected area was Vyškovska.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They'll need to be fitted with a brake.
When they will be crossed is still unknown.
On Hodonínsk, caution is required in the White Carpathians.
The roads, which are maintained by inert sprinklers for nature protection, are covered with a layer of snow up to two inches [5 cm] thick, reported the CTC.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, most of it in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about six inches of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is a small, super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles guide the laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm cartridges developed for this rifle, containing highly explosive explosives, actually work like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point along their trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Because Shora is usually unprotected, and if a killer rain of steel flakes falls on him, it could knock him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who helped develop the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it to find the target, send a laser beam to determine the distance, obtain a precise aiming point, adjust the aiming point and depress the knob".
"Let's say you measured 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires a projectile at a range of 1,800 feet [543 m] plus or minus one, two, or three meters", stated Audette.
400 jobs to be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace from the existing administrative building in Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the computer and computer maintenance industry announced on Wednesday, it will move 400 men and women from its current office building in the Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex in the Lyonsstraße, a district of Frankfurt called the Niederrad, in July next year.
According to Fujistu's spokesman, 100 more jobs for the group, which are currently spread throughout the region, are to be relocated there in the foreseeable future.
The lease offer was very attractive and the large office space in Astro Park was more suited to the way the employees worked.
Also in Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu was only for rent.
Competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent airport connection is of particular importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of a major regional company yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The chief economist in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this had succeeded in gaining a 'global player'.
It's a "fantastic display of trust in this location".
Fujitsu is said to be a good fit for the city, the settlement is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in good time by the company's management of his intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company", Korwisi said.
But friendly contacts couldn't change the trouble the computer maker had with the landlord of the Marienbader-Platz property.
The decisive economic reasons were the result.
Now, the point is to avoid long vacations in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative".
Ten years ago, the Rathaus-Platz building, which Fujitsu had previously occupied, and the neighbouring 'Kleine Vertikale' were, together with the other buildings on Marienbader-Platz, among the most discussed building projects in the spa town.
The so-called city entrance was created between the station and the town hall as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both because of the massive construction of areas that previously served as parking spaces and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens at that time, moved into the house.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu-koncern is said to be the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The Rhine-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest number of Fujitsu employees is in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt/Niederrhein-Württemberg, the other subsidiaries being Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7000 square metres were rented for this purpose.
The complex - its name evokes the starry ground plan, which is twenty years old - is home to, among others, the central association of the electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon shuts down the server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting in trouble.
Amazon has disabled the discovery platform on its servers.
It's possible that this was done under political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is to be held according to a UK newspaper report.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server".
"Free speech in the land of the free", activists tweeted on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, Amazon, the internet company, had downloaded the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high number of accesses to documents in order to publish secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks tweeted an explanation for the move: "OK - we'll now spend our dollars on employing people in Europe".
If Amazon has this kind of freedom of speech issues, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after what it says were Senator Joe Lieberman's associates doing research, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reports.
"I used to wish Amazon would have taken this action sooner, given the earlier disclosures of classified information on Wikileaks", the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for other countries to be blocked from using the platform's servers.
"WikiLeaks acts illegally, brazenly and recklessly, and in doing so, endangers our national security and the lives of people across the planet", said one non-partisan senator in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
Based on a report in London's newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and Scotland Yard has the exact location.
The internet activist has always called the Swedish investigation a ploy by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange".
That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently reacting to North American statements.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks publication to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on TV - apparently ironically - that Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, a verbal spat has erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange would ask Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently published espionage challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of one person with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website".
The U.S. government is now conducting a major review of the security of its data banks.
The special counsel was appointed by the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers was made responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" needed after the embassy's reports were leaked to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the way the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be put in danger by the publication on Wikileaks.
"We have taken every possible step to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary".
The University of Frostbite
At the Gelato University near Bologna, the ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The three-day basic ice cream maker training course is in high demand, with visitors coming from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech ice-cream maker, makes ice cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler with a squeegee, wipes it in a tray and sells it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn more about ice cream, you can't miss the Gelato-University by the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker established an ice cream university to make the ice cream from his machines conform to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Gelatieri Foundation Course is a great success and attracts visitors from all over the world.
But there are also special chocolate ice cream classes for several days and an internship in your own ice cream parlor.
Some people are craving a new career in their midlife crisis, others are venturing off the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries on every continent - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the industrial Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant who wants to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian girls dream of opening an ice cream store in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of a perfect ice cream.
Not only is the taste good, but also the softness of the silk and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a touch of romance".
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender that electronically heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the machine on and the white pasteurized base cream, the basis of all milk-based ice creams, comes out.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can ice cream be made from only natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment alone?
Luciano warns against being carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
If you say that ice cream is "all natural", you may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product like guar flour made from guar seeds.
Of course, it's possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses and the customer eats the ice beans.
Certain variations of the substance are permitted.
It's more exciting with the aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano differentiates the flavor of ice cream according to the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit section or in the candy section.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to force you to have a lot of flavoured ingredients".
"You should just experiment".
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream base of white matter that turns eggs into cream-yellows and cocoa into the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now, the class is going to ice cream machines.
Luciano always has them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and ice cream - with or without eggs in the base matter, with more or less vanilla flavoring, or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be performed with fruit-flavored ice cream.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - not always the better, given the taste.
A hazelnut ice cream may not taste more hazelnut-y if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group using more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the mixture is well balanced does it really bring out the flavor of the gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach purée with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra sugar.
Luciano takes out the device that measures the sugar content of the fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tablets make the math easier.
Ice cream production is not as physically demanding as it once was.
It's not just the automated basic-mass-producing machine that helps.
There is also a machine that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to a negative temperature.
With all the automation, we can't avoid a little accident.
Brazilian Gustavo dirtied himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a giant blender went out of control.
"In any case", Maestro Luciano thinks, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens".
The two-way street
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA is linked to the industry which experiments with genetic plants.
The accusation has now been made by the group of experts Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well", said the head of the Munich Testbiotech, Christoph Then, on Wednesday.
The head of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying group for several years.
It's funded by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle, Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the EFSA control regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
Efsa's regulations are said to be in full agreement with Ilsi's documents, and thus bear the industry's handwriting, which should be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has raised the issue of conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from EFSA moved without pay or transition to the Swiss agricultural concern Syngenta - and thereby changed sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) also recently revealed a personal link between the EU Control Office and the industrial lobby, which has attracted the interest of both the Environment Ministry and the EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't recognize the conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, including those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, it says in a statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But they have to be documented.
Kuiper admits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize the current practice of allowing genetically modified plants in animals without any feeding experiments, and of not testing the response of genetic plants to environmental influences.
"We want to know what, for example, a genetically modified maize will do in the field", says Then.
Current practice is to test isolated proteins only and not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how could they be found?" asks the plaintiff, Then.
Angelica Hilbeck agrees with that.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe as well.
That's why there's hardly any scientists left who aren't connected to the corporations.
Most studies that are critical to society are not published.
"Industry is controlling security research", Hilbeck believes.
The stone trail
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing outside the train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the dredgers came and began to tear away a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was not the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
It was broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, soft coarse stone used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"It must not disappear".
It says, "A thin and poor stone, simple and primal".
When he cut one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The Stuttgart stone trail leads to the forest near Tübingen, to a former French army munitions depot, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man deals in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were made during the Stuttgart demolition.
"It would be a shame if they were ground up into gravel or disappeared in a landfill", he says in his office, a wooden box that used to be a guardhouse.
He says he was called names and threatened when in September, it was all over the papers that he had bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he spent days talking to the S-21 adversaries.
And he explained to them that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And if that happens, then it's only reasonable that the stones continue to be used.
Then about 200 S-21 adversaries took each one about 80 kilograms block, price per unit 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memento, some also hoping to return it when it's rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, loaded with 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the forest, the rest sold out long ago.
The gardeners, the landscapers, the home builders.
They came from all over, and they were pulling what could fit in the trunk and the trailer.
The Stuttgart spores have long since been turned into "sides" or the edges of herb orchards.
"This stone is actually nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political innuendo".
He gets into his off-road vehicle and takes a ride through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, dropped out, then biology, then computer science, and then became a stone merchant.
And a lover of rocks.
It has 40,000 tons of rock in storage.
He's collecting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antiquities dealer in the Republic.
It's slowing down.
The snow is covered with artistically crafted sandstone.
"They once belonged to the Marien-Bridge in Dresden", he says.
The Lab sandman, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favourite stone".
We're going up the road through the woods.
It shows a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And then some.
"This is a fine travertine".
Once the quads belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories in the snow everywhere, the Cannstatt-travertin from the police station in Stuttgart, the red granite from the church of Sankt Blasien, the tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a work, what a toil, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of the way the stones were broken by hand and transported by simple pickups and bull carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to crush".
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
But today, the stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, there are a few stone-masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass-maker and a gardener up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding", says the reviewer.
He's going to Kolin soon.
The stones will be saved there, too.
The Battle of Talents for High Potential
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are huddled together over salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
They're here to talk to VW developers about the car of the future - and to meet Volkswagen, by the way.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the brightest minds, like VW, and they're betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates from the classrooms as early as possible, before they're in the job market and in the hands of others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of their students' achievements, companies are trying to discover and attract exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to get talent the next day.
A young lady in the personal department is handing out pencils, gummy bears and VW logos.
He talks to young talent about internship programs, student jobs and suggestions for the way to the company.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig is taking care of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"VW can also get to know the students, get to know the interesting candidates and think about who would be a good partner".
Such cooperation, according to Sel, is not uncommon.
But the new thing is that he's fighting so openly for the students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial technical project", says Selle.
The fight for freshmen will be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from long lists of applicants.
On the contrary, they must strive and strive to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
Engineering graduates, in particular, have an excellent bargaining position.
According to the Association of German Engineers, VDI had 40,000 engineering positions open in October.
And according to VDI's forecast, the so-called engineer shortage will only grow.
Auditing and consulting firm KPMG is being hunted by Roman Dykta.
He hosts challenging recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a modern treasure hunt in which participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The two selection rounds shall decide in advance who will participate.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants will be flying to the US.
In the battle for High Potentials at the universities, the Dictator will impose increasingly harsh laws.
"We want to differentiate our race from the rest".
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us".
Seems like Dicta's talent scout is in luck.
"We have stayed in touch with all the participants in similar events last year".
"Some will soon be graduating and planning to apply for jobs with us", she says.
In addition to direct on-campus contact, SMEs are the main ones to be represented in the labour market.
"We're trying to contact alumni at trade shows".
The Commission also noted that the Commission did not provide any information on the exporting producer.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 vacancies listed on the company's website.
"It's just so difficult to fill vacancies these days".
"It costs a lot of time and money", he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiburg.
"Professors inform us that we have an internship or a thesis".
A solar specialist doesn't do any expensive publicity.
Instead, the company is trying to lure other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"The big companies often can't offer that", says the head of Stübe's personnel department.
Money has long been no longer the primary factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good prospects are other decisive factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th out of the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, the co-workers are asked about their satisfaction with their work and the working environment and the framework conditions of the employees are monitored.
The head of the staff department at the firm hopes that the placement will earn her points with job applicants.
"I think that candidates are particularly interested in external evaluations of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy for good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Krieger, that means, first and foremost, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your employees", he says.
In the professional world, this is called internal employer branding, the promotion of an employer in the marketplace within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
If a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a string", Kriegler says.
Obama is building new oil wells.
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding injunction, effectively cancelling the earlier plans.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast is also prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig in April.
In the wake of this disaster, which has claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, has signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
The focus of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is faced with multibillion-dollar claims.
The commission of inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar are trying to prevent a similar disaster by tightening controls and stringent security regulations.
The current reform of the Supervisory Authority, which has been the subject of numerous corruption allegations, is a major one.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would end lucrative tax-avoidance opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that the increased regulation will drastically reduce the amount of oil produced in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry", says a recent survey by industry consultancy BDO - even before the Wednesday drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change".
Investment in new mining projects is being delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni region burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of spilled oil have destroyed the nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People are living off theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", the environmental activist reassures the journalists, "you'll get plenty of oil sludge in front of the camera today".
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through the water surrounded by the smog: the scene is almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored glow of the water.
The fact that there is a brown oil deposit beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to gather enough shrimp in her containers, says Esther Badom, on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-moving water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled into a huge wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni region, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the most heavily flooded areas in the world.
The river's path through mangrove swamps with many tributaries reveals the full extent of the trough.
The engine of the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and if you dip your hand in the water, you'll get oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, and the rare palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain we seek out the flocks of birds that are common in wetlands: As soon as the boat's engine dies down, it returns to its former paradise, where it stinks like a pump, a eerie silence.
"What is happening here is an ecological war", laments Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of our health".
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement is a battleground where decades of fighting have taken place: the first European invaders arrived here more than 60 years ago, the first resistance movement was formed here in the 1980s, with the later execution of the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and the Shell company had to stop production here in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its employees.
Today, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while it is mining daily in the entire delta area, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipes, more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred yards, steel structures like bizarre statues, "Christmas trees", as they are affectionately called, spring heads, rise out of the water.
They're 50 years old, most of them are still alive at dusk.
At any moment, the head of the well breaks, Akpobari relates, and a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion gallons have been leaked into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years: The amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska during the Exxon Valdez supertanker accident 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history - every year.
There is a dispute over who is responsible for the ongoing ecological disaster.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists point to bursting wellheads and leaky pipes as the main causes.
Shell requires far less safety regulations in Nigeria than it does in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner complained in 2008: Only the number of fault lines is "several times higher than elsewhere".
In what looks from a distance like a deserted, oil-smeared workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to their necks in oil.
Under one of the many barrels, partly connected by pipelines, partly arbitrarily scattered across the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated for several hours in a barrel over a fire, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline flows from the pipeline to the container, then kerosene drips from the end of the pipeline, and finally, diesel oil.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four 300-gallon barrels a day: "We earn about 34,000 naira [$22]".
The people of the delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel fuel can still be exploited by illegal producers: they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to pipelines throughout the Ogoni region, which experts estimate leaks at least 16 million gallons of oil a day from the ground in the entire Niger Delta.
But only a negligible amount of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally refined: The largest part is filled into tankers by organized criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-ranking military officials, and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the residents and their interference or by a lax production method is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies didn't consider themselves intruders and if they didn't so thoroughly destroy the fishermen's livelihood, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refinery".
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular is so degraded that only the company's departure is in question: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better".
Michael is restless.
"It's time for you to go", says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers may come at any moment".
If a special military unit finds them, they'll face not jail time, but a painful bribe.
Even the soldiers, who are mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"This cursed thing has taken our country in all directions to the bottom", says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous design flaw in the A380 engines.
The A380 has a major safety flaw.
Investigators found a possible construction defect in the plane that made the emergency landing, which could lead to "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
Qantas passengers may have had more luck than previously known when they made an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction defect.
A possible malfunction could have severe consequences: cracks could be formed due to wear on one oil connection, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is also the Qantas airbus that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has filed a complaint in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows further legal action against this company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts got loose and damaged the nose surfaces.
Rolls-Royce blamed the damage on the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines worldwide have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will be conducting further safety tests on the giant jets equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security deficiency was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas crash landing, the airline left its fleet of A380s on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has grounded three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on one A380 as a safety measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall across the country will cause traffic chaos.
Germany in white: Almost the entire country snowed overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, and train and plane services are disrupted.
At least three people have died in road accidents.
Germany is freezing in winter: almost the entire republic was covered with freezing temperatures on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
Up to six inches of snow lie in places to the north and east.
Several highways and many roads are heavily restricted to traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but the newly introduced snow was not enough.
And then there was a strong gale over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a storm surge in the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowstorms have caused considerable problems on the highways and state roads in Saxony.
As a result, the weather station Meteomedia placed a purple alert in Saskatchewan, Switzerland - the highest ever.
A foot of new snow fell in parts of the area, and strong, fresh winds caused avalanches.
A few trucks and passenger cars stayed overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police officers reported major road problems.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic jams.
In Durynsk, there were snow problems on the A4 and A9.
According to the German railway, it's going through a lot of trouble in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, downed trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
In Saxony, the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Saalfeld of Thuringia, he had to stop an ICE to Munich.
The 165 passengers on the train received wool blankets, food, and drink from fire and rescue workers.
A snowstorm was blowing through the roads.
Many flights were cancelled at major German airports because of the snowstorms.
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said that cancelled flights from Munich have already been reported.
The airport operator has not been able to provide the information requested by the Commission.
Roads are in constant repair.
Although only a few passengers remained at the airport, 400 extra beds were provided for them.
Many roads were affected by the accident as late as Wednesday evening.
A truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was lightly wounded.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snow-covered road: a truck was also caught at a railway crossing because it got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which closed the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg until the early hours of the morning.
And a 30-year-old woman died after her car overturned on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
The good news for meteorologists, however, is that the snow will remain in the form of light snow, and therefore will rise even with light wind gusts.
But the wind will be weak.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of hurricane strength.
But it's going to be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for the Twin Towers .
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its brand: according to a newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank had just renovated its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district had been modernised; meanwhile, bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, the financial group apparently wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, according to a spokesman for the Financial Times Deutschland.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell a property and then rent it out again", he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany is thus once again relinquishing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from private investors and subsequently renovated them at great expense.
The energy conversion is estimated to have cost around €200 million.
The bank would probably make a lot of money if we sold it.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed 'Greentowers', at around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to the New Zealand miners who were declared dead after a series of mine explosions.
Rescue efforts have not yet been successful, as the safety situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a major explosion at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were trapped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the accident shaft, but found no sign of life.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, the rescue forces were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second powerful detonation, authorities and experts assumed that the miners had no chance of survival.
Still no success in freeing the dead.
Now they honor the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the south island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
Twenty-nine tables were erected to honor the buried miners' memorial, bearing helmets, lamps, and the names of the miners.
Pictures and personal items such as clothing and surfboards also found a home here.
Flags were flown at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would once again come out of the "deep" of the earth, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative event.
"But they never came home".
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was run over in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also attended the memorial event.
British and South African miners were also struck during the explosion on November 19.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases have dissolved, the process of cooling the high temperatures inside the mine will begin, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you warriors!
Does horror fit into an arthouse?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to redraw the old boundaries with his epic war film "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost supernatural force in a big way - sounds ideal for young gentlemen looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even beats his enemies' guts out of his belly when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word during the entire film, and the other characters say a sentence or two at most, or are swept away by the excruciating death cries.
Otherwise, they sit silent and languish in the hilly, rugged landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult film enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good to have a film with multiple audiences, it's just a shame if they're excluding each other.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized drug-dealer trilogy Pusher, is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refrains from making his works either more humorously mainstream or less brutally artistic.
Most fans of art cinema are probably put off by the brains and guts sprinkled everywhere.
Action film buffs are bored at the latest when One-Eye, for reasons that are freely explainable, sets out with a group of violent Christian missionaries to sail to Jerusalem and hang for all eternity in the windless mist before apparently sailing to America and remaining there in silence.
It is no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" was not released in theaters and is now only on DVD.
It's a shame, mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the peculiar facade, the places of blood, there is an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or plot, it's all about the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became a film.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn does not allow him a moment of release and slowly strangles him with his chilling footage and grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with the unspeakable hatred that burns from the characters' hearts.
Only the little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed One retains a measure of innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and temporary allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It represents corruption, perhaps, but also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for rage, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA's nuclear energy office has a new alert on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is not allowed to speak out - nor is it allowed to control.
Around midnight on September 5th and 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 20 miles [30 km] away, called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) her name appears when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that diverges from the stream.
According to a CIA briefing in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - a material that could be used to make nuclear weapons.
The technology of the '50s is good for nothing else.
The CIA has presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she showed where the reactor components might have been before the destruction, a scaled-down replica of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, photographs were submitted that showed the building up close or even from inside.
The reactor was shortly before it was to be restarted, but it was still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than it was then, and the puzzles have grown even larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was very sure that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that the country had an "active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence sources in Europe are even more cautious, and only mention the "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "realistic".
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how confident he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said last summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The alleged "unused military buildings" were quickly cleared by the Syrians and the terrain was also properly levelled.
However, in June 2008, a team of the IAEA led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has obtained, through the Member State, satellite photographs of commercial dealers from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market, because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown buyer - possibly Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program, nor did it build a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damasek said.
But the IAEA disproved that after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, he has banned auditors from conducting a second inspection in El-Kibar and from accessing the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on it", the official position of then-ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was recently confirmed.
The investigation has been dragging on since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem with respect to the credibility of the office", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA in Vienna admitted - after all, it is a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three other facilities that are "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and yet exist - to be key to advancing the case.
The auditors have not yet said what the devices are, what their function is, or why they are suspect.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally identifies it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects and found on satellite images of the building complex, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it's located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - which is precisely why Syria is refusing IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians feared a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent ahead of the US to search for military bases.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the device by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has documentation, and satellite imagery, that material has been transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in connection with fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e., enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where the plutonium for the bomb would be extracted from it, these central questions are only speculations.
It is also unknown whether debris that could conceal important clues is hidden in these three locations.
Hundreds of freight trucks seem to have disappeared from the face of the earth, and no one seems to have any idea where the junk got to.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar and across the Euphrates, which Syria inspected in 1998 as a suitable site for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria conducted ground work at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, there's talk in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent many months developing a plan for the auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - just the effort shows how much the auditors care.
Damascus has meanwhile rejected this proposal as well.
If a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the thing was not burning, for several months now, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the most powerful means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "a possibility that I'm leaning towards in the future", but is hesitant.
This choice carries great risks: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are not particularly interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens when they find nothing at the end?"
Love in a time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her still-untitled directorial debut this summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is unknown - but that too is cause for concern.
There is a persistent rumor that this woman, who is a Muslim, fell in love with a Serb man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned shoot was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film is in post-production in Hungary, but there's still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women War Victims wrote through the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported today Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN refugee agency.
Not very diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they declined.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In a rape camp, the love stories never end, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims is very telling.
Her organization recommended that the UN Refugee Agency release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had read her script, allowed filming to take place in Sarajevo after a minor setback - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young filmmaker stresses that she has no political intentions in her film, that she has devoted a great deal of effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give room to all parties involved.
It remains vague as to its contents.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war started and met again when she was dressed as a Bosnian Muslim woman in a Serb camp where he served as a guard.
Which is a lot different than "Rape victim falls in love with her tormentor".
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie says that the pressure on her is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now the Hollywood moguls can get her off the hook by illegally posting her script online, as they have done so many times before.
Nothing but gone
Tonight is another good night for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates the competition very strongly over their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans are shouting for joy at the sound of loud music, kicking their butts.
The Bailey Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is burning because players are throwing tennis balls 10 feet into beer mugs - and hitting them.
"Beer Pong" is called the bizarre theater and there is a chance to win 500 euros as a prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this loud beer game and the reserved computer guy, they don't mix well.
Yet, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to escape the burdensome questions of the future.
His plan is not to gamble his passion in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand in January for an interview.
"I have a strange feeling", he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job yet".
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as an Eventmanager straight away, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
With their prospects bleak at home, two of the Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leaving: like the tanners, it seems to happen to a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will soon be leaving the country, predict experts at the ESRI scientific institute for economic and social affairs in Dublin.
They even count 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions come true, there will be a wave of emigration similar to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980's.
After a decade of prosperity that brought Ireland great prosperity, unhappiness is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly distressing to young, educated Irish people, who have only seen an upturn.
The loss of jobs and social degradation seemed absurd in these boom years.
We needed everyone, there was no money.
Meanwhile, three out of ten men and women under 30 are out of work.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining: "Everything is going downhill in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against the politicians and the bankers - but those who can, go away and our country loses a generation".
"The last one please turn off the light".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is lying and offering no prospects for young people.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid internship to another.
Her biggest worry is that in four years, she'll have to move out on her own.
"That thought is sad and depressing".
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the positive side of the issue.
McLarnon is organising a 'WorkingAbroadExpo', an exhibition which offers a comprehensive service on working abroad.
"For those new to the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder", says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build somewhere else for six months.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
She's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he's working extra shifts to pay off the mortgage on his house back home.
"It's a crazy situation sometimes", he says, as he steps outside his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I'm not even in".
He laughs embarrassedly and walks through the cold rooms.
The little house is in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, big expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions", he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not go well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed and am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again".
A civil engineer doesn't like the yelling he hears so often these days.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as it used to be on this island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll feel Irish for the first time".
He laughs and then tells me about his father, who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back, and life in Ireland was going on, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
To leave the future open and simply wait to see how life develops elsewhere.
He's also had a few years of work in London, and why wouldn't New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there's one more thing that's been bothering him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn into a bachelorette.
"No emotions at all", he says, and drinks a lot of beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds worrying".
"Let's call it a going away party, simple as that, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
Two related things dominate this year's survey, which was conducted in September and early October.
The first is that Latin America is in a pretty cheerful mood.
The second is to increase stability in attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democrats, which is below the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year but a big increase from 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Around 34% said they trusted the parliament in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by an economic crisis.
The support was generated during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latinos living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, mood varies widely from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the violent crime situation worsened.
For only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Around 31% say that they or their close relatives have been victims of crime in the past year, but this is down from the 38% figure of last year and also the lowest number since 1995.
The stronger economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and market economies: some 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% support private enterprise there), despite their leftist president Hugo Chávez's expropriation of many private companies.
Brazil is the country that leads the field, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
Nobody expected the general election in Haiti on November 28th to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help the stricken country to fear.
The election was marked by ballot boxes being filled and repeated, ballots being thrown across the sewers, polling stations being broken into and intimidation.
The voting booths are open after hours.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them gave up in the end.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several supposed front-runners, have been screaming about the fraud and calling for the election to be called off.
Protests, some of them violent, have spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good election".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The anticipated deciding match is scheduled for January.
All hope of the election is not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, have backed away from their original call to have the vote declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no support among the voters, is branded by the electoral commission for having reached a decisive battle.
With the cholera epidemic raging and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so by the disorganization.
About 250,000 ID cards, which are required to vote, remained undelivered shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so it's clear that the Haitians are going to take it upon themselves.
Top to center
In the weeks since she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, has been enjoying public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 to over 50%, the highest since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Fernández gives up on the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And it's on those marks that everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policies after his wife's successful run for president, had a habit of making budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their extra income at will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and further destabilized by Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (with slapping and accusations of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", the president said.
The 2010 budget will now be extended to next year, giving the president more leeway to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1 percent, but many private estimates and unionists talk of a figure approaching 30 percent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was beset by an economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction over controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, he burdened the private sector, and he purged INDEC, the statistical agency that had agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18 percent next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world export prices for Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has disrupted growth since the great devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fernández has indicated that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces a deal with the creditor governments, grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes some $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact be kept from the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which would be reminiscent of the INDEC cleaning initiative.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term ends, with her husband no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, who are tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy will have subsided.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether or not to tacitly disavow many of the views her husband has held in politics.
Half-stimulus for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother overseas?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, voted on November 27 for the mayor and city council in the five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the sentiment that prevails on the mainland and has a strong foundation in business relationships, including a partially free trade agreement, in the biggest straightening of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% for the KMT.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has dropped by about 8%.
The first time was the DPP party together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election was held as most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags and sparsely dressed girls.
It even included a mandatory secret assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien clean through the face, wounding him and killing the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself was left behind.
Instead, the candidates have pushed for plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and resents China's military threats.
The KMT tends to avoid any ties to the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from inciting anti-Chinese attitudes.
It's a response to the fact and a realization that Chinese trade is vital to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma has confirmed for his party that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to use commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I'm sure they'd like to see political integration, too, but in order.
It'll be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP party has in any case discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was in a bad place: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president from 2000-08 was a hothead and a clear-eyed advocate of independence.
But under Ms. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has evolved that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was being called as the DPP's candidate for president, like Su Tseng-chang, who was in office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they too can work with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has released plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, assuming that their negotiations can go ahead without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry about this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's involvement, the DPP will struggle to choose among the potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's ratings were poor, despite the extraordinary pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return has passed".
Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
Performances at the request of the president and the public are legally required to pay attention.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is being billed as one of the surprise winners of this year's Grammy Awards with a Best New Artist nomination.
As Spalding has been a celebrated figure in the jazz scene since 2008 with the release of her album "Esperanza", the nomination came a bit late, but it is in line with Grammy rules that an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established".
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward, and with her carefree vocal style and nimble hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as a success that in 2003 was recorded by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters seeking similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other Grammy judges rightfully awarded the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the instrumental category, a thrilling, refreshing ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will be competing against the album by veteran saxophonist James Moody, "Moody 4B", and keyboardist John Beasley, "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans hardcore favorite and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's wildly steampunk-savvy group, Secret Society, won several deserved accolades in the big-band category, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the ever-bold Dave Holland, whose live album, the Pathways Octet, provided a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the classical music category
The classical music nominations at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a wide array of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto are also up for an award.
The classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year category has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classical album nomination was won by Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, nominated are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are nominated for the Grammy for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti", and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The roughly 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for solo instrumental performance with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avitala, who was performing at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral category for conducting the Chicago Symphony in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received nominations are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, the only female soloists nominated were Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical transition, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
The planned mosque in Temecula receives planning commission approval
The planned mosque in Temecula has won unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project as promoting terrorism and leading to a trade suspension.
However, the jury decided Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically pleasing.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you remember", said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen".
"It means that justice always wins".
"The opposition is minimal", he added.
"Those who are against it, only shout loudly".
"We have some really great people in our valley".
The hearing began at 6 p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight, with most of the time spent discussing with people who were for or against the center.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand".
"America is down".
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger, more suitable space than the warehouse space he had leased with a manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new mosque will be 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean style architecture, will also have two minarets and will rise to a height of 43 feet.
It's supposed to be on a 4.32 acre lot on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes resistant to arsenic are increasing the possibility of new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the search for new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has possibilities beyond the main elements that have been considered fundamental.
"This organism has a dual capacity".
"It can grow on either phosphorus or arsenic".
"This is a very strange finding, but it is not evidence of any form of truly 'alien' life", commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, the six basic elements that were considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur - were considered to be the most important.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"It's amazing to see what's still possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
The find is important for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this new find published for discussion, which did not disclose the details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation online that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "suggests that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be as absolutely necessary for life", explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiology Institute at NASA, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus".
"As a result, organisms have great difficulty separating these elements from one another".
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work like phosphorus, but when it enters the body, it starts working in biochemical processes", Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic substitution, it raises the possibility that arsenic-using life forms may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on other planets or moons where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a graduate assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but that no example has ever been found to prove this.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it might have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a Welsh Pembroke Corgi - were reported missing on Tuesday when a 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in at the Bellflower 6 Motel was stolen, authorities said.
Two dogs were found Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They were handed over to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what locality, nor did he share detailed information regarding their findings.
"Investigation is still ongoing".
"We do not wish to speak of it", stated Whitmore.
"We follow the rules".
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, have not been reached for comment.
They were delighted when on Wednesday afternoon their two events found each other at the Downey shelter.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akita Trace, a three-year-old dog named Trace and a 10-month-old female named Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were scheduled to compete in the regional competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unaccounted for until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they were scheduled to showcase Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog show trip.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside their rooms.
They also took three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a British colt - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and the Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit to give the dogs fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a stolen car at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the missing dogs, which have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the MGM restructuring has received final approval from the court.
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and television shows.
With the quarterly report that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, MGM is left with no legal obstacles to re-start Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum as the head of the shrunken studio.
The number of employees will fall from more than 400 to around 320.
MGM will not emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees to the planned financial resources to allow a $500 million loan to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
Now, it's a connection to an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to handle its finances as management struggled to afford the $300 million in annual interest payments.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial problems of MGM and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the US$2 billion plus the finance demanded by the creditors.
By the spring of this year, the plan was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan, and after months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
As MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the Moelise and Cooper firms will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect for their services, which manage the company's operations, $375,000 a month, receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive production at MGM, which has released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on the book, The Hobbit, with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your gift budget in balance
This year's top nominee is the most amazing iPad, followed by the video game system, but in both cases, it's a significant hit to the donation budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded cymbals or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your donor budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy stores -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club -- and looked at what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's tech toys have far more power, at the same price, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While relatively few new toys with associated webs have appeared, the two most well-known toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
But battery-button toys are on the rise, as are battery-chargeable toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their bellies.
One press will produce a note, and the second will produce a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice for the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, age 2)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also moonwalk with its innovative wheel-locking folding leg.
Children are testing the dance instructor's Mickey toy, though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn car rides into fun with work with a self-made, funny workbook.
If you're looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for 3-8 year olds) is the cheapest variant with easy-to-use, qwerty keyboard, although the games are not as effective in teaching as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3-12 year olds), the first major change to the Leapster series from the Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3- to 7-year-olds) uses an iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro, for kids 8 and up) is a set of five dice that are no bigger than a matchbox, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before the time runs out; this is great for improvised word-making competitions.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
The two toys represented the most in the toy shops were the Webkinz and the Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children aged 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits at the Club Penguin store for any two items.
That could include a roller coaster or a Puffle.
Slightly larger than the size of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and up), the latest in a line of button-battery microbots.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicon legs in random orientation.
It's fun to make a maze out of the dice and see if he can find his way out.
It's also very resilient.
Our guy was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
Introducing more nuanced police controls in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders at half-loud with military authority.
He wanted the female members - the Chinese city's stout enforcers, feared and despised for their toughness and penchant for violence - to make an impression on the passing crowds.
"Stand up straight!"
Hurry up!
Show them, she whispers quietly, "how pretty the girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged as per the ruler.
The four headscarves fit perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average", Mr. Tang said with a scowl.
"The models are nice".
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city watchmen in China.
One city ordered that new recruits have a college education.
Guangdong Province has changed the grey-green uniforms to the supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China has replaced the staring eyes with a powerful weapon: in 2009, one report said that 50 officers surrounded a snack cart and stared at the owner until the shopkeeper packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen to be the center of the operation.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police force, selected specifically for their looks, their looks and their young age.
The goal is to show the rough side of the police as well as the softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into the secret Chinese urban gangs.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei province beat an uninvolved bystander to death after he used his cell phone to film them doing it during an intervention in a landfill protest.
Last year, a training exercise was held in Beijing for police officers, and the manual for the training was stolen and posted online, and the manual included a description of how to effectively beat up offenders without a trace of blood.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon vendor got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
One violent video game that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has scared the government", China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after further discussion of the tactics.
The paper said "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics say that approach is not enough.
After the county announced its interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial page of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are just a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with good build and "five facial features in the right proportion".
The height of the adepts should be above the average - over 1.6 meters.
The service is compulsory at the age of 26.
Officials say the job is too psychologically demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing", said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there is the matter of character and "inner qualities".
Women are like vases, he said, adding, "Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district city administration, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are common for other jobs in China, for both sexes.
As is the requirement for facial features.
Which means the question of good looks is a hot topic among Chinese people.
Disability or mutilation certainly does not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or a hunchback to serve with us", said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would be bad".
Liu Yi, who is keeping watch on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, has a face like an apple and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, who works with the dollies, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city".
They do not object to their limited capacity, they said, because their career ambitions are more than just to push the merchants into the alleys where they can do their work.
Each morning, the group faces more than ten vendors who run on foot or on bicycles and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are evicted.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu, as the market vendor began to run away, leaving his noodle cart behind for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same", said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in her spare time.
"It's a lot of routine".
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to seize goods from vendors.
They can only threaten to report the incident to their male supervisors.
The tendency is then to shield them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after false rumors spread that police had killed a shopkeeper.
More than ten police officers or policemen were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed by the bar.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the policemen, facing the angry, elbows towards the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like the female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only a supporting role.
Unlike them, they're not trained in image maintenance and polish.
"Sometimes we fight with words".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"It's usually the public who starts it".
The prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The ruling ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012, whose affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigns office said it was "very pleased" with the decision, which followed an investigation of nearly a year.
The senator could still face disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of an investigation and that it does not intend to bring further charges against him in this matter".
The Justice Department has declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times revealed that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobbying deal that would have resulted in Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, being kept quiet about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier for the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for him, so much for the documents and the interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was barred by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appears to be in violation of the lobbying ban.
The evidence that was released "showed a clear case of preparation for violation", said Stanley Brand, a Washington, D.C., attorney who specializes in representing clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for their decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department is cautious about political prosecutions after a series of failures, including last year's decision to suspend prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct by the state's attorney general.
Federal prosecutors "clearly had guns", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the legal group that filed several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he got a call from the attorney general of the Department of Justice on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the Department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the plaintiffs to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a Wednesday statement, "acted within the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he presented to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice other than we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which an ethics group alleged that the payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons by Ensign's parents violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for was NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that had long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 revealed that after Mr. Hampton began lobbying for the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "buzzing" the Home Office about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton was hired to do lobbying work.
When the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he plans to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a statement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and close the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", she continued.
The Cheshire challenge is turning to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them in the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they were tweeting about the horrific testimony.
Finally, the defense says that over 140,000 Twitter posts dealt with the rape and bed-tying of children in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of murdering three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, was to be officially terminated with the imposition of the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed a motion to dismiss with requests and arguments that would likely occupy the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the widespread use of Twitter by the mainstream reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate infusion of information with shocking details then introduced the jury to a decision in terms of influencing public opinion.
This argument could force the judge to consider whether the advent of new technologies also requires new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced at this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technology in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for an individual", stated Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' lead counsel.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the state supreme court briefly rejected the claims regarding last week's proceeds, saying that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's not likely to be the final word on this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that the reporting of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision that the Sheppard v. Maxwell trial was "carnival atmosphere" because of the media.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the television show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal, reviewing Hayes' ruling half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to govern the way in which communications were communicated from the courtroom, which was unthinkable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was being carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be taken in by the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtroom could make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of many that Mr. Hayes's seasoned lawyers would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
The defense also argues, for example, that Mr. Hayes' case may have been biased because Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them the terrifying crime photos at the jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the photos of the victims, who were Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense also denies the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argues that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury that was critical of the prosecution, and that by his decision, he wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the most interest.
They argued in a motion against the verdict filed last month that the case had dominated news coverage in Connecticut and had been discussed during the campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media had been constantly fanning the flames of emotion about the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters in front of the court", wrote the lawyer, "was something that had not been seen here in New Haven before and is perhaps a national rarity as well".
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports and from their point of view the judicial police should control the scope of further processes.
But some lawyers have called for courts of appeal, with the oft-used argument that social and technological change requires courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayes's lawyers are seeking that right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in the Dr. Sheppard case, because of the scope of the trial, and they wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "is the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century".
Can courtesy cross the abyss?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of civility has emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first flurry of real cooperation between the two political parties, or merely an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the House leaders did not yield any major findings on the key issues that must be discussed during the session.
But in any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides and the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan infighting.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's deficit-control commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides the members.
And it's not easy to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a trial period - probing each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter tolerance for renewed partisan warfare.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants was conducted with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the relationship that has prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care, or rights, the two sides are miles apart.
However, the November election prepared Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question that regulatory issues have changed", said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up party emotions and then they went quiet.
It's good".
On a few issues, especially those that are scheduled to be discussed at the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one is taking them for granted.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans can't look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new initial treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a bipartisan relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of inconsistency, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widespread - that politeness leads to real cooperation.
"I look at all events between now and 2012 as a shadow box where the major events will occur in 2012", he said.
The reasons are largely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must live up to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supporters' lines are clear in the initial reactions to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and are, in their view, supposed to bring the issue of the deficit to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as a formal recommendation, and they are fighting to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among elected officials on the jury, who suggest that when it comes to financial issues, at least today, we have little basis or will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of a bipartisan conflict, with the Republicans challenging Obama over budget, tax and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What causes the shift?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that despite the partisan nature of the last election, most Americans continue to want to see two parties working together.
If it could be headed for a standoff, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching closely for public reactions.
Anyone threatened with a vote cut is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
That may be an optimistic view.
There is a greater degree of partisanship and bias today than there was in the mid-1990s, and it appears that there is a greater ideological gap between Obama and the House Republicans than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important elections in 2012.
Given this reality, the politeness that has emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A debased American document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption.
The city is run by a "kleptocracy" and it continues to receive some of the bribes and protection bribes that come its way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely maintain protective wings, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They take money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "office vertical" - will take its turn as money begins to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The report was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share in corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, have consistently denied corruption allegations for many years, and won several lawsuits for false accusations of such allegations.
In September, he said on a Russian television station, when asked about the evidence of corruption, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's shit".
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up on the ballot.
But it's unusual to see such details spoken of in this manner in an embassy report, and it's also unusual for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The Moscow city government and its association with criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' confirming that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as throughout the Moscow City government bureaucracy.
"Analysts have identified a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is on the very top".
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second level".
"And finally, at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors".
"It's an inefficient system where criminal groups fill the vacancies in certain areas because the city doesn't provide certain services".
The report says that the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police target smaller businesses.
One source said, "Shop owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (rather than organized criminal groups), as they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law".
"For this reason, gang protection is no longer as in-the-know".
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, the protection itself can be troubled; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their businesses are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
Embassy reports indicate men carrying suitcases, probably filled with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow-based research group Indem, said in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no political classes anymore".
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia over $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late at night, certainly did not excite the Russian government, although to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue a way to solve the problem.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin said that the documents WikiLeaks had leaked could have been forged, and reacted angrily to the claim that American diplomats were calling him Batman and Medvedev's Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it's about our interoperability, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront their past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and torn-up walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here is in love with Ta Moka".
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge's rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge gave up their rule, long-standing loyalty is being broken in Anlong Vengu as well.
In April, the victims were given the opportunity to publicly confront the people who were part of the regime at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum.
In June, the government provided textbooks that, for the first time, explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and its former soldiers to children.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly convicted the first former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng violent group, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew amongst the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that tracks the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"It's tearing families apart".
During the Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to shift to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the remote Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
No longer cared for by their patrons, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many have nostalgic memories of the time of the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people have had minimal benefit from the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were brought up without any idea of carrying on a trade".
Mr. Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok has fed everyone".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders of the assembly and those responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will also prosecute the four cases.
It was not enough to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If she was summoned to court, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are any more criminal prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would ensue if the court sought to find more suspects, though experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms means mending broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other".
The Centre has published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, a 75-page book entitled "The History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the law", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks and the courts are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
High in the Dangrek Mountains, a road covered with weeds and strewn with discarded plastic bags leads to a black-soot rectangle covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was cremated here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, many locals come here and pray to him", she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, bringing bundles of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees to dispose of its stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has spent years trying to convince Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it seems they hit a rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a couple of covert operations were conducted with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the remaining material - some £500, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it's a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves that the process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did that under George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear security, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity...we don't intend to make dirty bombs and we don't intend to sell it to anyone".
"We're just using it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and has expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the uranium in Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian Research Institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis", leading to the Clinton-signed agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Nonproliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium.
Belarus will, according to the Joint Declaration, aim to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the foundation for improved relations and is essential to the progress of the country and its people", he said.
The Spanish government didn't do the CIA's expensive flights
The Spanish government has not been paying much attention to the CIA's flights transporting imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the United States ambassador to Madrid put it in a cable.
This is shown by documents provided by the Wikileaks server to the daily El País, which also states that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "so that it could show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "put the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights over its territory.
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "found unprepared", Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Also, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to keep the issue as low profile as possible, but by putting the matter in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or any sensitive information", the Embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassification of information by the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch with the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very zealous for their independence and will do what they see fit", he had already instructed his colleagues to "avoid inflammatory comments with the intention of reducing tensions".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the actions of the Partido Popular political party (PP) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to exploit any indications that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if the revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government", he notes.
The admitted mother-killer complained online about maternal "worries"
A young woman spoke of a child after he was dead, and had her blog: "Terror in Galicia"
Monica Juanatey Fernández goes by the name "Muki" on the Internet.
The nickname, which she had used since she was a child, was used to communicate with her cousin and at least one of her friends, both of whom were from the municipality of Noia, in the province of La Coruña, where the young woman was from.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know the woman's emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with an industrialist, Ivan Túnez, in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon made a new acquaintance.
His chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the child stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, the content of her communications indicates that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is kind of mad that I left for work".
"When I told him, he seemed fine, but now he realizes that he has to be with the baby all day and can't do what he wants".
Then she talks about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address where I can send your child".
"If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother", she complains, "I'll take him when I get back".
In May, she talks about her return to her home: "I'll go this week, but I'll only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to work, so I don't lose the place".
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, which is me, and I'll never leave him with anyone else in my life except my mother", a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When this message is typed, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first of the month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on one side, but not on the other".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's quite happy here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day".
They're talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to summer school there, so I'll save some money for a nanny".
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, asking me when you'll arrive".
"Alberto says he sent you some video to e-mail, see how he likes it, come with me, sex is needed".
On the 30th, another message: "The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a message about Victor, the current partner, "Gives me money".
Monica's posts on the web are dedicated to anime and manga blogs.
She even had her own MySpace page, now revamped, where she called herself "Muki Ex-con".
"Terror by the Galician motto".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and guilt.
She doesn't want to believe that all this happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the county jail in Palma yesterday, where she came from the Menorca detention center.
The defense lawyer, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant did not remember how it happened and "that she did not intend to harm the child in any way".
Before that, she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and placing his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecution are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the Chamber and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of November 28th, the PP could have the lead in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes received and the number of experienced deputies during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has a certain idea about the general elections, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually one compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan populists won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday the PPC won by 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fueled by the shift of votes away from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, continues, analysts of the party have calculated that if a general election is held, the PPC could gain 12 seats in the Chamber of Deputies against the existing 8, the CiU party would also gain 4 seats (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (it will lose 25)
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the populists, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one MP - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or would gain another one.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next showdown will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the popular vote could also have a decisive influence on ending the dominance of the socialists in the four provincial capitals and on the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest budget foreseen - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose the Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona city halls, where the socialists would not receive a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona legislature - as it needs to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP increased its vote share in the four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only got 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The people also won in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell has provided thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda.
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner's Office in Barcelona formed a Thai-led jihadist cell that provided passports to various Al-Qaida groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the latter of which was responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" weakens the counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaeda at the international level and "thus limits its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, it could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then delivered to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of the organization Al-Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This disrupted cell was not the only active jihadist network in Europe, and therefore other European police units besides Thai police were involved in these investigations, and it cannot be ruled out that similar interventions will take place in other European countries in the coming days, as was the case in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (in which Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another one developed in Thailand, in which Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikan Kilayajbumrung were captured.
It was these men who were running a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, stole passports from tourists, which met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to be owned by men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years, and had to be without marked visas.
The investigation documents stress that no facts are known to link the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai attacks, even though the perpetrator of these attacks, Lashkar-e-Taiba, was one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this attack, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were "invested" to buy cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "gang" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is demanding that Massa stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Catalonia's People's Party) Alicia Sánchez-Camachová had the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Artur Masos her conditions for supporting his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to abandon risky businesses, such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wants to propose during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats won in last Sunday's election, a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting for his election to office.
The future alliance with the PP is the key to the nationalists' desire to maintain the House of Commons after the general election, but so far the talks Mas is having with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for the inauguration, "he will have to put an end to all the sovereign and liberationist manifestations", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - on which the CiU leader even wanted to have a referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the over-stretched political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's appointment will be discussed within the PP party of Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that no deaths have occurred due to "lack of measures"
The Olot Center's representatives do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joana Villa Dilme, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by the lawyer of the institution, Joan Canady, announced that "it is the wish of the home that La Caritat be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but that "law and responsibility obligate us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the institution's reputation that may be caused by the failure to reveal the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to La Caritat's homes is the current demand for material compensation, which is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilme admitted that his first crime was committed in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the nursing home's clients, suspecting that in many cases the deceased were not seen by a doctor in person but, because of the age and poor health of the patients, were seen by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, yesterday resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any case be the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party other than the accused himself committed any wrongdoing".
The man now known as the Angel of Death admitted to 11 murders yesterday, specifying that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second old lady.
In this case, he caused death by administering an overdose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a blend of tranquillisers.
The director of La Caritat said that it was difficult to control the access of staff to medication.
In six of the nine cases, insulin and a sedative cocktail were likely the means used by the caregiver to kill the patients in an effort to relieve their suffering.
However, the analysis that is now being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila was not lying and was really looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering broth, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the medical claims and does not exclude that the number of dead may be higher than what he admitted, and justifies his behavior in the various versions that Vila presented to the court with the knowledge that he must change his behavior when it became known that he had killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the justice to clarify the full scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted strongly yesterday to a threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The marginal differentials closed strongly and the European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's capacity to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market, which, although in decline, is recovering, but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It's gonna take a while for the investor to get over his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity ratio today, and tomorrow it will have to cancel for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to buy back the state debt for insolvency be terminated and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be eliminated within the deadline and that unlimited access be maintained for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast liquidity levels "at least through March" and to adhere to the three-month unrestricted bidding period until the end of this quarter, to guarantee liquidity at least through June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying program and even announce an intensification.
If they don't meet the expectations that they've created, they'll re-create yesterday's market reaction, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw liquidity, God help us!
It was the same at the May convention, where they said they weren't even thinking about buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - tomorrow could be history repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and resilient.
In May, the armored fist announced on Monday and on Wednesday it announced it had already bought many, triggering another market collapse.
Yesterday's tender for a one-year exchange in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only bid $500 million at 5.28%, compared to $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
The rate in Portugal was thus reduced by 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures published represent losses for Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent roughly 10 billion in short-term securities and another 15,000 potential ones that have a chance to become private by February or they'll be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to reveal the problem in July through stress tests, the amounts are acceptable under the aid scheme and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the new budget approved by parliament and still does not have enough support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened her tone to ease the tension in the face of the upcoming EU summit on 14 December, which must reach a political compromise that shows we are a union and all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment - to investors' ears, it sounds like the Four Seasons by Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank has been swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
We have a key three-year bond offering today that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will create a large demand that will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
To ask for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - El Tesoro has $40 billion in cash, three times as much as in March - plus high interest rates and market access would be closed to us.
However, the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only be, but also seem" - should be continued.
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group is challenging the Vega Sicilia deal requested by his children
The storm of open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not going away.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, attacks, after calling it "totally insignificant", El Enebro's legal action scheduled for the 16th of this month and requested by five of his seven descendants, in which they should try to force their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities the power of attorney of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are putting together a legal team for the next chapter in their controlling dispute over a part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem to be willing to settle his dispute over membership of the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
Five of his seven descendants were removed from the board of directors by the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, and their objection is registered in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro trial scheduled for the 16th of this month, called by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has renewed the rumbling in the womb of the Alvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is considered by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of judicial trickery and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the act of January 18, which was completely invalid".
This argumentation will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this act as "totally insignificant".
The actors themselves, who have been discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the court to convene in June.
El Enebro, a group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, is 100% owned by the seven descendants of David Álvarez.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, demands a right of use for 51% of the capital.
This is the key issue that the judge will have to decide on when he hears the challenge, and the date of that hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull's entry into Formula One in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been one of surprise and success.
At first, no one took the prospects of this new team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari to triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In reality, it is a powerful software simulation of gaits that the German firm launched in 2007 for purposes far removed from motor sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision machines.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thereby avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft, and the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to make "in a few hours, in near real time" modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians, who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single season.
The Red Bull team today has 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyse and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all the elements of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Modifications are being made to the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced manufacturing systems using laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical expense is the $40 million, the maximum that any Formula One team can spend in any season to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art facility about 30 miles from London to design and build its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great mystery".
The list of participants in this project is 580 people, including two pilots - the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is without a doubt the new champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
But behind the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in the racing circuit, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Chief technology officer Steve Nevey says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% of the victory, and the rest was drivers' credit.
Today, that ratio has changed, and technology costs 85 percent of the success, while pilots contribute 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, since they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 own shops in cooperation with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, yesterday inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shopping centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, vice-president of HP Spain, cited as an example the newly rebuilt store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), with Barcelona being the third.
Herrera declined to say where the next stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the next locations.
Herrera, who also runs HP's HR systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening stores would remain the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company is developing an exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be tested interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in the provision of staff for the shops.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of shops was intended to 'improve customer service, services for SMEs in purchasing, handling, after-sales service and even packaging'.
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot programme to tackle problems with computer equipment in warranty.
The online service is linked to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We can solve problems that would otherwise take two days to solve in 10 minutes".
"This system is designed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contracted technical assistance service", said Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that in three years it will "steal" a million clients from its competitors.
More optimistic than other bank bosses, Banco Sabadell's deputy board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but he rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is expected to reduce interest rates, which will be compensated by lowering bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to have a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in the tough economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without having to resort to public assistance in FROB, but also to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - or 700,000, minus those who eventually leave the bank - since the institution has so far been more attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies than to small customers.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private customers is 3,5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another key idea of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or even sobriety, to reduce costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Not many banking institutions today dare to set goals and make them public, because the financial crisis has changed the whole plan of the world's banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, which was set up four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the situation in the markets required an extension for another period.
The clients who leave the savings bank will be their main target group.
At a meeting hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the Spanish crisis "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years' time, it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that the passive war - which lowers margins - is receding, the risk premium that banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity is already being passed on to the credit prices, thereby compensating for the lower margins.
'The liquidity and financing issue is structural and will be a credit push factor.'
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high", admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of spreads - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now to reduce commission", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain does he assure us that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
"Next year, there will be no stone left unturned", he assured.
It confirms that capital requirements are 'substantially reduced' and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter the red.
It also points out that FROB can substitute in the market for the raising of funds before the new capital measure.
Assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers are predicting as a new liquidity crisis continues to pose a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes further wave of merger savings
The Director-General of CECA rejected yesterday the idea of a new wave of mergers, insisting again on the speed with which the sector is being reorganised.
When the process of grouping the Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a new wave of such operations yesterday.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into Banca Civica Group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are the conventions".
"Most of it is complete; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes are already done and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which has cooperated very well in this matter", the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of ADEA (Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon - ed.), Olavarrieta described the process of concentration as taking place "with the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as it is shown in the instalments that have appeared in the business plans of the National Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"Going from 45 savings banks with an average asset size of €28,000 million to 17 with €75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus complying with the Basel Treaty", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unfortunate views on the slow pace of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the National Bank of Spain is doing is a reminder that we have to be on time before the end of the year".
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" the world, and blamed those who question it for "lack of knowledge".
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation "we can be calm" about financial institutions and even the system, which has managed a "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking had performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the whole Union.
The market tension has provoked a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for SMEs, through the regulation of private intermediation agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro for unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management - note), the managers of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, supported by former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in the current crisis.
How do you interpret this movement?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is at odds with the idea of keeping to old traditions that a large part of the other members hold.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern countries would leave the currency area.
The second is the return to the brand - although it may seem like sci-fi now, this version has a broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
A third option is the German proposal to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, fiscal austerity, fines for failing states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for distortions now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission instigated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of the constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the contradiction between what Germany considered to be the right thing (fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this central European country when Merkel painfully delayed the decision on the Greek bailout.
It was already the subject of much criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, was strongly against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again came out with a clear position, demanding that the European Union treaties be reformed to allow for the rescue of a Member State while at the same time obliging private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This view was interpreted as anti-European, because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything.
However, her proposal, albeit in a somewhat watered-down form, was approved and in the coming months we should be following the Union's reform process, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And he tells us all that, although measures must now be taken, which he seems to disagree with too much, from that date the old way of working the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished and may be forced to declare deferrals, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a rigid path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply will not tolerate another option based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as was the case in Spain during the boom years.
The offer is clear.
And we would be mistaken if we didn't understand that.
This is not just a renewal of the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong about ourselves.
I hope that this current turbulence will be replaced by a more peaceful one.
And that we will take the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting with big business last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel, the road has been opened to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone by a full set of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that we were warned.
Sports and By-passing
The finesse of Alonso and Ramos in their match against Ajax shows ingenuity, not intent to escape punishment.
The allegedly orchestrated dismissal of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergio Ramose) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 has caused a sea of ink to be written on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether UEFA should eventually punish both footballers.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the named players deliberately lost time one by one at the moment when the foul was to be played, in order to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing top of their group - and will be able to continue, stripped of their cards, to the next phase.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee suspended coach José Mourinho for two matches and fined the offending players.
Provoking a yellow card under similar circumstances is not a new practice but more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos of football, the rules that are unwritten but followed.
Part of the debate in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team was involved (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honour, and which has already punished its players for similar acts), and, apparently, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocateur.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these acts are circumventing the law; they are in fact actions respecting the sporting rules, the meaning of which, of course, seems to be circumvented.
It's about the damage that this kind of behavior does to the spirit of the sport.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, which in these cases has not been violated, meaning that there has been no violent play.
Another of these features of fair play is to avoid giving players an advantage over the opposing team by committing an offense - which did not happen here.
So the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that there was no what we normally characterise as trickery or circumvention of the law, no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but rather this behaviour had to be as visible as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and they were happy to be punished.
The next question is, What advantage will the guilty party of their willful transgression have?
It must be noted that the opponent is not put at a disadvantage and that he does not benefit from the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in future matches.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and yet by doing this, the players will collect their punishment and move to the second round of cards, in which elimination is one less card than in the first round.
So as the rounds continue, it's not clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which is to make strategic decisions that allow maximum benefit to be gained within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with, the players did not have the goal of avoiding the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
While the line between wit and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case, it was clearly wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them were transmitted from the management.
The violation of sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
The bidding war for the Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictation concentrates this year's avalanche of reservations on December 16th and 17th.
The party is quickly becoming paid by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish med or lottery, with the arrival of December comes the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but due to the crisis, they have turned into a fight to win customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for a meal, according to the businessmen and associations in the sector surveyed.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) on the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for the peak days (16th and 17th) while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, many companies have cancelled group parties for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees pay for the cost of the parties out of their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices that are beyond their means, claims the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the restaurant establishment's board of directors is not at this time to venture to predict what the festivities will be like this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation".
"They want to get along, but they are cautious about the price", he adds.
Shops will do well with those "that offer quality and good service at a good price", he says, noting that the crisis has made customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around €25.
A survey of various establishments shows that the largest influx of reservation requests is on the evening of December 17th.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in reservations for this Friday, with most requests for expenses up to 30 euros, which they have matched with the menu offered, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
Another major company, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar with more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to keep the prices from last year, and our menu, which everyone should choose from, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
The AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after having recorded an increase in profits since the second half of the year and has relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
Sources of the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of €30 or more, as they noticed a tendency for guests to spend 10% more on other items, such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine) compared to last year.
They also noted that companies are now appearing to recall their employees, and the size of the groups appears to be slightly larger.
Vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "are booking up to the maximum".
This impression has not diminished during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points.
Pakistan's nuclear program has generated great unrest in the United States.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a rate faster than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the connections between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, published by Wikileaks, confirm the extraordinary anxiety in Washington over Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to providing illuminating and significant details about the content of the communications and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear security is "on the decline" rather than increasing, and that the volatile Asian country is producing "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not dismantled but are stored in sections to make it easier to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson calculates in a report before a visit by then-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of nuclear materials to transport".
The increased number of individuals associated with nuclear arsenals and guided missile programs is no longer seen by only the US, but also by Russia, as a growing and alarming cause for alarm.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev told a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news in the documentation released by Julian Assange's server is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claimed: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of help are not answered or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, states that "despite economic disaster, Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons faster than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also urges Washington to "make it very clear" during the visit of Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani military must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-level counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red notice" to track down and determine where Assange may be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued an "emergency red notice" to "locate and track" Assange.
However, this is not a classic restraining order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leak of over a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations facing an Australian in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on November 20th, when the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, Interpol has 188 countries on its instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to placing him in provisional detention and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person subject to a red notice, many member states, the organisation explained, consider a red notice to be an arrest that must be carried out by the national police, especially where states have bilateral extradition agreements, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a story claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also point out that Assange requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter states.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother is defending her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in the dark, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave a Skype interview from an unknown location to the editor of Time magazine - in this interview he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the U.N. in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign", he said.
His comments were rebuffed yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high-ranking official in charge of counterterrorism, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of the documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange to the list of priorities contrasts with the views being promulgated by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to explore the possibility of listing Wikileaks as a terrorist organization "so that it can be targeted and prosecuted against anyone who contributes financially or otherwise provides assistance to them".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, declaring that Assange should "be killed", which he subsequently retracted.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use a drone or something".
The one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient", he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "winking" at supporters of Carrod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote on its continuance in a secret ballot.
Huguet proposes more plurality of executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to combat the decades-old internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Republican Left of Catalonia), which has been unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader José Luís Carodo-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot worry about it as he had with other vanished currents.
So the Leftist leader will try to win new critics by using the twilight to help him get into the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly vote to keep him in office.
By ballot, not by a show of hands.
If Carrod's supporters want to turn a criminal vote over to the chairman, they can do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the division and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would not be a good result "after Bulgarian".
Carod's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture they consider to be weightless, since Puigcerdos controls the largest body in the assemblies.
But since they don't have the majority to force a resignation, they'll try to remind the executive of the plan between now and May.
To that end, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which the leadership will put to a vote in the National Council on the 18th.
Their goal is to support Puigcercos in exchange for him promising to move the congress as early as the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader declared that "multiplicity" was detrimental to stability, and that his goal was to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, an article by the current adviser Josep Huguet on his blog seems to be a landmark.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideology, this innovation consultant took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five, two of which were excellent.
The first is to "re-compose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means to include also new faces who are from the sector favoured by Carod.
The second target could be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely abandon the meeting as a mechanism of action.
And so he fights for the reform of the statute so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by vote.
The end of the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós's team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two conferences.
However, the 2008 Hiccup Assembly decided that schismatics must be evaluated at a special convention on statute reform.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has been deterring from resolving this matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in the month of November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico saw a decline of 4 cases compared with 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the MILENIO daily.
Among the murders, the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of dismembered bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
In the last two months of the year, there were 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, the body was found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, as well as a mercy shot to the head, and had her hands and feet bound by rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the trunk of a car above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán neighborhood of Naucalpan County.
Early on Thursday morning, November 4, cooperatives discovered a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshot wounds to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero district.
A note was found next to the body, signed by what is believed to be the La Familia Michoacana criminal organization.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight bullets in Nezahualcoyotl after he left his home to start collecting trash.
On November 7, two victims in their 30s were shot in the head and killed in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a man was found dead on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony, shot in the forehead, and a .25-caliber bullet was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the sewage channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue teams have done a thorough search for other parts of it, but they have not found them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body with hands bound behind their backs and a head wrapped around their neck at the Pena Colorada site.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported, who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, with the victims also receiving death threats.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes County, La Paz.
A nearby colony was found with the remains of a body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan, in the county of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning a man was found dead wrapped in a blue and yellow sheet in Huixquilucan, who was identified as Mario Ríos, according to a note left by the killers with his body.
In Ixtapaluca, in the San Francisco Acuautla neighborhood, a woman was found lifeless with two wounds to the back of her head.
The tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte and necklaces bearing her likeness were found on the woman's skin.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found in a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by the criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the same message were found in the Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victims were given a message, probably from one of the criminal organizations, that said: "This is what happens to those who don't adapt".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found, with torture marks and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi outside the Justice Center in the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first was cut up and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and had a message left with it; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Agents found a note with a report on it.
China keeps to its greenhouse gas reduction target
The country's delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 affirmed that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it is sticking to its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But he made clear that China would not change its goals and would continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He said that China's climate change strategy is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made on all these points, including the approval last year of a new energy law that includes proposed greenhouse gas reduction targets, he explained.
Furthermore, it was stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in coordination with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
He also said that various multi-year plans were underway or had been completed, and that they were funded by both the Chinese government and governments of other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the past five years, has received investment from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
Also running the provincial climate change project, the bulb-to-saving bulb exchange project and the mitigation and adaptation project, to be precise.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than many people think.
For example, he illustrated, China's greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tons, while the United States' is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use - for example, it has increased its energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The expulsion of the Spanish, César Nava, is legalized.
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - translated) stated that the former chairman of that party was entitled to claim his rights from the National Organizing Committee.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, confirmed that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal and that the former president of this party was entitled to address the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview taken before the objection by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagudo, he said that the exclusion of Espino was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Organizing Committee".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the Organizing Committee of the National Council in order to address the decision made by the competent authority,' he added.
He went on to explain that this is not the time to think about 2012, and that she was never at the negotiating table about the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This [the 2012 alliance] is a topic that has never been on the table, at least not yet, it was a plan for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he said.
The PAN chairman said that his party had 71 years of dialogue behind it, and that "internal competitiveness does not discourage us, on the contrary, it benefits us and strengthens us", he added.
He said the committee can choose without debate the best chairman or chairwoman that the PAN deserves for the next three years, so he'll pass the baton to "whoever the committee chooses".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, "whoever of the five I am proud to hand over the office of party chairman".
He predicted that the party's rise in the last election in July would be reflected in future clans, though "it's not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, with their roots in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would be the flag and the subject of observation throughout the country, since "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be rewarded by these expectations".
When asked about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) for his speeches during his four years in office, Nava called on PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI think the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderon, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shells", he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive branch has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no use of the whistle or censorship in this country.
Obama tweets about the law to support undocumented students
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", the US president tweeted on a popular social networking site.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students, in a tweet on his personal Twitter account.
"If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass the bill", Obama tweeted.
His briefing notes an Internet link to a more extensive document that asks the public to immediately contact the senators as the vote on this bill approaches.
"With the vote expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block passage of any bill unless it passed an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and funding for the government.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect votes on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new nonproliferation treaty with Russia, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockage of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there is still time enough"...
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year"...
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would be asking for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so that the bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though more likely next week.
The Senate's passage of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before turning 16, stayed in the country for the past five years, and were accepted into higher education or the military.
But the supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, and they need the help of a few Republicans, so the supporters' organizations are agitating intensely to get the bill passed.
The Democrats, who Dream Act supports the most, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has expressed his opposition, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act supporters need to get a few Republicans in case more Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are most likely to negotiate are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who filled the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it again.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John McCain, has not yet commented.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
"Poner el dedo en la llaga" is a Czech equivalent of "to put a nail in the head".
The second round of the Language Delight cycle was a parade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this Sex in Language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to open the second round of the Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another round table dedicated to the topic Sex in Language, she explained).
"It's a pain in the neck", the Argentine writer eloquently told the audience, which was mostly young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the round table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and attended by Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, May Monter and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz later described as a great story, in which Luisa played the protagonist in the first person, who, in search of knowledge, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get an answer, although the same story is true.
She leaves the infectious disease clinic with the conviction, "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it's my weak suit".
Finally, after frustration with the trauma doctor, who took her breath away halfway through the procedure, but explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents the actual opening and the symbolic one is the scar".
The protagonist sighs with relief, concluding that "only so much has been learned about the wound that it is actually open and that it does not exist", but she has come to believe that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also came up with a delightful story, which he called the Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the shot, but in one moment it appears.
with elements of magical realism, tells of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or restored the honor that a maiden had lost, this story which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning it was not lacking its own chroniclers who told it, and is quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration in the narration of the captains of the conquest.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the faked testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but otherwise never succeeded in telling the story of America with such a pictorial grace that it lacked even shame".
However, he stressed, "it is the fools and the liars who have the greater imagination" and it is where truth and falsehood merge, where it is no longer known what of a story belongs to one group and what to the other, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the Cervantes tradition.
"It is his legacy that has made us what we are".
Mayra Monterová then emphasised and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its thesis Finger in the wound had enabled.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed her finger at the great wound of social violence that is passing through her country - and shared by Latin America - as a result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise that is obviously not intended", she said after noting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasised "this finger in the writer's wound bound by the writer".
He said that in a world of hurrying, intellectual habits, and mind controls that are overflowing with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every nod there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must add color: and adding color means many times to put a finger in the wound and to annoy those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also annoy the authorities who prefer this black and white world", he said, to support the meaning of writing.
Romano is going for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he's had his ups and downs in his career, but he's already made it to the playoffs on three occasions.
Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two teams with different styles and different techniques, with different results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with a draw, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, staying one step behind the winner and, curiously, playing with the same team the following final.
Santistický reached his first final as a coach in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had the club Morelia in his hands, with whom he lost 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he again entered the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, again against "Diablos" of Toluka, Rubén suffered another defeat, although his team played against "Uzenář" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - ed.) after 210 minutes of play in a 2-2 draw, after a series of penalty shootings, he got the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed from 11 steps and the team thus suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Having already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, Rubén would like to avoid the same fate and rid himself of the curse, and thus celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him it is the most important institution.
"I want to come out as the winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but that's the first thing that's most important", the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
He has a vivid memory of the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we have learned that until the referee does not write the ending, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned in this, until the match is over, we can not celebrate".
He is not worried that this series could be decided in penalty shootouts, he believes in his players: "You never try to reach a series of penalties, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, unfortunately for us but fate prepared the wrong move, perhaps because of the nerves or the anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands but we lost it, that left something in us and let's hope that this time something like that does not happen".
In his hands, Romano has a chance to stop being the other and taste for the first time the glory that titles bring.
The United States is changing its visa policy
People will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before the interview at the Consular Section; costs will be lower and waiting times will be shortened.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa application process at the Embassies and Consulates of the United States of America will change.
The new procedure will require most applicants to contact the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before the interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC personnel will collect the applicant's biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The overall cost of processing a visa will be lower, with no longer having to pay a fee for arranging an appointment, another for processing the application and another for delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will simply contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
As biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second interview appointment at the Consular Section will spend less time there than in the past.
Also, those who apply for visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay an additional $26 service fee.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could make a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that may confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in outer space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When invited to the press, NASA assured that it would present "a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", which has sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who could present the possibility that they might one day become intelligent creatures like humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any life form, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic to sustain its life, and it's this ability that makes it more likely that similar life could exist on other planets that don't have Earth-like atmospheres.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will prove that "there is another, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will include Pamela Conrad, a geobiologist who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan, Saturn's largest moon, with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Cover agency and Patrón are the opposing "bloc"
The reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress are leading to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th Parliamentary term had not even begun when an opposition bloc was formed in the Congress, led by the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Partido "Sod" and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalve, who declared himself independent, and the four were discussing one thing: the arrival of "biopartism" in the Chamber.
Before the opening of the session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "grinned" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they said, "Bapartism" begins, because now two people from the same number of parties will control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Britto of the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech for "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms constitute institutionally a political marginality from the backs of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and the PAN.
He said that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they did not have it, they would be subjected again by these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"Once they (the opposition coalition) got here, that's how I look at it, because we're excluded from any decision, they're not even willing to consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that they agree with PRD, PT and Patrón, and therefore they will form a pluralist group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, once a monopoly, now be "duopoly".
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that, at present, the Congress has become "the spoils" of two - in an allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be one party, now it's two".
Patrón Montalvo has asked that the member's identity be respected, that he be given a seat at the table.
"So that we five members, who are probably nine now, but who are five at the moment, do not remain because of the agreements reached outside, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, since the problem is that we are outside the reform that they have created and agreed, and we do not agree with this reform".
Another 200,000 pesos are being spent on the "adding"
The city of Mazatlán is going to pay another check to the owner of the company that supplies the electrical equipment.
Another check for a little over 200,000 pesos was sent by the city council to a woman named Lorena Guadalupe Camachova Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid in the second half of this year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical equipment to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the municipality, this last check, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued for the amount of 200,144.56 pesos and its subject was "settlement of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay the supplier, who was being monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional amount.
What's not being said is the total amount the city owes her and how many more checks will be sent in favor of Camachía Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what is owed to her is paid to her, as to the other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last one on November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the Treasurer assured that she had not re-used the services of the contractor of the City Hall.
More recently, after July 25, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the cheques issued by the city hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abela López Sánchez, the city of Camachova Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it cashed cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites are in dire need of maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sanchez Taboada mansion in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Sanchez Taboada gorge, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in a bad state and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Business Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the impression of the destination, and the bad impression that tourists find here, be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea of the sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have taken such matters so long and without proper planning".
Jose Ramón Manguart Sánchez, the hotelier, said the fall of tourists was caused by the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just fix existing defects", he said.
We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because we as residents deserve clean living quarters, the city council should change its strategy of city maintenance".
Other sites that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, include the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito.
"Today, to attract tourists, it is not just about promotion, but also about offering a good product, a city with clean beaches and streets, where the tourist attractions are constantly maintained", he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid here, and these facts highlight what is well known to all, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city council, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order, to make it attractive because it has tourism potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not being used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and sites, but it will first be necessary to put them in order to make these places attractive and to be able to include them in the list we have for the promotion of this destination".
The PI is asking Congress for results.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like the deputies to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in seeking better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
A parliamentary term of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in spasms and faces great problems.
Since yesterday the 60th parliamentary term has started, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 PAN members, three Partido Nueva Alianza members, two PRD members, one PT member, one Convergencia member and the last one PVEM member, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The expectations of new members of Congress are to be able to exercise good leadership, with commitments to society and to the various fields that require responsible legislative work, and not to repeat the same partisan and paternalistic patterns.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a lot of responsibility and set an example in the way of better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
That's why he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would move the ruling class forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be committed to the society and sectors first and foremost, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to join forces to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, that they create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation".
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the second-lowest budget ministry, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currency and investment, which moreover directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to spending money on start-up tourism projects, Congress should provide assistance to the state on security and help with the alcohol law that failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary terms.
The Three Kings are looking for each other
Dolls, carts and bicycles are among the other toys on the wish list of the children in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their dreams for the upcoming Three Kings Festival, as their household numbers exactly 12 people and one lamb.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Caspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest residence in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the plebeys on the street to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a wheel, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he's been wanting a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetano would like a year-old outfit.
"He (José Alfredo) said to me 'I wish I had this monster car', but I said 'we'll see you soon, son', because it was very expensive", Cayetano recalls with sadness.
For older children who were in school, it would be ideal clothing and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is short of sneakers, so he could use a size five and a half or a size six.
To help the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuela children come true, you can participate in the "The Three Kings Are Looking" campaign by bringing a gift or cash to the Noroeste reception desk.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday, in the course of the liquidation of a cannabis production and distribution network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The searches were made in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly at sites used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 barrels of cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used in the production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec City Police.
A total of 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to report to the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches followed a lengthy investigation lasting almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests", Ruel said.
The police operation involved 70 officers from the Estrie Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be allowed to continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says would regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, with all three opposition parties saying Wednesday they cannot support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet", declared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a bill that would allow for the detention of any person from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was headed toward the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do", said Mr Duceppe.
NDP critic Olivia Chow on the issue of immigration has rejected critics who say her party is not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that we should take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that's what we consider to be the core of another bill, C-35", Ms. Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and jails children for at least a year", explained Ms. Chow.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
"Canadians are telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it as some kind of pathologist".
They expect Canada to take action, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to vote to reject it.
One Conservative told QMI that the government will call for a vote so that any MP who is against will be held accountable to their constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to keep the idea alive: Quebec is planning to consult with the Department of Investigation in New York on the issue as early as January next year.
The Metropol has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise to many of us.
It should be noted that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Council of Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
It took little more than the PQ's public security critic Stéphane Bergeron to describe the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "an amateur solution fucked up on its knees".
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future of unity.
"Satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it".
"We are aware of the problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr Charest is determined not to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I do, that he is hiding something", he explains.
"The only way to get the commission of inquiry is to have Jean Charest resign", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
To resolve this impasse, he proposed that Quebec grant special powers to the inspector general to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the inspector general's mandate", he decided.
He also thinks that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, which would allow him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal on the Charest government's files.
Quebec would also like Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it more appropriate for this type of crime.
This request would have been based on the authorised representative for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his colleague from the Judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently reviewing some of the amendments associated with this brief.
Operation Spring 2001, which targeted a biker gang, despite the fact that the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, resulted in the arrest of 131 people.
Ottawa subsequently had the Gangster Act amended.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several waterways have been brought under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
There was another landslide this evening in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bumpy.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. rainfall from 40 to 70 millimeters.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected between today and Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were hit the hardest.
It could drop a hundred millimeters in total.
If we add these precipitations to the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear flooding for some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière on Wednesday night.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and in Chêne, in the Lotbinière, have been subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall caused the drainage of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was destroyed by heavy rains.
Two residences have been evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spilling of some lakes from the banks has caused the closure of some roads, particularly in the communes of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is on alert and is monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre issued severe flood warnings for several rivers, especially the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly blaming
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians, as well as for using profanity on the air.
The Broadcasting Board of Governors found that Mr. Dupont and his group at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some of the statements included "incorrect information about social assistance and inappropriate negative depictions of Haitians, rude language that does not correspond to a broadcast broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that discussions of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took their own lives, did not violate the rules for broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasts aired between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Social Benefits Front.
The group complained that the amounts given in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, the host, Stéphane Dupont, felt that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission finds that the contentious episodes of the Dupont midday news "have dealt with a sensitive subject in an impartial and appropriate manner".
No charges have been brought against him.
The last dispute was over a statement that followed the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort have thus engaged in a media firefight which has provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said that he didn't send any donations to help the Haitians because we can't be sure that the needy are actually getting the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of the Haitian people.
"I've already made up my three-day deposit on that thing".
"My file has been untouched for a year and a half", the presenter declared.
In all its decisions, the Commission refuses to use broadcasting terms of abuse.
In any case, CHOI-FM cooperated "beyond its responsibilities".
For a station which will have to notify these decisions once during its main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
The king of the kung fu of Montreal.
A resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely peculiar temperament.
An athlete who excels in kung-fu, kickboxing and Thai boxing enters tatami and rings all over the world looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008, explained, "to learn from professionals".
"In my case, I look for fights pretty much everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game that comes with combat sports, North American competitions are rare".
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as a helper for the UPS company, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World San Shou Cup in China".
"The contestants who finished in the top four at the last world championships in each category were invited".
"I won bronze at the 2009 Toronto Olympics".
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"I finished fifth in the 2007 China, while I finished third in the 2009 Toronto", he added.
"The interesting thing is, in every competition, I've made some progress".
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China, where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are permitted.
Traditionally, matches are played on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this form of combat is Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
As Nacer Zemmal has only one goal to keep his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China", explains a nice guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, analyzing".
"There are four competitors in each weight class (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their respective category".
"The winners of each category will then compete to crown the only champion, the king of kung-fu".
450million without public tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to a $450 million contract with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has been awarded the most important contract, the contract to manage the entire project, totalling 295 million dollars, without public tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was mandated in 2004 along with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium of Énergie gérance was awarded a lucrative contract without any call for tenders.
The Quebec party's complaint against a consortium of companies presents us with a serious ethical problem which risks excluding competition and causing price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition".
"This means that people no longer make side agreements in secret, they are now making them openly", PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr Simard asked the National Assembly this question because he says it's hard to see how the public interest can be sold like this.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, vehemently denying that the contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way", she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked punctuality".
She said it was "the least we could do" to have PQ apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice around the world.
It is usually a temporary alliance which allows two or more undertakings to pool their expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scope of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be rolled out by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the engineering consulting consortium is the subject of a government investigation.
If we fly through the business register of Quebec, we can discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created on a regular basis.
Dessau is thus in partnership with most of its main competitors; CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult, to name a few.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that's Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau emphasised in particular that 'the Baie James region is characterised by a special labour force dynamic, to which Hydro-Québec has been responding since the 1970s'.
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation which forced us to face the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you're going to a public tender and if there are few bidders, your bids may be higher".
"You have two choices: you can pick the people who are in the contract as the bidders, and you can say, 'Let's make a satisfactory deal and a good price.'
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that is important, but the competence of the people", Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts worth over $50,000 received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded to Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir identified 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratories, that carried out analyses of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin obtained 22 contracts, of which Génivar obtained 16 contracts, Tecsult 14 contracts and Dessau 10 contracts without holding a stake in Energy Management.
All the contracts were closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Énergie Gérance.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are 'very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec'.
Minister Normandeau omitted to say that PQ is also linked to the companies that "finance" it, before clarifying that it is more about its executive staff.
Barometer of responsible consumption - the 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in 'neutral' brands and environmental certifications to guide his product choices.
The worst part is that even though we buy into a media universe that urges us to be more socially responsible in our consumption, this media universe bemoans the lack of credible information, the failure to comply with obligations that even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first article was published yesterday.
Even though the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still don't have much faith in them.
In fact, two-thirds of us say that we don't trust companies' environmental promises, simply because the green advertising of companies is measured by a measuring tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, according to Barometre.
Similarly, the debate on the issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumption information seems to be the primary way of stimulating this aspect of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barometer has identified, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebecers are skeptical of the green products or services we're looking to pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products in response to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them preferred to shop at local merchants and preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the recycling king, seeking to minimize its impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience has clearly remained outside their cars, Baromètre reports: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or recommend using a car for at least two people to protect nature.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large-scale behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Quebec government, which we asked to participate financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which had sought a grant of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which had proved its mission as a lover of the art of cinema, had not obtained what it had asked for.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than an expected gift, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some initial expectations were that it could lay the foundation for a viable solution of benefit on favourable terms and with resources coming from the State.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests had already been revised downwards.
The proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister for Culture, François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), which is managing the eXcentris cinema project.
The last message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond to the request.
However, it seems that the state-sponsored hypothesis really must be rejected.
It should be recalled that the Association of Cinemas and Cinématographiques in Quebec opposed direct State investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, on the grounds that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project concerning real estate if he had not done so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the debate demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got the premises of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the change by the state finance board.
The lack of independent movie theaters is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, is campaigning to free up funds for the private sector, in the belief that they will save $700,000 to pay for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three theaters on February 27 next year and showcase Xavier Beauvois's most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not reminded Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are made to him.
The curtain is lifted on Canada as a whole...
New US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as a complex of Canadian inferiority to Americans, but at the same time expresses a sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter has Canadian-American relations at heart when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its 2009 budget!
Four new cables, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, were leaked to the public yesterday, providing additional sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
Much to the amazement of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost inexhaustible, conditions possible political leaders to talk about internal stakes, instead of realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988) ", he writes.
"The United States is thus", he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better the party leader to manage these important relationships should be the key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls".
Another expression of this sense of urgency can be found in a message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help secure the government's survival in a confidence vote early February on the federal budget, which Canada will publicly acknowledge its first deficit in more than a decade, for a $30-$40 billion recovery plan", writes M. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to cancel the pre-Christmas session of parliament to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties are conditioning their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image CBC dramatic series are casting on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which have been observed to contain not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the No-Fly-List or even to abductions for the purpose of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Another report says that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe was prepared to take in some of the Guantanamo detainees.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed some papers to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary accepted on the condition that she would review the file".
Finally, let's note that the WikiLeaks people are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, has stated on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
Word got out, and Mike Huckabee in the States heard about it.
The World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renovate residential, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve GHG reductions, which is almost one third of the additional limit needed to stabilize the planet's climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the process of being developed into large concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancun to compensate for the absence of hard-to-achieve reduction commitments by industrialised countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolise 50 to 70 percent of the market, with fluorescent or, better yet, LED light bulbs, a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons of GHG emissions on the planet caused by lighting would be eliminated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the entire car fleet on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with significant emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will take another 5 Gt to stabilize global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to rule out that it doesn't get out of control.
In a burning light bulb, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5% is produced by light.
With fluocompact light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED light bulbs, we'll reduce that consumption by half.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs that Philips is rolling out this week - the company was reportedly involved in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a light bulb, giving us a sense of the potential savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with the rheostats and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have raised concerns about fluorocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection sites.
However, the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent bulb but rather thermal coal power plants, which release much of the mercury needed to produce electricity that is wasted in the burning bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would derive from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year in electricity and 8 million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost $2.5 billion to build.
The Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for immediate release of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay", the UN president's spokesman stressed.
"It requests all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the deadline of Wednesday midnight to pass without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls spread around the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Gbagbo's camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "underwater" voting in the north, which has been run by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Ivory Coast's presidential campaign director, confirmed that the FN's (New Army) intimidation tactics in the north of the country had discouraged the Ivory Coast's president's supporters from going to vote.
The elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council heeded the complaint filed by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links to the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but not to go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential elections, taking place on Sunday, was seen as the culmination of a process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in half for years.
The United Nations warned the Cote d'Ivoire political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote, against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter.
The International Labour Office (ILO) unemployment rate in France remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas regions), according to provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The unemployment rate has stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolitan area.
The second quarter figures were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including the overseas regions.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 percentage point.
In the wider context, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but would like to work, regardless of whether they are available to work in two weeks' time and regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market today was further exacerbated by a new increase in the unemployment rate, which reached 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637,000 unemployed young people aged 15 to 24.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in one year), i.e. 482 000 people aged 50 and over and 6.6% including overseas regions.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics, reporting on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and remanded in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste treatment companies and brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône administration, was charged and imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misappropriation of company property, misappropriation of public funds and public property, withholding, giving bribes, accepting bribes in order to influence the authorities and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a militant and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not some delusions".
"It's easy to prosecute him for a lot of criminal reasons, but it's another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr. Guérini, through his lawyers, stated that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his hearing to clarify the situation.
One of his closest confidants, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the landfills he was supposed to be fixing.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he had never known anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and has released the protagonists of the case under a restraining order.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation for all the facts alleged against him".
"The investigating judge will take this into account and let him go free", said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released Tuesday night, with two of them still on probation, said Assistant District Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misuse of company property", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misappropriation of the company's assets".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of helping launder money from a vast gangster operation.
The investigation is being conducted in the framework of several judicial investigations opened against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste matter.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from some towns in the Marseille Metropolitan Community (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: the Elysee Palace has overplayed its role in mediating Syria
Over more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has brought France's public opinion together, put diplomacy on alert, and highlighted relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is being closely watched by U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not a trade-off for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the US justice system for fraudulently trafficking in materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they bring to light the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything about it.
Diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, entitled 'Iran: French comments on the way the hostage situation is being handled'.
The Elysee Palace's strategic adviser, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking to the US diplomat, Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They are urging Americans to do the same for their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "continuously and forcefully pronounce" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "imminent liberation".
We need to bring the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, to the brink.
"Do it more often, the more they ask you to stop".
Because attempts to negotiate through discreet channels "silence solves nothing", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier points out that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purpose of 'political blackmail'.
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day she is granted asylum by the French Embassy) 'will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' (€230,000 bail).
And he announces that the Elysee Palace anticipates hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians "could arrest some 1,800 more French nationals living in Iran in the future", it says.
The 28th of August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she remains locked up in Iran.
Word spreads: Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man the United States says was deported for illegally trafficking sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The American Embassy, as well as many observers, are questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material destined for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed to negotiate?
Liberating an Iranian for the liberation of a young French girl?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he says, was not only "shocked by the judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There were talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysée Palace adviser dials the number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris in buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy".
During the imprisonment of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "escapes" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing the "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blessing" of French officials.'
What is the basis of such a measure of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their boastful declarations, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The documentary then goes on to discuss the reasons that have forced the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 'was seen by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved'.
By "overstating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria what a praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "soften the spine of the conflict between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy has it on very good authority.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we still thanked them".
"At the very least, it should cause confusion and uncertainty among Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée Palace.
The communique thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their 'active role in the liberation of our country'.
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government is set to pass a law called "Pecival", which will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, according to government officials.
A bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to people under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty in school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day".
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, a senior official in the ministry responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, added the official in charge.
It will also make available free programs to people who request them, to help them limit the amount of time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and daily press reports regularly report various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competition.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: FIFA selects the host nation for the 2018-2022 FIFA World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in the United States from November 1 to December 31, 2018.
Full of unrest over suspected corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday set the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host country as a supremely politically motivated selection, where the battle of influence and lobbying risk outpacing technical criteria.
The fact is that the 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional home of the sport (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its debut on the African continent in 2010, or continue to expand into the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities attending the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of economic and political stakes across the world.
The backroom negotiations risk drawing to a close.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
The Commission notes that the Spanish authorities have not provided any evidence that would support the argument that the measure is not selective.
But those reasons won't carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for the vote.
The Sunday Times's early revelations leading to the suspension of two EC members for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of their cradle-kicked country, which has so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC crowned it on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinned" three influential CE members: Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and embarrass the English leading man with David Cameron in the front row.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move of his predecessor in office, Tony Blair, who in 2005 won London the 2012 Olympic Games.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new lease of life with the EC?
Nothing is less certain, as the Spanish-Portuguese duo will not be short of the trophies of their already-prepared stadiums, their ownership (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give those ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a rhetorical reference barely twisted to blame the English press for the members of the EC.
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them", Mr. Putin declared.
The United States, with its considerable experience since 1994, seems to be the logical favourite for 2022.
The world's top economic powerhouse, the home of FIFA's main sponsors, this country seems to have a big head start on Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have come up with a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for the two countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa is eager to win, has made the Asian 2022 chances null and void.
Qatar, which has pulled a big ace out of the sleeve in the shape of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries pose more risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the meager TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, which is the driving force for FIFA.
The second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitating.
Mitterrand has made it seem like he's hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less so.
The mandate to the Elysian Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in keeping with the amount of secrecy associated with the presidency.
So we have to act as if the doubts are constant.
In one sense and in another.
In 2006, beyond belief, friends of Jacques Chirac were demanding that a third term be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured with a serious expression that "a decision will be made sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded the UMP members of parliament in the Elysee Palace on Wednesday evening, the prospect of "two mandates" has spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution reduced the number of five-year terms to two.
It was a statement from him, not a statement.
It's not the first time he's used a humorous tone in meetings like this to refer to the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you have another seven and a half years with me", he said in July 2009.
May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage".
His statements the day before do not make him any more than the day before; they do not make him any less than the day before.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to PS candidacy, on page one.
But it is not the entrance to the tomb of Ségolène Royale that is pressuring Nicolas Sarkozy to confess.
It's because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want a combat placement premature rather than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, voters on the right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this with the UMP", people from the prime minister's immediate entourage responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, settled with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank in the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the halt of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt is a serious problem and the securities market will no doubt be unable to take such a firm stance in the face of the deterioration of the already tense situation on European securities markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in helping to resolve the European sovereign debt crisis.
She declined to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond-buying programme.
'I am writing to my European partners (...) '.
The evening before, in Brussels, during his inquiry by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent about his intentions, and contented himself with saying that the programme of purchasing government bonds on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will keep its base rate at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the European Central Bank's bond buybacks doubled in the last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And thanks to the market's foolishness, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have bought up EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no room for doubt between the market participants in the anticipation of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists are not expecting any major change in the course either.
If the European Central Bank has no longer in its arsenal any lending operations for a period exceeding three months, the latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity on generous terms and for periods of between one week and three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule in any significant way".
"If not, it would be risking short-term new tensions", says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
'The progressive approach announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely', predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
This is Oppenheim.
In addition to its intervention plan in the public debt market, 'the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to revive a languishing market', adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It needs to make up for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to avoid a flare-up of payments by the most vulnerable countries", a prominent bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be more concerned about reducing their debt than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is backing down.
After a start to the week that was worrying for Italy, the situation has eased a bit, with the 10-year bond yields backflowing yesterday.
A return to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the presidents of the regions said they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which the participants then denied.
In any case, on Tuesday the deviation from long German interest reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs soared to 263 points, causing some uproar in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, has said he's "too busy" with "the turbulent market" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of fiscal input, which go hand in hand and expose the state to the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against the government's 3.9% forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new summary of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of € 7 billion.
"If necessary, new tough measures will have to be taken", said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been saying this for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors under Italian pressure on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product in 2011), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections could be organised, which are expected to take place at the end of March.
This would open a period of unfavourable decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde emphasized this again yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although all relative, yesterday's record expansion in interest rates on European government bonds brought water to the mill for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target of the most intense speculation.
"Because in May, the real is a lack of transparency and transparency policy, relying mainly on banking systems", states economists Exane BNP Paribas.
Moreover, "political time is slower than market time".
Acknowledging this disconnect and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most concerned and their G20 counterparts are proceeding very well.
With the Eurogroup and Ecofin meeting starting early next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
The fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets is on the agenda (see above).
As for the European Stability Fund (ESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, embarked on a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of the journey is not to raise funds, it is to prepare the ground for that aim.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds through additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The main countries concerned, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards labour market organisation.
Reforms that are coupled with strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different route from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are determined to avoid, at all costs, seeking international assistance before they have applied their own budgetary adjustments and decided on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, equity participants in European funds are talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber suggested that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-examine its stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the first-ever player in the European sovereign debt business, believe that an additional €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct financial liquidity provision.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been endowed to date with EUR 60 billion.
A system that has every chance of being tested in the capitals of Europe.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties on orange alert.
The snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-snow-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so
Twenty-four counties are now in orange alert for snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that have already declared an orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is causing problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and light snow in the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, places of 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover of 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of the Basse-Normandie, the Ile-de-France and the Limousin are concerned.
Snowfall is large enough to cause problems in transportation and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods vehicles - trucks over 7.5 tonnes - along the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Traffic on secondary roads in Brittany is very difficult according to the police and the police recommend to drive your vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks was canceled for that day.
In Picardy, school assemblies were banned on Thursdays.
No special measures are foreseen to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office "calls on all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10% at Orly airport on Thursday due to the expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air services contact their air carrier.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris Metro: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, it's raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to get this project started, the State announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that would allow SGP to use part of its dual source funding for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the first amendment.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which the National Assembly's Finance Committee is considering this morning, contains mechanisms designed to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
First, as we read in the text of the bill, Article 15 reads 'in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It is numbered: "The interest income from this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is to restructure the existing office rate 'in order to modernise it, to increase the profit it generates and to affect Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that be?
The delusion.
It's not numbered in the text.
We're four billion away.
'It is specified that these fiscal resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of capital injections that will be mobilised by the State and invested in the Société du Grand Paris under the project', the explanatory memorandum reads.
To us at SGP, this system doesn't seem shocking.
"Once we've generated revenues, we can fund studies for three years and then rake in $4 billion", he explains.
"It will be budgeted and used as needed".
SGP considers that the 4 billion will be credited only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion belongs to the absent subscribers, risks triggering a rather heated parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on December 7th.
The vengeful hackers and the sensitive spies
The WikiLeaks case is two-fold.
On the one hand, there is the obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it's a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service of any nation consists entirely of press cuts.
The Americans' "extraordinary revelations" about Berlusconi's sex life are what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all but the two Berlusconi's own), and the unflattering caricature of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches by cabaret artists.
The rule that classified documents can only consist of news already known is crucial to the dynamics of intelligence, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore that specializes in esoteric literature, you will find that each work (of the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) repeats exactly what has already been written in the previous works.
Not only is the author of occult texts reluctant to seek new information (or to know where to look for information about nonexistent things), but those who practice the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same is true of classified documents.
The informer is a lazy, and lazy (or narrow-minded) head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor at the newspaper Libération), who only believes what he himself admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the US Embassy sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek had published a week earlier.
So why was there such a fuss about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly out to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows full well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly discredits the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most highly classified information from the most powerful country in the world is a severe, if not a significant, blow to the prestige of this government department.
Scandal affects both the victims and the "perpetrators".
But let's move on from that to the deep truth of what happened.
Back in the days of Orwell, it was possible to grasp all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been proven since, with the ability to control every move made by a phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, every highway used, and so on, the citizen has become a total victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it is now, that even the tombs with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- chosen as the citizen's avenger -- can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power hold out when it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel said that a true secret is a secret without a secret (and a secret without a secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret without a secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were secrets without a secret, is to deprive him of all power.
WikiLeaks did not do anything wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but they did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the power so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be the equivalent of putting it on a billboard on a street corner.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technology it is unrealistic to hope that a phone message can be kept secret.
There's nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state was on a plane and connected with any of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future ?
I know that my prognosis is science fiction at the moment, and therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are discreetly transporting the formalities of uncontrollable routes, carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather conceal valuable information in the heel of their shoes.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-locked sockets: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on telephone wires.
Video cassettes (analogue) allowed moviegoers to shoot a film step by step, moving it back and forth and revealing all the secrets of the montage, whereas CDs (numerical) now allow only chapter jumps, that is, macro-squares.
By express train, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while the plane ride, including the transportation, takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communications technology are reverting to horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was going on in the embassy's secret compartment.
Now it's the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the progress of the pledges of developed countries to unlock fast-start financing.
And the great French hacks have been uncovered
In the Cologne Accord, the advanced countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out the big one to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operation, invaluable and appreciated for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has committed EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver its promise of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the details, things are much more complicated.
These funds are 'new and additional' under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is realised without prejudice to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, each of you will choose the reference that best suits you.
The European Commission, for example, took 2009 as a reference year: international funding was maintained and it added 150 million for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France considers that the funding of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words,there is no reference to previous period expenditure or to the global level of Public Aid for Development (Aide publique au développement).
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even be reduced) in order to comply with its commitment to finance 'new and additional' measures.
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, think that 1 euro borrowed equals 1 euro donated.
Obviously, it's hard to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments which are profitable (often these are projects linked to the reduction of emissions, based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present the one euro we receive as the equivalent of the one euro we give... We should not understand it in terms of our obligations, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent interest rate).
But France can only provide this justification: it "honors" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91,5% is a loan (EUR 389,8 million) and 8,5% a donation (EUR 36,1 million) - see the EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are keeping their 100% donation commitments.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union puts in 1 euro to meet its pledge, France only puts in 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A lovely piece of skittle!
In summary, France's 'fast start' financing is based on two tricks: on the one hand, on the time evolution of the action and, on the other, on the real financial burden.
Although it only spends €36.1 million, it can convince you that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both inside the EU (why would member states continue to donate when they can only lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But she could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France should announce a change in its accounting practices for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its commitments and of fairness and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing the contribution of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not avoid the question of 'additionality' or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France should change its attitude to become as progressive with these deposits as with the others.
So, all hope is placed on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancún next week.
The surprise announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alert regarding pesticides that children ingest.
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study released this Wednesday by the Future Generations Association.
The association, which points out that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the problematic area", bought between July and September food normally consumed in four meals and one light meal as a snack per child of about ten years in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, which include the official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sugar confectionery, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are considered to be carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are considered to be carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances that could act as a disruptor to the endocrine glands (EDs), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our research clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/ or PE is staggering", states the association.
Breakfast butter and milk tea alone contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, cited in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicidal agent banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in the lunch, which have been tested for traces of potent insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, ground beef steaks, canned tuna, and even goose and gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water was tested for nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues found, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not escape analysis.
The study concludes that the final risk to consumers of this 'cocktail of contaminants' is likely to be underestimated.
The Ecological Europe-Green (EE-LV) group proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the rise of civilization diseases" in "the face of an emergency".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the state of residue of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of them in cereals.
