Welsh AMs concerned about 'looking like a bunch of idiots'
Some AMs are opposed to the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament)
It arose due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum worry that it could invite ridicule.
A Labour AM said their group was worried, it is sung with Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: twp in Welsh means daft and pwp means poo.
A PLAYED AM said that the whole group was not happy and suggested changes.
A Welsh Conservative said their group was "open-minded about the name change", but noted that it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English U
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Any final decision on which workers are called to the Assembly becomes a matter of their membership.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal that the Assembly had received broad support for convening a Welsh parliament.
In the case of the title of AMs, the Commission supported the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
The AMs are clearly suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may be difficult for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, who hopes to submit draft legislation on the change within weeks.
The reforms law will include further changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules on the design of the incompetence of the AM and the committee arrangements.
When they debate the law, they will get the final vote on the question of what they should be told.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
A public vote was set up to resolve Greece's decades-long dispute over whose province is called Macedonian.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to one of its territories and has repeatedly objected to its membership bills for the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov has told the opposition to the referendum on the basis of a name change that he will ignore the vote
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Jorn Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
Bells of St. Martin fall silent in churches in Harlem Struggle
Mr. Adams said, "Historically, the old people I have spoken to have said that there was a bar and a church at every corner.
There is no one here today.
He said that the 12th is in extinction.
He said, "People nowadays socialize in a different way".
Bar is no longer the neighborhood living room where people go regularly
For the churches he worries that there will be no money from selling property unless the leaders have hope, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started
He said that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings where they are filled with people who have not helped the rest of the shelters in the neighborhood.
Many of the people who buy condominiums in those buildings will become white, and so soon the day will come when these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who go to these condominiums will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by whites before becoming St. Martin's, a black metropolitan metropolitan community in Harlem in the 1870s.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's
A group of blacks who worshiped nearby took over the building
St. Martin's was occupied by a group of black men under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's pastor, planning to rebuild, appointed Carillon
The Rev. David Johnson, Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called Carlin "the bell of the poor"
The expert who played Carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a durable historical tool".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also notes that the world's first carillon was played by a black musician, Denisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church's large carillon 18 years ago.
Shri Maribhidar said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been playing out in St. Martin over the last few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Viceroy.
The vice-regal, composed of the Leigh leaders, expressed concern in the Vestre - the governing body of Paris - with the desire to pass the vice-regal to the Vestre with costs, even though Vestre was not involved in recruiting buildings and contractors sent to the vice-regal.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the province
13-year-old injured by shark attack on Lobster dive in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place just before 7pm near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWT-T in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then pedalled with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was a lot of enthusiasm to catch a lobster, but then he "felt like he was screaming, 'I've learned a little!'
I learned a little!
His whole beard was open after the cut", Hamal said when he saw the boy once.
"I warned everyone to get out of the water", Hamel said. "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was taken to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles, speaking briefly to a media, said that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was definitely not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim's injuries to his upper limb area
The authorities have stopped the passage of the Sumandari coast from Kasablad to Ponto Beach in Swami's Ektas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous
Sainsbury's plans entered the UK beauty market.
Snesbury is taking department store-style beauty aesthetes such as boots, superdrugs and dabinhams that are working with specialist assistants.
As part of a significant capital increase in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which is growing steadily as fashion and homeowner sales return, large beauty azles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful, will be brought to more stores next year.
Investing in beauty once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware comes as a supermarket hunt for ways to use shelf space.
Sensbury said it will double the size of its beauty line to 3,000 products, including Revlon, SC, Twigerman and Dr. PawPaw (Pow Paw) for the first time.
The existing categories from L'Oreal, Mabelline and Burt Bees will get more space with branded areas like those found in shoe shops.
The supermarket is re-launching its boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly - sometimes sought after by small shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer fragrance shop Sainsbury's is exploring concessions at two stores that opened last week in Croydon, south London, while a second one in Sewing Oak, Birmingham, is due to open later this year.
A shift towards online shopping and smaller daily purchases at local convenience stores means that people will have to do more to convince themselves to visit supermarkets.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Kapee has said outlets will quickly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight against Discount L.D. and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced several homes after buying both girls two years ago which is said to have boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous attempts to improve the supermarket's beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but lost a tie-up on how to distribute its medicines in its supermarkets at its registry stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Celesio for £125m three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by combining a wide range of luxury leather brands including La Roche-Pose and Medium in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director, Sunsbury said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty azuls to increase reach for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our brand range is tailored to meet every need and eco-friendly and convenient locations mean we are now at a magnificent beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Wilfby pulls out of $11 million deal
Dragon's Day star Peter Jones pulls out an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to leave 'Angry' to TV presenter Holly Willisby to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
WillyBaby doesn't really have time for his household goods and truley brand
This business pair was merged with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, Vakta, 37, announced his departure on Instagram
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Dan star Peter Jones in his final season to focus on his new bumper contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at her business empire's headquarters in the Buckinghamshire town of Marlow on Tuesday that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to dedicate to her home appliances and accessories brand Truli.
The business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was asked to double Willibee's estimated £11 million fortune.
As for Willibee (37), she announced on Instagram that she is leaving the Truly brand, with Jones having gone out of England for one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly, the top of the slowdown priorities was at the top.
It was going to look at her long-term future, which she would see over the next two decades.
The decision to evict the remaining residents was made
No one believed that what was happening on Tuesday was so close to starting.
Marlowe headquarters has a full warehouse ready for sale.
Experts believe that the presenters of this morning, who are among the most trusted stars in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and are likely to have further delays in its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willaby and husband Don Baldwin, Jones and his wife Tara Cappe have been together for nearly ten years
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couple vacationing together and Jones owns 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm
WiliffB has become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlen as ITV's ISA celebrity
A source close to Jones said he "would not comment on his business affairs".
We had difficulty communicating and then we fell in love.
He joked about some media commenting on "anonymity" and criticism that considered the North Korean leader to be positive.
Why has President Trump given such a priority?
Trump says his mockery in the voice of "news anchor"
"I left nothing behind".
He noted that since Kim was interested in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, Trump moved towards North Korea denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks were closed.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top ambassador, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN the General Assembly said on Saturday that the North was not seeing "an adequate response" from North America to North Korea's initial demilitarization steps.
Instead, he noted, the US has continued sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump brings another optimistic perspective in his rally speech
He said "we are doing very well with North Korea",
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions have been killed
Now we have these enhanced relationships.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning home to save American troops.
And he would save his unusual attitude in talking about his relationship with Kim.
It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this packaged battlefield, we have about 200 people standing here, pointing directly at the crowd, Trump said,
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed
Although 10 percent of the population of Lamback had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for generating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have become very clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Ms. Sumung said.
While a team is forming to travel to Palu to rescue the children, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
The National Disaster Agency spokesman, Mr. Sutopo said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief.
The land is being given to the land that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is suffering greatly from natural disasters
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ash, they are not a common sight on other coasts
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was in effect, is unlikely to contribute to the loss of life.
In good times, traveling through many Indonesian countries is challenging
Natural disasters complicate the logistics
A hospital ship is being deployed in Lamback to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's flat infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has extorted money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joco's administration as he contends for re-election next year.
Mr. Joco also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority are adopting a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim groups clashed in the streets using batons, arrows and other crude weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool's Deep Equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League defeat by Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London
Sturridge was passed over by Sachin Shakiri while he was scoring with his team to 30 yards of the Golden Trophy.
He would tap the ball on his left before taking a shot to the back
This effort rose above the box as it moved to the right corner of the net.
The ball was eventually kicked into the net by a coupé from Arizabalanga.
"It was just trying to get in that position, being on the ball and players like Shak always play it as far as possible, so I tried to make myself as much time as possible", Struridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the fork coming and I made a touch and didn't think much about it and just shot it.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker passed Mateo Kovacic on that play, before scoring close to the metaphor and entering the Liverpool half.

The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Agency spokesperson Satio Poorvo Nagroho, addressing a news conference, said that many people were trapped in the collapse of buildings hit by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and agents spokesperson Satio Poorvo Nagroho said.

Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder of a woman with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a knife wound at 7.55am on Grazen Mouse on Jorne Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police appealed to people in those areas to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area at Burnham to contact us".
I would appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have captured anything on the dashcam photo to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.'
Police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrive at the scene to ask questions about where she met this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mouse has recently tried to go to his home although no one is being told by police to enter or leave the building.
When he realized what had happened, he was stunned.
The residents are being told that they will not be allowed to return for a long time.
A police officer was heard saying that the entire area is now seen as a crime area.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
She repeatedly says that 'It is terrible'.
At 2 pm two police vans were parked inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers stood within the cordon to inspect the blocks of flats.

The statue of the Parliament of Comwell became the latest monument to 'rewrite history'.
This dismissal would be in justice for their criticism of the social and religious heritage of England as a vast tradition created by the higher Panchayat Scheduled Castes like the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Sunsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current discussion about the removal of statues it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The English Civil Wars statue was neither commissioned nor completed by Cromwell.
Cromwell sacrificed for the activities of the Ancestor Thomas in the last century
Sir William Humphrey Thorncroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century opinion and history of a painting that many believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being consulted by many in his monarchical affairs, as a protection of Parliament from outside pressure, in the late 19th century than today.
Even if this is a perfectly accurate representation, it is a subject to be moved forward with a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the war of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Crowwell is an individually identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance".
Killer pig mole killed Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that the man identified only by his surname "Yuan" was found dead in a market in Lipansui, Guizhou province, with a severe arterial wound, which was bloodstained.
A pig farmer was vaccinating pigs in a pig pen in Xining, Qinghai province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came from the neighboring region of Greece with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and a neighbor found a door to open the pig pen.
He said that there was a large male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a legal investigation confirmed that 550-pound pigs killed the farmer.
My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised, according to the Guangyang Evening News, his cousin referred to him by his nickname "Wu"
Security camera footage showed Yuan had gone to the market to feed his pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was not of John or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was stopped from attacking another person, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the individual to sustain serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig rode a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife drove him away.
In 2012 an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not particularly aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just getting excited.
They are nervous, curious... they are not out to harm you.
You need to put them in the right way", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern US.
As a forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it is over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Roza will bring flooding to northern Mexico and southwestern US in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had winds of 85 mph at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 meters southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Expect to go north of the equator on Sunday
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is taking shape overhead and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rossa makes landfall in California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push the deep tropical storm north, into the northern Southwestern United States.
Rosa will add up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the combination of tropical humidity with the Ushchakantbandhi humidity will lead to heavy rainfall in the south-western region in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous frosty flooding, debris runoff and potential landslides in the desert.
The hot tropical humidity will cause rainfall especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona to reach rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour.
2 to 4 inches rainfall expected in parts of southwest especially Arizona
Due to the scattered flow of tropical rain, flooding with deteriorating conditions is likely to occur soon.
It is very useless to advise to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of heavy rain.
Heavy rainfall could cause the valley to become a flood plain, and local winds and dust would be blown away by thunderstorms.
The imminent trophy will bring some locally heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast
Rainfall of half an inch is possible, which will reduce debris flow and cause slip on roadway.
This will be the first rainfall of that summer season.
Some scattered remnants of the Ushnkhundi Moosle-based rain will reach Arizona before Monday on Sunday and, before that, rain will become more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and Wednesday will be the last day.
Temperatures may drop somewhat over the Americas in October as the Arctic cools, although summer weather remains very warm.
Sometimes this indicates extreme changes in temperature over a short period of time.
Sunday is a prime example of the extreme temperature difference across the focal US.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, efforts will be made to build and re-expand the summer heat.
Most of Central and Eastern America is expected to see the start of summer in early October, which is in the Northeastern states, which saw the start of summer in the 80s.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be ten degrees above average.
Our long-term environmental forecast is showing a high probability of being better than temperatures forecast by the main part of October in the eastern U.S.
Brent Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by over 20 million people
The lead by Supreme Court nominee Brent Kavanaugh and the woman who accused Christine Blasey Ford of sexually abusing her in the 1980s was watched by more than 20 million people on the Six Television Network on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: The Arizona Senate drafted a contract with the FBI to investigate for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavan Howe, who was intoxicated, caught him and tried to undress him at the secondary school party.
Kavanhoun said in a passionate testimony that he is 100 per cent certain that this did not happen.
It is possible that more than 20.4 million people watched it as reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The organisation was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has often had difficulty estimating the people who look in the offices.
To put it in that perspective, the number of viewers is similar to a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose celebrity hosts heavily sponsored Kavanaugh's arrangement, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.8 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest remains high.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
The Moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, who was being watched by non-conformists on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he tried to ride the elevator in a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for a very short time with disappointment in his eyes as if he had been cursed by a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing here in front of you".
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have strength that other women do not have"
Flake said that his office had issued an announcement and said, before the elevator closes, he will have more to say in the committee.
Cable and broadcast networks were showing the entire program live after hours, when the Judiciary Committee voted to move forward with Kwanhao's nomination in the full Senate.
But Flex said they would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats are appealing.
Flake had participated in the discussion with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After consulting with the council and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flack's election had strength, as it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kwanhun without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kwan Hoon.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of being "political games" with Britain's future on leaving the European Union, and accused national interests of being undermined in a Sunday Times newspaper interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson repressed the attack on his so-called chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should have collected each other's tariffs was "completely vague".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Deaton Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting attack on 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that Deaton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on charges of second degree murder.
Officials showed video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, a CBS member reported to WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he was suspected of targeting Wade.
His bond has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer's reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The departments are assisting the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and the area's civilian investigation to make arrests.
LSU Athletic Head Joe Alevane thanked the area for "enforcing the law and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball advisor Wade said the team was "saddened" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanic fires raging over Mexico City
Lava from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after waves rising from the volcano's head and recording 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center was testing for thunder and lightning of many clouds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Zochimilco.
Geologists have seen an increase in activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that shook central Mexico in July 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after rioting pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and thousands of people joined protests to watch the main event of Catalonia's polarized vote.
A group of masked pro-separatists, dressed by terrified police, threw powder paint at them, shading the streets with black clouds of dust, which are usually filled with tourists.
There was also a handshake later in the day and the police used their guns to participate in the fight.
Citing "no mistake, no excuse" during the hours after independence, the union protesters shouted, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen individuals were treated for minor injuries in Assembly cases, the local press reported.
October is considered illegal by Madrid by popular mathematics but tensions remain high in the pro-independence area a year after it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters cast a large majority to become independent, although with the isolationists the voter turnout was small but the vote boycott is a large part of the vote.
According to Catholic officials, about 1000 people were injured last year after attempts to prevent voting at all polling stations in the region due to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out overnight on Friday to stop a demonstration in support of the national police.
The exhibition moved on but was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termas, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist radical's involvement, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's prospects of achieving independence.
Last year we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite narrow victories in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, pending their trial for their role in organizing a referendum in self-imposed exile or detention of several of their well-known leaders, and even after the next declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, protested on his phone in support of the police, saying that the struggle had been stopped by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", she said.
On Saturday, Olio Zuccoraz, who was one of nine Catalan pioneers to take part in the pre-start reforms facility since the end of last year, said he would fight for European parties next year.
Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the exception to democratic values and coercion, we have learned from the Spanish government", he said.
LONDON: Man arrested after car crashed into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a vehicle was repaired and thrown into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Ballinagar Crescent.
Death Inspector Bob Blemings said the door and building were damaged.
A car could be fired at on the side of a road.
Manga Straight won 1-0 from Livingston Rangers
Livingstone Menga's first round secured the win
Promoted Livingstone turned down Rangers' offer to hire Steven Gerrand, only his second loss in 18 games, as manager of the Iboroughs club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary's side went into second place with Hibranian.
Gerrard's side remain without success in the Premiership this season and lead the losing lead Hearts by 8 points the following Sunday.
Previously, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday
Livingstone, meanwhile, continues to move into the division for six games to extend his run, with head coach Holt having tasted defeat following the return of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed the opportunity of blunt tourists.
The Holt team should have progressed some time before scoring, the Rangers faced a lot of problems due to their obvious qualities.
Scott Robinson ended his efforts on his target at this time Alan Lithgow could only complete his task, after which he slid to target Craig Hockett's headline.
The hosts had the Rangers satisfied to play in front of them, and they knew they could upset the visitors in small parts.
And this was the way in which the important goal was achieved.
Rangers made a free-kick surrender and Livingstone made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga, who scored from a touchdown and box focal point.
At that stage, the Rangers had surrounded the property although they had found home security with difficulty and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely stable,
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended from Kelly.
Sickett Pittman deprived Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Leithgow of the foot by claiming to be blown off by a square from the Levenston set play.
Parr consistently came into the Livingstone box and kept playing it, while the two penalty claims - the substitute Glenn Middleton, and a helmet test for handball - were taken second.
'Authentic' from Livingstone - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony MacRoney Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingstone.
For a man, they were brilliant, pushing the desire this way up.
His style of play and players rarely change as he reaches the top, but still the credits need to be set aside for that team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcutt was marshaling the guard in a remarkably organized manner, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell on their feet.
The Rangers lacked motivation, however.
As they have been subjected to Gerard now and again, they have missed out on the lack of those standards.
Their last ball was a lack - they only cut home field in one inning - and it's a reminder for the Rangers that they got in the half-table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29), while the leaders of Turkey and Germany Vazão had breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by German President Erdogan - aimed at normalizing relations between NATO allies.
They have spoken on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's advancement to the European Union.
Erdogan then led Cologne to open a large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters rallied to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Andrew protesters - many of them Kurds - also heard his voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome his country.
The bilateral protest expression reflects the division of a visitor greeted as a hero by some German Turks and controlled by others

Long Laturin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot
Six prison officers injured in atmosphere of chaos at the high security correctional facility of men, the prison official has said.
The riot ended at HMP Long Latyn in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday.
Specialist "Torando" officers have been assembled to manage the situation, including eight prisoners and one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service representative said: Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and they can spend a long time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison representative was being treated in hospital after being attacked by the prisoner.
And in October a year ago, the noise-making officers were called to jail to deal with the serious situation in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It is unlikely that a tropical depression will hit Arizona, but it is likely to occur southwest of the desert as the remaining energy track of Hurricane Rosa moves in early next week, potentially causing flooding.
The National Weather Service has warned of possible flooding for western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, including urban areas of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah.
Roza may head for late rain on Monday and take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that a single "ten tropical cyclone-force winds have maintained hurricane or typhoon status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border of AZ".
Latest National Hurricane Center models forecast for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a variation of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim
Other areas of the desert southwest including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are expected to reach 1 to 2 inches, making possible a lower of 4 inches.
Out of the flammable danger, the daily rainfall could be a gift because these districts were arid
While flooding is a serious concern, a portion of this rainfall will likely be valuable as dry weather conditions are coming to the southwest at this time.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, less than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest classification, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads into the landfill across the California Peninsula rather than Mexico.
Rosa, still at sea storm quality on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is moving north at 12 mph at 385 mph from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is facing cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is slowly cooling down this way.
It is expected to landfill in Mexico with the force of Hurricane Sandy on Monday afternoon or evening.
Some parts of Mexico may experience very heavy rainfall, indicating a risk of a major flood.
"Weather.com reported that" rainfall from Baja California to northwest Sonora is expected to be 3 to 6 inches, with a potential of up to 10 inches. "
Rosa will track north into Mexico as a tropical storm, passing through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm.
The primary risk from heavy rainfall from or to the present is Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, "the National Hurricane Center said.
It is dependent on rainfall to cause dangerous flooding and debris flows in the desert and rock slides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four killers arrested
After the attempted murder of a 16-year-old in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
A teenage boy was found in a critical condition at around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Accelerator Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight from the Radstock area.
The officials have appealed for all those who have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kwan Hoon faced the "guilt, the hypocrisy, the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kwanhao is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's tactics of brutality and oppression", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kwanhoff "faced the Democratic Party's hype, anger" during his nomination process
Kwanhuff testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that dates back decades to when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at his indictment hearing
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the intelligence and the quality and the courage of Cavani that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the most capable legal confirmation of our time, a lawmaker with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly hinted at Kwan-ho's nomination, speaking about the importance of the Republican Party's vote in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
They said, "I'm not fighting, but I'm really fighting".
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere"
Trump argued that the Democrats' goal is to "opposite and obstruct".
The first main procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is likely to be after Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Indonesian earthquake, tsunami with hundreds killed, death toll rises
Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, killing at least 384 people, with huge waves washing away the coast, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves six meters (18 feet) high swept east in the evening, killing dozens and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they were hit", said a spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNBP in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, logs, houses, threw everything to the ground. Nagroho said the tsunami came at a speed of 800 km (497 mph) on the open sea before reaching the coast.
He said, some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were sent to 24 centers in the center of the city.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
After the shocks, the storm continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
An area of 2.4 million people felt the tremors.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It has been said that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami.
Ngoroh described the damage as "widespread", and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, some victims' bodies were found buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Ngururuho said the deaths and destruction occurred in the area called Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu on the seafront, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
"There was no information available due to the complete loss of contact with Dongla", said Ngorho.
More than 300,000 people are living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
It said, "It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
The agency was criticized for not reporting widely on Saturday that the tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves came in time and were reported earlier.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building hearing the screams of people standing in the street below warning of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami created a major force that cut off communications around Paulo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials have started sending the necessary aid in cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims still need more food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed till the end of October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami toll is now over 800.
This is bad.
Although Dongla's World Vision staff have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are taking refuge in the shelter of the trolls in their office yard, they pass disaster scenes along the way, said Mr. Doceba.
He said, "They told me that they have seen many destroyed houses.
This is bad.
Aid groups started their relief efforts with severe obstacles, with some complaining that the deeply experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from reaching the infected.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and staffing from abroad can only begin when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aliya Ariana, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster, we can get international help but there is no such situation yet.'
Like Friday night in Palo, the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of all the missing people hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that give the bleak stories of natural disasters their fill.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken down by a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been buried with her mother's body under the rubble for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendhon Subandono had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, who were hiding in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were some of his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Ganden said how the news of the collapse of the paragliding hotel spread among the people, he sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of the beach festival.
However their messages were as a result of gray checkmarks rather than blue checks.
He said "I think the messages were not delivered, sir"
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM re-run at Newport on Levi's
According to a report by the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from BRINX workers refilling ATMs at Levi's in Newport on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was clearing an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to take more money, Dat. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the paper.
When he was seized, another man "ran over the back of the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money held for delivery.
According to the report released, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to -Y.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He is commonly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used as the moniker for her eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was hoping to launch his new album, Yandy.
The producer of the show said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who was "cancelled for emotional reasons"
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'Y' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am, this is ours.
He left Canaan, which means that the only reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything is just a Jehu.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P.D.D or DD, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former Western colleague, Jay-Z, has also done one with or without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to refrain from using military force against civilians, as the country marches into the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Taltelco Plaza that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
The military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people as leftist students took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans who are studying and opening more free universities by offering monthly subsidies to those who are.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who works for Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said that as China becomes more agile in AI, the U.S. should double its spending on AI research.
AI policy has been announced following comments from various parts of the U.S. government, although there is a lack of a formal AI strategy in the U.S. as a whole.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, Li said.
Lee said in an interview this week that doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI acquisition will be in the United States.
Lee, whose book "A.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, published this month, has invested in Face++, one of the leading AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an AI system at the University of Milan that beat the highest-ranked American othello player, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted past U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to test the next one.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
Lee said, "It's not China that's turning away academic leaders; it's corporations".
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university intellectuals to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts.
I think that the PhD in AI should be automatically green-carded.
The State Council of China released its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said, "The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to academics, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of Chinese academic work is poor".
Earlier this year, the U.S.: The Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence agency, meant to involve industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence department for a select committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Legislature's bill to create a National Security Commission on the Artificial Intelligence Agency has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to name the country the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, has a province called Macedonia, the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and confirms its entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments had reached an agreement on the basis of a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change will weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gajevor Ivanov has said that he did not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether it will fill at least 50 percent of the votes to be valid for the referendum.
Referendum Question: Do you agree to the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zave, argue that, as Yugoslavia is one of the countries emerging from the collapse, Macedonia must pay to join organizations like the EU and NATO.
Olivra Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje: "I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safe life for all of us".
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make a determination.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament will be required to change the name
State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there has been no report of irregularities.
However, turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, because our place is in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaiev, his wife Zorica and their son Dashko cast their referendum votes in favour of changing the country's name in Macedonia, which will pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old, Vladimir Kavardarkov, was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the tent set up by referendum boycotters.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with our heads up and not through the service door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonians, we can turn to other people like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian unity".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO", Zev said after his vote.
He said, "Yes". The result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll, published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, said that 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required voting.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV's Telma showed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said, yes they will vote
To be successful, the referendum must be over 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum marks the first serious policy shift by a Western government since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero led the whole of Brighton on a security mission.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling secured the title with a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made the score ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence
Before he went on the field, he ran a mix of three Brighton defenders.
Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender before Brigan ran further to the edge of the box.
He then turned to the left to find Sterling.
First, the English used their first touch in the box to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan, causing the shot to go right in the middle of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet.
We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky, he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Stirling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League competition.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the game in the Brington area.
He threw a beautiful ball from the left side of Leroy Sen.
Before leading Sterling to a distant post, San made a few touches.
The Sky Blues had already closed the ball in the net before moving forward.
On Tuesday, the championship group played at 12:55 p.m. at the City Battles Hofheim in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Schönheim, Germany.
Stringer wants to play: Spoiler vs. the Rockies
With the civilians freed from the threat of the playoffs, there was no more reason to force another start.
Scrazer is hoping to take the win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are playoff effects for the Rockies, who lead the NL West in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies won at least a wild card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they're still trying to seal their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can know what the crowd here in Denver is like and the other team will probably play at the highest level at any point and I'll face them this year.
Why do I not want to compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter on Sunday, but they are prepared to report on the pitch of the skater in such a situation.
The Scissors, who are making their 34th start, had a bullpen session today and will pitch at their usual pace on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the president signaled the unfortunate situation that his Supreme Court had elected Brett Kavanaugh.
"What we've done is at stake in November
The most important decision of our lives is five weeks away.
They said, "It's big, big -- I'm not fighting, but I'm really fighting, so I'm going everywhere for the great candidates.
Trump said, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you're seeing it right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the pointlessness, the impurity.
They don't care how much damage they do to those they have to fight for power and control, so they want to take power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
He says, "The Democrats are on a mission to stop and obstruct.
He said, "And in the last four days, you've seen angry and mean and hateful and lying Democrats".
He cited the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, which received a great response from the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, that, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for one - it was actually the worst body language - I've seen the worst body language ever.
There is no universal church of Labour.
It is intolerable for those who speak their minds
When the Momentum workers in my local party scolded me for voting, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the newest in a line of Labour MPs who have written that we are not welcome to speak of mind.
My colleague, Senator John Ryan, behaved in a similar way because she was totally anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized by the censor motion because of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, on issues roughly like this that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, "We want to make the meetings inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, today it is not the sound of many meetings and "kindness, tenderness" has long since forgotten the promise of politics, in fact when it began.
It has become clear that there is no tolerance of dissent in the Labour Party and that every advice is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started immediately after Jeremy became leader, colleagues I had previously thought shared the same political vision, I hope I can take positions in opposition that I would never agree with - whether it be national security or the single market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - after criticizing the abuse on social media, calling for the cancellation of the election, denouncing the politics of the Centre, I am told that I should not remain in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those businesswomen who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but never feel shame.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the level of abuse has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the universal church and every "non-confidence" proposal or change in the election rules weakens the party.
Over the last two years, I've been told a lot to stay calm, not to talk too much, and then to say, "I'll be fine.
But that's not what I came to politics to do.
Because I was involved with Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, infuriated by the Thatcher government's neglect, which had really brought down my vast school class, I had asked for a local councillor or government minister to provide better public services for those who needed them most.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about any disagreement with my policy post and the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that while the country is heading towards Brexit which will hurt families, businesses and our services, I do not wish to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But I don't really have a message for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituency, whether I am a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no disruption or threat of political campaign will ever interfere with my work which I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
AYR 38  17 Melrose: Go to the top of the AYR
Two delayed attempts may have significantly undermined the final results, but there is no doubt that AYR should win this fantastically entertaining tenant's premiership match of the day.
He is now at the top of the list, the only one out of ten.
In the end, it was his better defense, the more likely he was to take a better chance, that led the home team and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be happy.
"We have tested this game so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to A.Y.R, they took better chances than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, replaced by Fraser Climo, put A.Y.R. ahead, however, the yellow card for Scotland's cap Rory Hughes was released by the turn of the play-off, with Melrose allowed to provide the numbers and Jason Baggott making an unseen attempt.
Climo extended the AYR lead with the penalty, first, in the half, he scored and then at the break, he made a single try to make AYR 17-5.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson tried, replaced by Bogut, Levy cut to five points.
Ruddhat Nat was then held up for a long time by a serious injury, which was overcome, and after restarting, A.Y.R. moved forward through the efforts of Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Clymo.
Blair McPherson, acting as A.Y.R. captain, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose paid an extra man to try his place by not replacing Bruce Colvin at the end of the Great Depression.
However, the home team came back and when Strun Hutchison was given a yellow-card for handling Climo to knock him out of the penalty line, McPherson touched A.Y.R. Mole's back.
The climax turned out to be, as if he had started over, Kyle Rowe's return to the flank after collecting David Armstrong's box kick and sending Gregor Henry to the home side for a fifth try.
Still sports stars ready for new career in hotel industry
Still sports star Ford Kieran is set to move into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he has been nominated as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hamfil.

The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish source indicated that Kieran was trying to join Glasgow's "rich food trade".
'The sea is ours': Portless Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Malala patrolled a Regimental Armored Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings wave an ocean blue flag.
Sea destinations from Titicaca to the Amazon were depicted with the motto: "Officially the sea is ours.
It is a duty to get it back".
The memory of a completely harborless Bolivia, from Chile to the beach lost in a bloody 19th-century resource dispute, is still vivid - as the Pacific Ocean once again seeks to swim.
Perhaps those expectations are above all in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a sense of speed, unity and patience, and is looking forward to the outcome with a positive vote", said Roberto Clegidilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
With the large screens and many Bolivians across the country watching the ICJ's decision, it is hoped that the court in The Hague will side with Bolivia's claim as Chile is forced to negotiate for free maritime access to Bolivia after decades of proper negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Christian indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for next year's re-election - is also very much on board with Monday's decision.
She vowed at the end of August, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific".
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor - and if it does, it will change a bit.
The Netherlands has no power to provide the Chilean territory to the UN, and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
Paz Zarate, a Chilean scholar of international law, said that the final arguments heard indicated that the case was "not complex" and that the ICJ's decisions came only six months after it.
And from pushing Bolivia's causes, maybe the last four years have been set back.
"The issue of maritime connectivity has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
He suggested that Morales's rhetoric has deprived him of any distinctive Chilean reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk on some issues for some time, but it will be very difficult to discuss after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltés, former representative of Bolivia in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was too hasty.
Bolivia on Monday will bring a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of Chilean relations and to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Caladilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
He said, Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to get out of the past.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize as long as it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says he will never destroy his nation's nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made to the opposition leaders during an event in Singapore.
His comments are as if US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of resuming a three-month-long standoff with North Korea's Kim Jong Un over Singapore's nuclear diplomacy.
Ri says it is a "pipe dream" that allowed the U.S. to defeat North at any time in response to the continuing and declaring end to the Korean War.
The Washington declaration is consistent and alarming without the initiative of Pyongyang's specific demilitarization moves.
Both Kim and the US, President Donald Trump, want a second event.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to prepare for the second Kim-Trump Summit in Pyongyang next month.
The Paris Fashion Show will showcase a new line in the headline on a large scale along a high street near you.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Sculptors Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of skimpy large-scale headwear for their SS19 collection on the stage runway shining a sleek set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, some very unusual hats have been floating around Instagram and these designers have sent their impressive creations for catwalks.
Valentino was decorated with a fancy top biz hat and a wide wing-like brim that covered the heads of the models.
Other large-scale items include a diamond pearl melon, a unique hat, and a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown reveals a unique mask - just for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One composition with snorkel and enca resembled scuba diving gear, while the other looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you make big fashion statements - you are lucky.
The sightseers guess that the giant hat has made its way to the high alley near you.
Large-scale hats are folded on the bases of 'La Bamba', the pipe cap with a two-foot wide edge that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rajatkoski is seeing.
The cult label behind the very unlikely hat that spread on social media created another great creation for the catwalk - a pipe beach bag as big as a swimsuit - a covered model had to cover it.
The orange wraparound bag in Jacquums' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week was a luxurious outfit, decorated with wraparound sheets and white leather handles on top.
Luke Armitage, who designed the famous artist, told Femle: "I'm looking forward to big hats and beach bags coming on high heels by next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for big things".
John Edward: Language proficiency is essential for global citizens
Scotland's autonomous schools maintain a track record of academic quality, and this continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results that are only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with over 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of Autonomous Independent Schools is to provide their students with further and higher education, to choose their career and to prepare them as citizens of the world.
An educational field that can design and implement the bishop school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages as a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it goes to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his mind.
It is an effective dedication that when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
We can see from the recent test results of this year, that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest pass rate in autonomous schools.
A total of 68 per cent of the trainees had achieved a high grade A by studying foreign languages.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of learners achieved a high grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who achieved A also are studying German, 69 per cent are studying French and 63 per cent are learning Spanish.
This is evidence that foreign languages are being supported in autonomous schools in Scotland as a specific skill that will undoubtedly be essential for children and young people in the coming years.
As a subject choice, languages are now being taught as autonomous school curriculum and elsewhere as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math).
A survey by the Commission for Employment and Skills in the UK in 2014 found that lack of language skills was among the 17 per cent of reasons employers struggle to fill jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming indispensable to prepare more and more young people for their future profession.
In a globalized world, languages are needed for more potential job opportunities, these skills are needed.
Whether one chooses a profession, if they have learned a second language, they will really benefit from this kind of lifelong skill in the future.
A multilingual person will automatically be put ahead in the competition as he is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 per cent of young people were unable to speak a foreign language fluently enough to continue a conversation and French is the only language spoken by a single language of double digits, 15 per cent.
That is why it is more important to spend money on teaching languages to the children of today.
Many languages, especially in developing economies, will be equipped with a better opportunity for children to get meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus more on classical modern languages, while other languages that need to be looked at by 2020 will be the most important languages taught in the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, autonomous schools will always have a range of languages to choose from, including teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Autonomous Schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, that language is very important for the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Autonomous schools will continue to provide choice, diversity and skills for young people in Scotland.

LeBron, to open the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Leacher coach Luca Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against Denver Deog in San Diego.
But it is yet to be determined how many minutes he will play.
The official website Walton on the Lake said it will be more than one and less than 48.
Laker reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will play for limited minutes.
After practice this weekend, James was asked about his "six-game broadcast schedule" plans for the Lakers.
"I don't need the preseason games to get ready for this stage of my career", he said.
Watch the timing of Trump's West Virginia rally on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump's campaign rallies have started to stir up a commotion in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies by Trump over the next week, including stops at convenient locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As well as confirming his petition to fill Supreme Court vacancies, Trump has set a goal of building support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as votes run the risk of losing control of Congress when they are processed in the month of November.
The time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 6pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 25, 2017.
You can watch the live broadcast of Trump's Virginia rally online at the bottom of YouTube.
This week, Trump is set to address the Supreme Court trial of nominee Brett Kwan, who was harassed by sexual misconduct offenses, with a Senate confirmation vote expected for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the rally is to help the Republicans gain some momentum in the November election.
According to Reuters, thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand the majorities held in the Senate and House of Representatives" over the coming week.
A Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters, "Congress control is very much in line with its agenda that the president will travel to the province as much as possible, we are in a busy campaign season.
"Bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the rally tonight and get Pittsburgh media coverage", according to West Virginia Metro News, for arrangements at Wheeling for the Arena.
The territory where he won in 2017 by more than 40 percent will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia on Saturday.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morse, who is running behind in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president has come to try to bounce him in the election", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA on their way to Sunday singles show the fight for the chance to keep the prospects alive
After a three-part session, there will be a group of four people needed for this Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging back and forth of speed is a key to the game concept but one that the player really believes in, and never more.
So they will say where is the speed now?
Jordan Spieth said, "I guess, they had a six-figure lead and now it's four, so we're moving a little bit forward".
Europe has the advantage of leading by more than 12 points in the game.
The Americans, as Speith says, feel that although they have a bounce in their game and they have a lot to be excited about, they are no less form than Speith and Justin Thomas, who each scored three points out of four and played together all day.
Spieth has impressed from the moon to the earth and continues to lead by example.
As his round went on, the screams from his throat became louder, he and Thomas came down twice after two to take all four quarters of the match, and a crucial ball sank.
His (Golf) mary ball that won them the match on 18 balls was hit with the same things, which he believes the American team is not out of.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own match", Spieth said.
Each of these players has now given up all of this.
16 chariots to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, the uncontested legend of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples are four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple not to hit a boogie on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they kept neglecting boogie on Friday afternoon and nine figures went backwards on Friday morning.
The race and the way they both flow energy from this evolved entrepreneurial crowd is that they are the losers on Sunday, and there could be no more popular player than Fleetwood Mac Molinari who could stop the ambitious European from winning as the sun set over Le Golf National.
Especially since they are both on different holes at the same time.
However, the word of European pride remains unchanged.
When she was paired with Alex Nourin, Babbitt Watson and Webb Simpson did a little work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four ball.
A bogey and two doubles drilled a hole in the Spaniard and the Sword on the Samhain dog, who were never close to getting out.
However, on Sunday, there is no one outside your hall to help you.
The four balls and the four acquaintances are very interesting to watch because of the impact of the pair's idea, their advice, their not giving and the way in which a policy can change instantly.
Europe has played well as a team and has taken a reasonable lead on the front and the last day, but this four-man session also showed that the team has the guts to fight, especially Stacyide, was skeptical.
Europe takes a 17-8 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with a 17-6 lead over the USA in Saturday's four-ball and four-man matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari set their own record by taking four points at Le Golf National with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods.
The European side had placed a bet on Thomas Bjorn to retain the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, beating the targeted American team 3-1 in the morning four ball.
The USA faced more opposition in four sets, won two matches, but they did not lose.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points to retain the trophy in Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row in the history of the Ryder Cup as he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational week, were the only other pair to win four of the first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls he beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a heated heats, by another spectacular 4 and 4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two matches on Saturday, had occasionally stunned talent but now he has lost 16 of 20 matches in four-ball and four-know, with seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's four balls, returned with teammate Henrik Stenson in the fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1 to finish first and third in the world.
On a pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris on his way, Europe did not have this.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a spectacular 2-1 on four balls over Spain's John Rahm and Lan Paul and later came back to beat Paul and Rory McLaury 4-3 after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although Furyk's team only needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After the second best two days, however, a Sunday counterattack will be beyond them it seems.
North Korea says 'no way' to unilaterally drop weapons without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions deepened its insecurity in the US and that there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its weapons in such a situation.
Ri Ho Yang told the annual General Assembly of the World's People that last year North Korea had taken "very reasonable and goodwill measures", such as a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, the elimination of nuclear sites, and a commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "While we do not see any complementary response from the US".
There is no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States, and there is no other way in which we can surrender ourselves together without taking up arms in advance.
When Ri pointed out Washington's opposition to North Korea's well-known complaints about denuclearization to honor North Korea, which has taken the necessary steps, its statements seemed significant, as Pyongyang has in the past not denied bilateral denuclearization.
On June 12, Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit where a retired US president and a North Korean leader visited Singapore for the first time, when Kim pledged to work on "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea wanted a written end to the 1953 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on deterrence first and has allowed increased pressure to achieve its objective in a robust manner, he said, and also objected to the declaration of an end to the fighting.
"The understanding that the pandas can beat us is a pipe dream of those who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continuous restrictions are only deepening our mistrust".
Ri made no reference to the second summit talks between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had held at the UN earlier in the week.
Minister Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in discussed three meetings in the last five months and said: "If South Korea had been a party to the issue of denuclearization and not the United States, the denuclearization would not have come to such a standstill on the Korean Peninsula".
When he told the UN, however, the tone of Ri's speech was very dramatically different from last year. The General Assembly was adamant that "Mr. Evil" President Trump would call Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission targeting the US's special soil with North Korean rockets.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally devastate" North Koreans, had lauded Kim for her courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time limit for it, "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued at the UN that the Defense Council should be honored for its action on Pyongyang.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Pompeo told the UN. On Thursday, the Security Council said: "The implementation of the Security Council resolutions must be tough and without fail until we fully understand the final, verifiable nuclear deterrent".
In 2006 the Security Council unanimously lifted sanctions on North Korea in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and gravity-propelled missile programs.
Pompeo met with UN branch Rhian-Path and Ri. General Assembly and later said he would travel to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after his "dumb demands" for North Korea were condemned in just hours.
North Korea had promised to eliminate a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the US takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that he was looking forward to the "conforming step" that Trump had promised in Singapore, a period of security and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
This year a new course at Harvard University has gotten all of its undergraduates a bid to get a good night's sleep by using caffeine-fueled 'all-night wakers' to counter the growing macho culture of study.
The students of the world's number one university are often underestimated when it comes to basic needs like how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sagesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the sleep deprivation effect on education.
'At the end of it a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I being told this now, in my senior year?'
He told the Telegraph, he said he had never been told the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, tells students that good sleep education improves academic and athletic performance as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university made the decision to start the course after students experienced severe sleep deprivation during the week.
A series of interactive tasks is included in the hour-long course.
On one side is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books where the effects of caffeine and light and the effects on the performance of runners and the importance of sleep routines are explained.
In another section, participants are told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, trauma and cancer.
Then, the participants are inspired to think about their daily routine with a map of the campus, with interactive icons.
We know that this will not change the behavior of the student all at once.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke", said Professor Saizler.
Sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, he said, the culture of 'keep everyone awake' is still present.
He said - sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, also ensuring that they want to stop weight gain, as sleep unnecessarily keeps the brain in hunger mode, keeps them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biologist who helped design Professor Czeisler's course, was one of his classmates in his first year at Harvard for the past year.
He said the course has opened his eyes and encouraged him to move on to the campus-wide course.
In the next phase, he hopes, to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competing institution.
Prof. Sjisler suggests that students should set alarms for sleeping and waking, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting which can throw your circadian rhythm out of balance, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Raiders: Menga scored Gerrard's man down
The Rangers had another blow on the far-off day of the competition as Dolly Menga's strike unseated Steven Gerrard for a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side settled for Gerrard's second defeat in just 18 games as Ladbrokes Premiership leaders were stunned by an eight-point drop as manager.
Menga struck seven minutes before half time and never looked even in the Rangers' line-up.
While Rangers have now slipped down from sixth, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And when an object was thrown from a distance, it could be further trouble in store for the Rangers after the injury to the head of lineman Calum Spence.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup that knocked Ayr out.
Holt, on the other hand, went last week with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts and must have been delighted when his drilled drug made it hard to breathe every time his opponents were in his good dress.
The Rangers could have had an effective catch but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score in just two minutes when Menga had initially dropped a goal from Scott Pittman sent through Allan McGregor but the midfielder pushed on his increased opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs got a deep free-kick to then-skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to try on the back post.
Rangers took control but there were more expectations than confidence about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been fine at the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson overrode Colombia's appeal with a hand gesture.
Rangers scored only two first-half goals but were clearly hampered by ex-Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's headed player Lassana Coulibaly and a simple strike by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th-minute opener could have been against the game, no one can deny that he was solely entitled to it for his graft.
Again the Rangers failed to settle with a deep set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slid the ball towards Scott Robinson, who comfortably picked up Menga for a simple elimination.
Gerrard played at centre half as he had taken over from Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch provided almost an instant impact as the winger slotted into Morelos but the effective Kelly ran from his line to the block.
However Livingston was playing exactly the same game he enjoys, sweeping the guests from long to long with Lithgow and Halkett, making a long ball after Lithgow and Hawkett's long ball.
Holt's team could have pulled off the lead in the final round but McGregor stood right to deny Jacobs before hitting head-on from the corner of Lithgow.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton had another penalty late claim because he was confused with Jacobs but then Thomson turned his attention to him.
The invention of the Geiger Counter
And now a page in our "Our Morning" diary: September 30, 1992, today, 13 years ago, and counting... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention later known as the Geiger Counter instrument.
Since a staple of science, the Geiger Counter has also become a staple of pop culture, with the 1960 film "Bells of Coronado", which seems to have starred possibly the famous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Who in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the nuclear radiation given by the radioactive in the minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping up now!"
"Hans" was a few days short of his 73rd birthday, Geiger died in 1940.
But the invention that bears his name.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to detect damaged cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect damaged cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify damaged cells as a cure
The procedure involves extracting the patient's immune cells, converting them into laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that may be common to many cancers and then re-inject it
An investigational vaccine is showing improved results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify damaged cells, was found to have been clear of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the immune cell from the patient, changing the laboratory so that they can see the HER2 protein common in many cancers, and then re-injecting.
Professor J. Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have very good vaccines".
Professor Berzofsky explained that "HER2 drives the development of many cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar effort to extract immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to target cancer cells is underway for a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began denouncing a pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance
It was not right
Kanye West was called into the studio after a stunning performance during Saturday night's live in which he praised the United States of America President Donald Trump and said he would fight for the government in 2020.
After her third song performance at Ghost Town on the night, in which she wore a hat that said America is great, she boasted about reiterating her support for Democrats and Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to a white man and he says: "He's racist, how can you like a trip?"
He said, 'Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago.'
SNL kicked off the show with a sneak peek in which Hollywood star Matt Damon poked fun at Brett Kwan's testimony over sexual assault claims by Christine Blaise Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Footage of West's gig was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock, although it was not aired.
If Rock was trying to joke with West posting it is not clear.
West had also complained to the audience that he had faced a difficult moment behind the stage with regard to the headgear.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
He said, 'You don't have to go out there with a hat on.'
They Harassed Me!
According to the Washington Investigator, he said, and then they said, "I'm in a good place".
West added: "Do you want to see the beautiful place?" saying that he would "put on my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try love".
Her comments caused at least two rounds of cheers from the audience and embarrassed select members of SNL, with one person reporting to Variety, telling the publication: "The whole studio was screwed".
West was brought in to replace the late singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had ended up a few days earlier.
West surprised many people with the performance of the song I Love You by wearing a costume like Periyar Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Tinner who tweeted: "The most courageous spirit: Thank you for standing up to the crowd".
But talk show host Kieran Hunter tweeted that West is just "what she is and it's totally neutral".
Which I believe is embracing and embracing an ideology that is harmful to my society, "but I did not choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or helping their "art")
She is independent.
He said, "We are the same".
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name before the show, saying he was now known as "generally Kanye West".
Changing his name, he is not the first artist and follows in the footsteps of DD, who is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy Daddy and PDD.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and the artist was previously known as Prince.
Charged with premeditated murder with a knife in Belfast restaurant
A 40-year-old man was charged with murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, police said.
The Belfast judges of the defence are expected to appear in court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has a big hit with masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-wielding villain in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Naik, 31, has made an impact on Macho Naik's narrative, saying that on-screen roles like this mean a lot to guys, often feeling they need to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something has gone wrong' and how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 13, admitted that she feels 'very tight' about addressing the issue.
He said, 'At this point, I personally feel to a great extent, - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?'
'In terms of the problems now, what are we teaching men as they grow up?'
Kit believes that television can be attributed to some extent to the rise of masculinity in general, thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is maternal and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, that makes young boys feel like a man, that they have some side to them?
How can we change this, I think, is really one of the big questions of our time.
Because something has clearly gone wrong with some of the youngsters.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones at the end of next summer because 'he's had enough of the battlefields and the horses.'
Kit will star in Sam Shepard's revival of True West from November which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a bandit.
Recently, Naik has revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best way to get out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, and this is how it gave me my future family and my life grew.'
Rose Ygritte, played the love interest of Jon Snow, the character from Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In Scotland, the couple married in June 2017 in Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China has recorded 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 250, 000 people are affected in the country.
About 49,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2017 alone.
There is a shift from the past where a large number of cases were transmitted through sexual contact.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood being donated.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan, but the number of people living with HIV had thus been reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 170,000 people year on year.
A serious issue in China's LGBT community is the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in the 1970s, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
With the transmission of many diseases, insecure sexual security comes from these relationships.
Since 2013, the Chinese government has pledged to make efforts to address the issue as part of widespread access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that staff members had leaked data, blasted 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories' from GOP senators.
Rep. Maxine Waters of the United States on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrats insisted that the claims were being driven by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies and other reprehensible lies".
Information released by home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Sinus. Both Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
Information posted by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was seen online on Thursday.
The secret of this information was discovered shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanhoff.
According to information from Capitol Hill, Gateway experts and conservative sites like Red State reported that the IP addresses that identify the source of the posts were linked to Waters' office and a member of Waters' staff has also been informed.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters added.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and security compromises have resulted in these fraudulent and false allegations - were in no way responsible for disclosing the confidentiality of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a lie.
Waters' statement prompted criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fletcher wrote, "This is an angry denial".
"This shows that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
They should not feel guilty.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They should be calm and united".
Fletcher appeared to compare Judge Kavanhoff's criticism by Democrats to Waters's reaction, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Nawar also expressed his opinion on Twitter for removing Waters from the midterm elections.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he added, "and they will be held legally accountable for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any of my employees and all employees".
Johnny English reviewed twice - Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof was underestimated.
It has become conventional to see the Brexit significance in any new film with a British film and this applies to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned with the well-known English Reborn in 2011.
Will we be blabbering about a topic in a misguided self-deprecating manner, clearly stating that we are the country's new export opportunities?
At any cost, Pop-Aid, Beirut Akshay Johnny English has a license to start over for the second time - their name indicates they are a comprehensive comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemas.
He is definitely a draft secret agent who despite his disguise for mild glamour got a little clausoleum, a dash of Mr Bean and a face contributing to a note for the chariots of Fire Throwned at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is based primarily on the mystery of the traveler and international figure, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclayscard TV commercials, leaving him in a mess.
There are also one or two good moments in this latest GE Outing.
I liked Johnny English coming towards a helicopter, wearing a mid-armored suit and rotary blades rotating against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on display, but laughter is rarely and oddly over-the-top, especially as "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently present themselves as a component.
The humor feels like it's pitched to children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's silly exercises are not uncertain and the personality of Bean is centered on Atkinson's spooky-movie gags.
The long-standing situation is that Great Britain is in a serious crisis.
A cyber-hacker has penetrated Britain's spy super-secret web network, revealing the identities of all the UK agents in the region, leaving the agent on duty - a pathetic minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final nail in the coffin for a Prime Minister, a man of pomp and circumstance, already completely broken by political populism: Emma Thompson performs at her best with this Quasi-Teresa-Me character but there is little to work with the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that as every active spy had compromised, he would have to bring someone out with a pledge.
And that means fighting Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh prestige, but is giving off-the-record lessons to become an undercover operative: There are some good gigs, like the English School of Rock-type spy academy.
English was sent back to the White House for an emergency briefing and was reunited with his long-suffering predecessor, Siddique Bowe, played by Ben Miller.
Now Bo is a married man, dressed for a submarine commander, a fake-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Paperdine has been somewhat wasted.
As Batman and Robin face a badly misunderstood mission to Her Majesty's Secret Service, Olga Kureylenko meets the beautiful and attractive woman Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the mantrums of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer crisis: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo started their hilarious high-zinc odyssey: disguised as a waiter, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they smuggle on board Volta's yacht; and English operates the pure situation as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home using a virtual reality headset.
All stops are definitely taken out in that final sequence, but as it is capable and adaptable, there is plenty to tell about the whole thing in the children's TV.
Beautifully modified goods.
And with other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really did justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is planning a four-day workweek for people in Britain but is paying for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would make the British people see a four-day week working - but being paid for five.
The party wants the bosses of the company to pass on savings to the workers by giving them extra days off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This will give employees the benefit of a three-day week - but they will still take home the same salary.
Sources said that the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and would favour the country in favour of the workers.
The four-day week is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economic situation as confirmed by the Trades Union Congress.
A senior Labour Party leader told the Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight but the four-day work week is an inspiration that fits with the whole industrial strategy of the party as well as the vision of the party to rebalance the economy in the employee's favour.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to confirm such an idea, the Green Party held a four-day work week during its 2017 party general election campaign.
The will is not fully confirmed by the Labour Party at present, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDaniel used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDaniel said that he was determined to get the utility back from France from the "uncharacteristic directors" and "profiteers".
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also meant that the current shareholders in the sunk companies could not get their full stake back as the Labour government could have 'cut' them based on willful misconduct.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to put employees on company boards and to transfer 10 per cent of private sector firms' amount (equity) to employees, which can take up to £500 in annual benefits.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy in 60 Minutes, explains whether the FBI's Kwanzaa investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kwanhoe has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the question arises whether the bureau's findings should be supported by any Republican senators.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelle asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI would find anything that would motivate them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more explicit than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, certainly", Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kwanho.
I called him after it happened, the accusation came out, said, 'Did you do that?'
He was steadfast, firm, without doubt".
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kwanhoe and it will be a dynamite accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one could confirm it by the name of the man who had been called.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This weekend, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a spectacularly impressive star lineup and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but to bring awareness to the real goal of the program of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or tasks, such as emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or adopting some other meaningful means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a real way to get people to act, or is it just a matter of cliqueism - people seemingly making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters with an emphasis on hosting for different purposes.
It says that this work has helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than $2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the start of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its work, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have had a direct impact on approximately 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers "committed to helping children grow to their full potential", pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens, we can reduce the social injustice of a foot-note in history like you, Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ulla told the crowd during a live music event in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a new scheme, Strength of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and girls by giving nutrition interventions.
How do you feel about the question "Can we end extreme poverty?"
The World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the exhibitors at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furniss and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy blockade to "impede" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington investigator, Washington could resort to its waters to prevent Russian forces from entering the market, including the Middle East, "if necessary", US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinké accused Russia's action in Syria - in particular, where it is being carried out at the invitation of the legitimate government - of being an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason he is in the Middle East is because the energy broker wants to do the same as they do in Eastern Europe, towards the southern side of Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinc was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the voice of energy consumers in America.
He will compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic alternative on Iran and Russia is to more or less replace and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia's single-purpose patch with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come that the Trump administration is on a mission to boost its LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, became Berlin's "bond" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy pressure cannot be exercised by a single material and consumers must be able to choose a supplier", Russian Energy Minister Hangzo Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading organisation for German industry, has announced the US withdrawal from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when the third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieterich Kempeff, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting at German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will keep a close eye on the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will keep a close eye on the presidential election in view of the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed during a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts that she would consider the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman above all", according to Hill, she said.
"After November 6, I will keep a close eye on the presidential election".
Warren told President Donald Trump during a town hall that he was "taking the county in the wrong direction" by saying it.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", he said.
Warren spoke out in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
In a poll released on Thursday, a majority of voters in Warren's own constituency indicate they don't think she will run in 2020.
Eighty percent of Massachusetts "potential" voters say the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two (32) per cent of the people responded in this way.
The survey showed more support for such a system by former Governor Dev Patik, with 38 percent supporting this viable system and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that were discussed regarding the 2020 prospects include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin made a statement at the rally of Donald Trump, PTSD of Track Palin.
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted on Sept.
On Monday night, she was arrested in a domestic violence incident and fined.
"What my own son is doing, what he's going to do when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the impact of PTSD and some of the choices that our troops bring back with them", he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin described his arrest as "a bad situation" and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come with determination, they think if this is how they are respected that this is how their other soldiers and airmen (airmen) and every member of the military have given to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with assaulting a woman in domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and possessing a drug-related weapon, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states challenge D.C.'s support for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to survivors of group or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts knocked on the door of the Friend of Court in Washington on Friday to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the person suing in court is also Grace. The Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not appeared.
She said her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her but US authorities rejected her request for asylum until July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The attorney general of the states, Grace, supported the case of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generates a large number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as the international states face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend of the Court summarized, "It is essential to federal law that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the specific facts of the claim, and the circumstances and such a bar violates this principle".
The attorneys briefly argued that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy by saying they are more likely to "work hard enough" and become entrepreneurs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to allow shelter for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence who survived in June.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu double the number of deaths in the race to find the living.
The conditions for the living were terrible.
"It feels very stressful", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-stricken child at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, which is plagued by floods.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is very scarce".
Residents were seen coming into their destroyed homes, picking up water-damaged belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were seriously injured and taken to hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 quake, they were submerged under water.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were held outside the Army Hospital in Palu where patients were being treated outside after a series of shocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room, as he told his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to defend myself.
I was laid out in the rubble of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to me and her baby.
Hopefully they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of bullying and propaganda.
An official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the US a week later, accusing the US ambassador to China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register last Wednesday - Lowa's biggest selling newspaper - accusing it of trying to interfere with China in the U.S. on November 6.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a major campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
However, it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade. Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war, which has seen them raise the level of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, China had prepared to scuttle exporters in retaliatory tariff states such as Lowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Bernstad and longtime governor of Lowa, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brunswick wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Maines Register, is "now doubling down on bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using itself as a free press in the tradition of free speech in the United States and by giving paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Brunsted wrote.
In contrast, here on the Newsstand downtown in Beijing, you will find limited dissent and no true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people can think about China's troubled economic trend, stating that the Chinese media is completely under Communist Party control", he wrote.
He said that "one of the most popular newspapers in China cleverly turned down the offer to publish", in his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans with Kwanhoe already isolated female voters, analysts warn.
Many top Republicans have supported and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanhoe in the wake of multiple allegations of physical assault, with analysts warning they would see a backlash during the midterm election, especially coming from women.
The sentiment around this has been very high, and most Republicans are already showing they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things cannot be turned back", Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in a letter on Saturday.
Rehr said he doubted that a last-minute action to investigate Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women are not forgetting what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOne, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters said "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallway that the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kwanhoe's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christie Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to shut the charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying that it is already high, that is correct.
But it can be high, especially among swing women (who can vote for any candidate) voters in the suburbs and young voters, those aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president, don't often vote".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that a stumbling block might occur if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a complicated mess for GOP", said Michael Staley, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kwanhoe sits on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities America, a group that helps Democrats win, pointed to the news channel.
Yet Americans are somewhat divided into those who believe after the testimony of Ford and Kwanhoe, and those who do not.
A new survey from Yugow shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or perhaps believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
Further, 38 per cent said they think Kavanaugh is probably or probably lying during his testimony, while 30 per cent have said exactly the same about Ford.
Following Flake's gesture, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations on Ford's behalf and by at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, of The Guardian, told The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kwanhoe had assaulted her at the age of 17 by drinking a syrup.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court representative exposed his genitals to him when he attended a party while attending Yale in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web are making plans to take a new Internet to Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a startup that has been seen as resisting Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt is a company that solidifies Burns-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "rule the world".
We have to do it now, he has told us to start it.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to store their "personal online data" or create a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
These are all available on the same browser and at the same time like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data online is that it is entirely dependent on the user who can access the information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources to the company, process and appropriate skills to help make solid available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce's, a security platform that was purchased by IBM, some staff contracted to work on the developer's project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team are not talking to "Facebook and Google" about whether or not they might be in a position to offer a complete change, where all their business models have grown completely overnight.
"We are not asking for their help".
In a post on the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is "to provide commercial energy and a natural system to protect integrity and a quality to build the web on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches InRupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next wave of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated 100 years later in his hometown as a fighting warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack on Bellinglis and Lehocurt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his grandchildren in a parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughan, said it was a "magnificent sign", the stone would appear almost 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal in "a very dense fog and heavy shelling from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and with "great bravery" led the line forward before firing a field-gun with one hand and defeating (winning) three different pieces.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never accomplish but something that is diminishing in importance.
He and his brother Dr James Vaughan held a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "feeling very honoured to take part in the parade" and said "the bravery of a true hero is shown by the support that is being shown by so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Baller 206, instead they got to watch Papa Pig (a British cartoon serial).
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch a ballot 206 pack and you were denied the main agenda.
The bill from San Jose had 13 disputes, six of which were on the main card and were being shown in the UK by Channel 5 at night.
At 6am, as Gajard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were surprised when the coverage was turned into Papa Pig.
Some were very unimpressed after staying awake for the fight, especially in the early hours.
A supporter on Twitter described the transformation of the children's cartoon as "some kind of low-level joke".
"It's the government policy that by 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to kids' programs", said Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Dave Squartz, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, Papa Pig" is the name of the song.
Scott Cocker, President of Ballet Company, said that he is going to work on his timetable to include the UK audience in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we might be able to work on it", Coker said.
"But we will not be able to finish the work on Sunday at six in the morning and by our own time, Monday according to their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it changed, many of the writings were outdated and not all of them were like friendships.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not so, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that next time it will not be like this.
We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we tried to give the fans the maximum and we just previewed it.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island (disc): Tom Dahl feels 'underrated' about sex
Olympic diver Tom Dalle says he grew up feeling repulsed by everyone because of his sexuality.
The 24-year-old says he didn't experience "everyone is not like me" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lorraine Labyrinth, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a father makes him even more ineligible to win the Olympics.
The long-running regular presenter of the show, Christie Young, has been on hiatus for several months due to illness.
A preview of Castaway (an American drama film) was shown on Labrinth's first program, with Daly saying that she felt "less than anyone" who is getting older because "it's not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, feeling their feelings undermined, and feeling isolated are the real emotions that have given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so when he suddenly found out about his sexuality he didn't disappoint everyone.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT evangelist and her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to other countries to decriminalize gay people.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to live openly without any opposition and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "shocked me".
Dalle married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but he said the age difference was not an issue.
"When you go through it at such a young age" - he first went to the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone at the same age who had the same experience of good and bad as you.
The couple became parents of a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said his "entire outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all because of him 'I had to win the gold medal,'" she said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Roberts, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 during a brain cancer diagnosis.
He said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if he had tickets to London 2012 - so he could sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him (his father) 'Dad you're not even going to sit around the first row,'" he said.
"I held his (my father's) hand and he stopped breathing. And it wasn't until he stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally found out that he wasn't alive", she said.
The following year, Dalle participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew how I dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of crowds at the Olympic Games was the best experience", he said.
He inspired the choice of his first song - Pride by Heather Small - which he hated in the production of the Olympics and has so far made his rings stand.
He will be appearing on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 (BST time) on Sunday for the Desert Island Disc.
Michaelson, who was performing poorly, was ruled out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match but he will have to come into full form to avoid this unfortunate milestone.
Michaelson was ruled out of playing in the biennial competition for a record 12th time by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday morning and afternoon (balls to be played in the Ryder Cup).
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often does for the U.S., the five-time major winner divided his day between being a cheerleader and improving the scope of the game while working on his range of play that he felt was bad.
Never playing the most straight at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old tight end is not an ideal fit for a golf national course, where the long-rumped swinging shooter regularly hits shots.
And if the courses themselves aren't tough enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Michaelson faces the rightful British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans are four points short of the start of 12 singles matches, don't play fast, Michaelson's match may prove to be completely uncapped.
Furik expressed confidence in his servant, and he could not say much more.
"What he did today was he fully understood his role, he gave me a slap and put his hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furik said.
"He gained a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and has added a lot to these teams this week, and this week.
I probably thought he was playing two matches.
I thought more, but this is the way it worked and so we thought this is the way we have to go.
He wants to go there like everyone else".
Michaelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could signal the end of a Ryder Cup career that doesn't quite match the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brings some strength and confidence to the team.
"He's weird, he's crazy, he's funny, he likes to be tough on people. And he's a good guy to be in the team room", he said.
"I think the younger players should have gone for it in terms of the fun, as well as this week, getting to see the fun.
He gives more than playing".
Europe's captain Thomas Bajorne warns that Big Lead (an American blog newspaper) may soon disappear.
The European captain, Thomas Bajorne, knows from experience that the measured lead in the Ryder Cup could easily turn into an unsafe ride in the final day's singles.
Dane played his first match at the 1997 Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans but finished the winning finish line just below their nose with very few penalties, winning by only 14 1/2 to 13 1/2.
"You keep reminding yourselves that we had a very big lead at Valderrama; our very big lead at Bracklin where we lost and Valderrama where we won, but only Bjorn said on Friday and yesterday looking at the 5-3 winning teams of 2018 took a 10-6 lead over the team at Lee Golf National.
So history will tell me and everyone is in his team that is not finished.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do good deeds.
It is not over until you get the marks on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I have said everything together, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side - the greatest players in the world.
Very happy with how his players performed on a tough golf course, Bajoran said: "I would never have progressed in this before.
The future is a dangerous beast.
The coming days are individual demonstrations that come up, and it's a different thing to do.
It is good to go there with your partner, when things are going well, when you are there in person, then you are tested to fulfill your potential as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, they will get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, the number-versus-number Jim Furyk sees his players individually performing better than their peers, with the exception of Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in all four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big end-times, being part of the winning team at Brooklyn before becoming a loser as Europe performed the "miracle at Medina".
"I remember every bad word of it", he said when asked how the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, prevented his players from joining the final day's race.
"Tomorrow we have 12 matches but you should start with the same speed as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We got fully prepared in our line and put the guys in fashion that we liked, you know tomorrow we are doing something miraculous".
Thomas has been tasked with leading the most intense match and facing Rory Michaelroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tony Fleetwood and Ian Poulter among other Europeans in the first half.
"I went with the guys in this group in this order because I think it would be completely covered", Bajoron said in his Singles Selections.
Germany's new warship was postponed again
The German Navy had allowed the commissioning of the newest frigate of the German Navy in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship. But this could not happen the following year due to poor system and low cost, local media reported.
The approval of the lead ship "Reinland-Pfalz" of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the military spokesman.
Wessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but a troubling post-delivery issue put the future of the ambitious project at risk.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will replace the obsolete Berman-class vessels, which were withdrawn by the Navy in 2007.
It is understood to be a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as suitable for some stealth techniques such as radar reduction, infrared and high-speed signals.
Other important features are that it will not have to be repaired for a long time. It should be possible to implement it when new frigates are separated from their ports for about two years.
However, the constant delays mean that warplanes are being put at risk by asking Germany to allow a power project abroad - already that will be obsolete by the time the service starts, DyJet wrote in the note.
The ill-fated F-120 warplane made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to pay for the plane and returned it to Lom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little information was available on the reasons for the return, but according to German media, the warship was not fit for any combat due to "software and hardware failures".
The software flaws were more significant because the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of some 1,200, half the number of those operating the older Bremen class battleship.
It was also found that the weight of the aircraft was too heavy, which reduced its capability and prevented the Navy from adding new items in the future.
The Rhineland-Fallas is considered to be a double-hulled vessel with a displacement of 6 tons compared to similar class vessels.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training the crew, was also becoming an issue.
It is said that the expenditure - from the initial €2.2 billion - had reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) in the past.
Recent warnings of the declining strength of the German Navy, highlighting the inconvenience of not being able to catch new warships
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the army actually had "a lack of deployable aircraft".
The issue has become bigger and more important over time, as old aircraft were removed as unfit but no other aircraft were brought in their place, the official said.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Württemberg class warship could be commissioned into the Navy.
The National Trust secretly monitors the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands reveals how bats use the landscape to find food
It is hoped that this discovery will shed light on the behaviour of this unique flying animal and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will include the common, separanopoepistral, brown long-eared and dobunton bats found in the Inverwood Gardens in West Rode
Recorders will be installed at certain locations to monitor bat activity throughout the season
NHS staff and helpers will also conduct small-scale surveys with handheld detectors.
Special analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the butterfly's sound and also determine what type of bird is doing what.
A practical map and a report will be presented, based on which a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour will be drawn up.
NTS conservation consultant, Rob Dever, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help in habitat management activities such as grassland creation and improving forest conservation for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined dramatically over the last century
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their habitat and mines.
Windmills and electricity, chemical treatment of fly paper and building materials, and attacks by pet cats can also pose a threat to the environment.
Bats are not actually blind
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes for catching prey.
They use a modern echo-location technique to detect insects and obstacles in their airway
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very critical to the bat population.
It has well trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, investigations and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, and is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the place is an ideal place for them to live.
"Here at Thriveview we have a great place for bats", she said.
We have old buildings, old trees and good places to live.
But there is still much to be learned about bats, so work here and elsewhere will help us to understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of screening the bats before cleaning up these properties, etc. because any miscarriage could kill 40 women and young men, possibly the entire local population.
It is illegal to keep bats, kill them, harass them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish Officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, encourages people to help
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape claims and lawyers ready to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo presents rape claims against him as "fake news" and says people use his name to "promote themselves"
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Meorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009
According to Der Spiegel, he is accused of paying the woman $30 to keep quiet about the incident.
Hours after the report's claims, in an Instagram live video, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news", telling his 142 million followers:
No, no, no, no, no, not at all
What he said today, fake news, "five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera
They just want to broadcast themselves using my name
This is normal
They want to be famous by my name, it's part of the job.
The player smiled, adding, "I am a happy man and all is well".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call "suspicious, unacceptable reporting in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will be compensated for "moral damage, which is probably the most serious violation of privacy rights in recent years, commensurate with the seriousness of the violation".
It is said that the incident occurred in June 2006 in a suite overlooking the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Meorga returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where the player raped Meorga.
Meiruga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and said that he was "60 percent" a "good guy" but lost to "one percent".
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had intercourse, but that the intercourse was consensual.
Meyorga claims that she went to the police and even had pictures of her injuries taken in the hospital, but she later agreed to settle out of court because she feared "revenge" and "social humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now trying to dismiss the deal because she is mentally very upset by the incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer joined Italian giants Juventus in a $1.8 million deal.
Brexit: UK will always regret 'losing the car makers'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if the UK lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, "the UK will regret it forever".
He added that it is noteworthy that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its factory in Barnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
Japanese carmaker says border delays due to no-deal Brexit could hurt jobs
The Barnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced around 16,000 vehicles last year, of which 67% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Managing Director, Toyota, Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover also expressed concern over no deal on border trade with the EU.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its small plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
In a no-deal Brexit, the main concern for vehicle manufacturers are supply chain risks
Toyota's production line runs on a "Just in Time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes to build vehicles ordered from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 25 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, leading to delayed delivery and shortages of material, according to the industry.
Toyota said it may be impossible to keep cargo for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Draft Plan for the future of relations with the EU is well aligned to prevent border checks.
"We need to make a deal because we want the best deal that will not only give us the joy of success but also the opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have come to the conclusion that we need to keep the supply chain running as it has been very successful.
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but looking at the long term, it warned that rising costs would reduce the plant's earnings and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Sowaleris, who worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is the plant's unit union convener, said that his members are also becoming concerned that "in my experience if these jobs are gone once, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We must present a definite and credible plan for our future with the EU".
The White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed indefinitely
The White House said Sunday that the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanoh could delay a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein by "another week".
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates links between Russia's election interference and Trump's associates and possible obstruction of justice by Russia and the president.
It was a topic of discussion in Washington for months whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein used a wire to record a conversation with Trump and discuss the possibility of removing the president through the 20th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report
But last Monday he went to the White House and during these reports he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and meeting were delayed to avoid conflict, with the committee hearing hearing witnessing Kwannoah and a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh and again delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set for this meeting yet, maybe this week, I can see that due to the rest of the things going on in the Supreme Court this meeting can be pushed back for another week".
But we'll look into it and I always like to give the press the latest news.
Some journalists go against this claim: Sanders has not held a single White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wells asked why
Sanders said the reason behind the fewer press conferences was not dislike of the TV reporter, "just that", though she said: "I can't deny the fact that they are very up on the game".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be enhanced.
He said that "the President has more Q&A sessions than any other President", without providing any evidence, he added: "We have seen this number in the past.
"But if the press gets a chance to ask the president directly, it's much better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We try very hard to do this, and you've seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and there will be a press conference where you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries
There are very few press conferences together
This week in New York, the president may have shown why he should address the press in an independent and sometimes bizarre manner.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
Health Secretary writes to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the country and expresses their wish to stay after Brexit
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter when it took the UK less than six months to leave the EU
The Scottish Government had already accepted to bear the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations on retreat in the UK and EU continued, with the prospect of decisions moving towards the autumn.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
So I want to say again that I fully appreciate the ability of every staff member regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennesseean Mike Og reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-26 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just kind of piled up", Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/depth of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt, sophomore high school kid, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of 18 tackles before being out of the game on Saturday, bringing his total tackles for the season to 17.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK and this increased amount will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
This move will undermine the success of Corbyn's ploy to attract young voters.
Stamp duty increases will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it can raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK and that the increased amount will be used to help homeless people.
The move will undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's strategy of attracting young voters and provide affordable housing to the poor while targeting the rich.
Stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK and with the extra money the government will tackle the problem of people sleeping rough without a home
Surcharge - which has to be paid apart from the current stamp duty which was increased on other houses and renters by buying two years ago, may be increased further to three per cent
The Treasury hopes that this could raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's newly built buildings are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it even more difficult for first-time home buyers to get a foot on the ladder.
Many affluent parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as many foreign customers spend their time outside the country
To allow young people to buy their first home easily, Boris Johnson reduced the stamp duty for young people and only a few weeks later this new policy was introduced.
He accused large construction firms of keeping land prices high for not buying land and urged Mr. Mati May to remove the quota on affordable housing to stop the "dishonor of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn introduces eye-catching reforms that end rent control and "no-fault" eviction
He also wants to give the councils increased powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to reviving the British dream - to make life better for every new generation.
And that means we're fixing our market for collapsed homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and spend their lives here
However, it is not true that individuals or foreign companies who do not live in the UK would buy a home here as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many, the dream of buying a home has become a reality, and sleeping without a home has become a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says that his "ultimate dream" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, is working on the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, which is now third in the league, three points behind the first.
After leading St Mirren to the Scottish premiership last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player
I got a B cap and that was the end", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sporting Voices.
"But I grew up with my dad, in Hampden, exploring Scotland, and it was something that always held me back.
But, this opportunity can only come if I succeed in managing the club.
Ross's ancestors as the manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo's Canyons.
Former Aloha Athletic boss said that after first getting banned from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, he felt no nervousness from such established names at such a big club.
"At the moment, my success will be measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'"
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it should be in the Premier League without a doubt", he said.
It is not an easy task to bring the club back, but I will probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring this club back".
After 15 months of training as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and coaching staff at Hearts, Ross has only three years in a management career.
He then saved Aloha from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren to win the championship that season.
And Ross said he feels much more comfortable now than he did in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
He mentioned taking responsibility for Aloha, saying "it is possible that it was a real crossroads".
I really believed that more than playing, management was right for me.
It may seem strange because I did, it led to a decent life and even enjoyed some high happiness in the past.
But playing can be difficult, too.
On a weekly basis you have to do a lot of things.
I still go through the stress and pressure of the job, but still the management seems to be fine.
I've always wanted to manage, and now that I'm doing it, I feel most comfortable in my entire adult life, as if I'm in my own skin.

Summer heat has boosted efficiency for Britain's struggling pubs but put increased pressure on restaurant chains
Sales of pubs and liquor contract groups rose 2.7 percent in July - but fell to 4.8 percent in restaurants
Peter Martin, Business Advisor, CAGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Due to the continued sunshine and England's longer than expected World Cup participation, July was the same as last month in June, with a 2.8 per cent increase in contracts but the restaurant situation was made more difficult.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars served alcohol were far more popular than restaurants, and the restaurant was just as bad.
Food pubs are also exposed to sunlight but not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for drinks.
For this month, alcohol sales in managed pubs and contractors increased by 0.6 percent but food fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RMS, Leisure and Leisure, said: "These results have been seen since the end of April and are still ongoing.
Weather and major social or sporting events have a greater impact on out-of-home sales of the marketplace.
It is not surprising that the struggle for the restaurant group will continue to grow as sales continue to decline by 4.8 percent year-on-year and additional expenses are making the situation even more painful.
This long summer has brought a bad time for food-based operators and time will tell whether they get much needed relief in the moderate temperatures we saw in August".
Total sales in July this year, including newly opened pubs and restaurants, rose by 2.7%, showing a slowdown for Brenda.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor brings together the performance of the UK's 47 pub, bar and restaurant sector operating groups, with a total turnover of £8 billion, and analyses them to establish an industry chain.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One survey shows that, by the age of 11, one in five children has a secret social media account that they keep secret from their parents and teachers
A survey of 2,800 secondary school children showed an increase in "fake Instagram" pages
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
For children as young as 11, one in five has a secret social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 2,700 secondary school children shows an increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted in the media.
20 percent of students say they use a clean "main" account to show parents, and they even have a personal account
A mother who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager on the site saying to others, "Rape me"
Research conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half having personal accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is very disturbing that so many young people are creating online places for themselves where parents and teachers can't find them".
Ale Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board
Ale Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most recognised track and field athletes and Chairman Ian Beatty called it a great move, saying it is a great opportunity for those who can benefit from Doyle's vast international experience.
"Ehle is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community and we are confident that his involvement will greatly benefit athletics in Scotland", said BT.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be able to act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to lead the sport in Scotland and help take it forward.
The US athlete, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 20m and 40m at the 1960 Games in Atlanta, was unable to walk due to a temporary ischemic attack and is now a BCC specialist.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke today a month ago.
I can't walk
The doctors said whether I would recover or not and if so how well I would recover, only time can tell.
It was a terrible job, but now I am completely healthy, I learned to walk from scratch, and today I am drilling!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mother's milk to cow's, distributes online opinion poll
A breast pump company has shared ideas online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers and cow's milk to milk.
To mark the launch of the "world's first silent pump worn on the chest", consumer tech company LV released an advertisement by making a talk-in-language music video, offering freedom for mothers to use it.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a cow-plowing furnace, with the lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you will not see a tail" and "If you didn't notice that these are not breasts but my candies"
The song continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my women"
However, the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it sheds a "terrible" light on the dairy industry.
"The decision to use cows in advertisements for this product is very wrong.
One wrote, "They have to be pregnant to give birth, just like us, but their babies are stolen days after birth".
LV breast pump fits properly within the nursing bra (LV/m)
Another commented: "It is stressful for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to raise their children?
Another added: "It's beyond the reach of advertisements".
Others defended the advertisement, one woman admitting that she found the song "reassuring"
I think it's a brilliant idea, but it's not.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would definitely take one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
One wrote, "It is a talented product.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like "cows".
This advertisement is not praising or denigrating the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with pumps attached to their bras.
The campaign is based on the idea that many women who use pumps feel like cows in the kitchen.
The LV pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes on it and comes comfortably inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and go anywhere while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Mothers and colleagues and ECD commented: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product worthy of such a bold and gritty start.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to express it in a fun and complete way, taking into account all the challenges associated with breast pumps, which also showed the wonderful sense of freedom given by the pumps.

Hundreds of migrant children move peacefully to a tent camp on the Texas border
While the monthly number of children crossing the border has been temporarily maintained, the tough policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to give children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have come in undocumented, and they fear that claiming any child would jeopardize their ability to live in their country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that prospective sponsors and other members of their family would have to present fingerprints and that this information would also be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors.
The agency later confirmed that 67% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Six percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of the sponsors household are living here illegally, and many of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue those individuals", Mr. Alban said.
According to the refugee workers, to expedite the process for children, the authorities introduced new rules whereby they have to appear in court within 1 month of detention, not 10 days.
Many people will present their case to an immigration judge for legal status via video conference call rather than in person.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be immediately deported.
According to reports from refugee workers and in the months following their departure from the system, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape by hiding.
Lawyers say such concerns could arise in a large place like Tornillo, where signs of child struggles are more likely to be overlooked due to its large size.
He further said that sending children to a tent city without giving them enough time to get emotionally ready or to say goodbye to friends can shock them into what they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulm also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Maulm, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, were illegally on Syrian soil, and "will be dealt with accordingly"
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Maulm stressed that in Syria, where more than 30 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, "the war against terrorism is almost over".
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy war until we clear both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence from the Syrian territories".
There are some 2,300 US troops in Syria, primarily training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 150 soldiers from France and the war-torn country are involved in the operation.
On the issue of refugees, Maulm said that conditions were good for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unusual fears" and encouraging refugees to stay away.
He said that "we have called upon the international community and humanitarian agencies to facilitate these returns".
They are making a political issue that should be totally humanitarian.
The US and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has opened the door to moving forward with political talks by establishing a free zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold.
This Russian-Turkish deal helped prevent a large-scale attack by the Russian military on the province where 3 million people live, with assistance from Syria.
Maulm stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeframe" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of government and opposition members will soon be convened to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Maulm laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's task would only be to "review the articles of the existing constitution" and warned against any further interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2026, unless, as many independent viewers may be hoping, his criticism and some controversy will end his presidency prematurely.
That would be without a doubt "the most dramatic end of a president"!
At present, there is no sign of fatigue in the audience
Since 2014, prime time numbers on CNN have doubled to over 1.5 million and on MSNBC nearly tripled to over 1.5 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average prime-time audience of 24 million, up from 18 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Meadow Show" has the highest cable ratings on news nights with 30 million viewers.
The host of the ABC drama, "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol collapses, Neil Baer, said, "It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand".
Neil Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funniest: And Hollywood Boys" has another theory of the hard truth about infiltration in the "club".
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump
Why? he asked
Miss Scovell told me that she said, "He makes me laugh".
Recreation is important in this mess
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited and what will happen to the global economy.
A pleasure is being prepared which will be enjoyed only by the most qualified audience
And yet, when you watch a panel of experts wrestle for six hours over the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", Paul Manfort's $180, a garter-leather bomber jacket (a thick cloth, the Washington Post said), and Stormy Daniel's physiological analysis of Mr. Trump, you find yourself getting more than an informed citizen impression.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheel House Entertainment and creator of "Pon Stars", said of the changing cast of Trump's play and the changing characters of the day-to-day actors (choice a fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un) that "everything he's doing feels like a real play so he's giving you something to eat every night".
You can't leave out a single context or you'll be left behind in the future.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, it was a 90 degrees outside his house on the northern edge of Kauai, but he was busy watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
When Brett Kavanaugh was present to face the Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, he couldn't help but feel his way through.
Mr. Fleiss told me, "I remember when we were doing crazy dramas all day, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true.

External money floods the very difficult middle class election race
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania is seeing a flood of money in the 17th, once again for two candidates running for the same seat in two congressional districts.
The recently reconstituted suburban Pittsburgh district has targeted Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring - for his alleged role in the death of a former mayor.
Lamb is running against incumbent Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the current Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily interspersed with the new 17th district.
Maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally assigned in favor of Republicans.
The new 18th race kicked off a campaign finance competition between the main party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
After a very close victory in the highly-watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, that seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 25 points.
Political experts favored the Democrats slightly
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China but then backed down.
The ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama, with a little help from Washington, have already recognized Beijing as a foreign power.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team was expelled by his partners.
Earlier this month, Heather North said in a statement that State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "new decision to recognize Taiwan".
But the fine was imposed only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $145 million in drug control, development and financial assistance from the United States.
The fines introduced, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings increased, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity so that they could focus on a similar gathering last year to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the conference should proceed and that any remaining thoughts on El Salvador's punishment would be completely eliminated.
Based on the indications of the import of administration positions in the bloc, Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference scheduled for mid-October, the diplomats said.
And without any new strong message or punishment from Washington, the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
For Mr. Bolton, the White House press secretary declined to give details of the debate between the three American officials, along with two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the condition of secrecy.
Their accounts were verified by an outside, but very close, analyst to the administration, who also spoke on condition of secrecy.
The study's background
The next shoe to fall could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller is also investigating whether Mr Trump's campaign with Russia is a sort of attack to take advantage of our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be in front of the voters again and perhaps eventually a panchayat of his own few comrades, then he will have to be accountable.
There are many questions, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor that his peers in Europe are.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1830, if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officials would have been prepared to adopt a dictatorial policy against Hitler.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid so many years of slaughter.
History revolves around such strange turns, and the extraordinary pace of democracy is accelerated or slowed by the
Now America is facing a series of strange twists and turns.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water ever since the newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly suggested recording the president and presumed to be unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times's statement is untenable
How would we respond if the new FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanhoff was not complete or impartial - or was proved untrue in the Supreme Court despite solid charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the middle for a Congress to which Mr. Trump is accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will last for a long winter.
But after the lessons of Prague, I am confident that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, about six years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With my heritage like this, how can I not be optimistic about my future?

Rangers Graham Dorn's Rapid Optimism ahead of the Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna learned on Thursday that after a spectacular draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win against Austria would put them in a strong position to advance from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dornes from making his debut until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result to make the leap to bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal is a very good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get something and came up with a score.
Maybe we would have drawn it in the end, but overall, maybe the draw was a fair outcome.
They were better in the first half and in the second half when we came out we were better.
Thursday, another big European night is here
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last match but, behind us there is a crowd that is with us, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Due to my injuries and all the changes at the club, last year was certainly difficult, but now there is a factor that makes me feel better about this place.
The team is great and the boys are really enjoying it; the practice is also great
Hopefully, we can push ahead this time, we can leave the last season behind us and succeed".
Women are losing sleep for fear of saving for their retirement
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, some were still discussing it with family members
In a nationwide study, almost half of the people said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to negotiate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
Where to Start
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not make your wishes known early, you will not prepare your family for that kind of care
Discuss with your counsellor and family where and how you would like to receive care so that you can determine the costs, as this is an important factor in determining the cost
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you by showing you how to pay for those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that covers these costs or you can self-insure with your own property as long as you have the money.
Get your legal documents out: Stop legal battles
Get a health care volunteer so you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your medical care, and make sure the professional follows your wishes if you become unable to speak.
Also, think about your financial sovereignty
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you, and make sure that you continue to pay your bills even if you become incapacitated
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami killed at least 344 people in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say the death toll is likely to rise further.
Due to communication problems, relief officials were unable to get any information from Dongla Regency, which is north of Paulo and near the magnitude 6.6 quake.
After the disaster, more than 1,800 people were evacuated from the city of São Paulo
Here are some highlights about the island of Palau and Dongola:
Palau is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the Sulawesi Islands, with an estimated population of 31,000 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongla is a regency located 30 km (110 mi) off the coast of the northwest of Sulawesi Island
The Regency, an administrative territory under a province, had an estimated population of 26,000 in 2015.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Gilt mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Emergency Agency, the last 18 years have seen several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala.
In 1936, a tsunami in Dongla killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit western Dongla in 2017 that killed nine people.
Seismically, Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is experiencing a series of earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
24 December: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province, North Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami in 14 provinces, killing 226 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of those killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April
Hundreds of people died in the sinking of the Niaza Island off the coast of Sumatra
2005: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 50,000 people
2005: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,186 people were killed in the riots
2015: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake near Sumatra, on the island of Mentawai, caused a tsunami of up to 60 feet [18 m], destroying more than a dozen villages and killing about 30 people
2015: A devastating earthquake also hit the P.D. Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing people to remember the 2004 earthquake and tsunami and create havoc and terror
No tsunami occurred at the time, but more than 150 people were killed when buildings collapsed.
2017: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 80 people, mostly on the northern side of the island
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded in the city.
Sarah Palin's cousin's eldest son arrested in domestic violence case
Alaska's vice governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Palin, was arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, April 1, Pauline of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested in Shankhrith for domestic violence, harassment and resisting arrest in domestic violence reports.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime, she took the phone from the woman.
Paulin is being remanded to the Mat-Su pretrial facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "guilty, did not plead" when his appeal was asked, according to the network.
Pauline faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning she could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paulin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sera Pauline, called the police to report the attack.
The case is before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence offence reporting, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the Veterans Group in 2016 for her son's violent behavior from his service in Iraq with PTSD.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: the victims were killed
384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Sulawesi, Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication network is likely to be down in the coming days.
The quake slid from Central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video showing the moment of impact is being watched on social media.
When the tsunami hit, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the suspects in the New York City attack.
Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Sefollo Sapov, the suspected perpetrator of the New York City attack that killed eight people, a similar sentence given to anyone since 1953.
Sapov, 30, rented a domestic depot rental truck to attack a bike path along Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, crushing pedestrians and cyclists with the truck.
To complete the death sentence, the prosecutor must prove that it was deliberately committed, and caused mortal harm to the people, to complete the death petition, Southern District, New York.
According to the documents, the death sentence could be imposed by both courts, the court's
Several days after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sapov on 22 counts of murder, conspiracy to commit organized crime by federal prosecutors, and public violence and motor vehicle violence.
The prosecutor said the attack took a lot of planning and thought, and explained how Sapov did this heinous, ruthless and corrupt thing.
"Siflo Habilovevic Sapov has harmed the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angney, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decadate, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Meadowsza and Alejandro Damián Pagnuko", a notice from the Intent State said.
Five victims had come from Argentina to visit.
It has been many years since the death penalty was handed down by the Southern District Court of New York.
Defendant Khalid Burns was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence since 1953 was given in the New York federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple committed 2 years earlier in conspiracy to defraud the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sapov, a resident of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
He told the investigator that he felt better while doing this, the police said.
Sapov told authorities that he got the inspiration to do this from watching ISIS video on his phone, according to the defendant.
He requested to see ISIS's bodyguard at the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty before 22 court logs.
David Patton, one of the government secretaries speaking to Sapov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the decision to criticise.
The demand for the death penalty over life imprisonment is being made because life imprisonment will only hurt the families of the victims, Patton said.
Sapov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP said Nigel Fraze should be put in charge for Brexit.
Nigel Fraze took the oath to form the People's Army today during a Tory conference demonstration.
The UKIP leader said politicians need to 'warm up' from the eurozone - as Theresa May's own MPs suggested that they should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that the UK would have been out by now when Mr Fraze was Brexit secretary.
However, in approving her divisive positions, Mrs May has underlined the inclusion of Jean Remain Tories in a separate challenge against Brexit in the city.
The chief is trying to block his chequers bargaining plan amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remonsters and the EU.
The allies demanded that she move forward with efforts to leave Brussels regardless of the backlash - and work to lift the eurosceptic and power between her bundle and the 'anarchy'.
Mr. Bone told Live Me Live Rally that he wants checkers.
He proposed that Farage should be made a friend and given responsibility for arrangements with Brussels.
If it had been under control, we would have been out by now,' he said.
Wellingbor MP says: 'I'm with Brexit but we need to check the checks'
Establishing his opposition to the European Union, he said: We did not go to fight a world war for the supervivant.
We should make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected proposals that have changed the General Assessment since the 2016 vote. 'The prospect of British individuals changing their views and staying with us is a complete lie.
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was saying to the columnist as well: 'I am essentially saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers are disliked by the entire population, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is disagreeable with our collective and our activists who really pound the boulevards and we are elected in the first place.
Please stop checking and start listening.'
In a directed message to Mrs May, he added: 'The PM keeps doing his job when he keeps his promises.'
Mr Fraze said the rally should have made MPs 'feel warm' at the prospect of closing down that they were going to repeat the elections held in the 2016 referendum.
'It is a matter of trust between the general public - and our political class - about us at present,' he said.
'They are trying to repeat Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you miss it'.
In a message to the excited group he said: I want you to make our political class who are selling Brexit feel warm.
'We are activating the army of the common people of this country who won us over in Brexit and will never rest until we are transformed into a free, self-governing, happy United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, a march was held in Bannerghatta, before a two-hour rally was held in the city centre.
A flurry of activities during this week's gathering swept the Brexit flag against Trez.
Labour colleague Lord Adonize supported them with a motion to assemble, mocking the Conservatives for the security issue.
'It is the general population that reveals to us that they can set up IT frameworks in Ireland with the hope of relying on free-flowing fungi and, besides most Canadian innovation, also for directed outcomes,' he said.
'This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a brilliant Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to take a 'fun look' at the race for president
US Senator Elizabeth Verne said she would "take a tearful turn" on running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
President Donald Trump's incumbent, GOP State Republican, is running for re-appointment on November 1 against Geoff Dyahall, who was co-manager of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the focal point of the theory that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The conference held in Holoke on Friday evening was its 36th meeting in which the HALKE TRID looked at the status of the city's corridor after work.
One participant mentioned whether he wanted to run for President.
Warren responded that now was "the time for women to go to Washington to fix our messy government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest made on the death of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department had sentenced Dietyan Simpson to life in prison, which was confirmed at the 11 a.m. CET news conference on the 20th.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, calling for help in identifying the man found in the footage.
Sims, 20, was killed in a massacre on Friday on the campus of Southern University.
"Wide Sims took a shot to the head and eventually he took a breath", police chief Murphy John Paul told media on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade was moved to protect his partner and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was addressed and he claimed to be at the scene, holding a gun and confessing to Wade Sims for shooting.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who had a childhood experience in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 focuses and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Rusin Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton Group is the centre of world attraction after winning over Sebastian Vettel
From the minute Veltrari qualified for the Butts in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes "would have a huge impact on the group's bid race.
From the bench, Butts got off to a good start and drove Hamilton out to dry as he prioritized the identity of both of his boys and Wettle welcomed his partner to attack.
Vettle first went to the pole and Hamilton was left to keep moving in traffic on the pack's tail, which should have been inconclusive.
Mercedes later made a lap and retreated from the wheel, but Hamilton pushed forward after some wheel-to-wheel activity which saw the Ferrari driver left unconscious and beaten at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the framework and was seventh before the end of the principal lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took a large part of the race to the lead as he set his tires to sink the fast-paced Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He finally came to the wings on lap 44 but Racconen was unable to build his pace on lap eight as he stood fourth.
It's a tough day in light of the fact that Valerie accomplished an incredible feat over the weekend and was a man of his word.
Hamilton said the group has made such two equal to one two.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, saying he did not dismiss a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford for sexually assaulting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanzaa.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that the individuals were "meaningful and terrible and inconsistent".
"One of the things that can happen and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate over the last couple of days is when you get upset, when you see people who are angry and mean and terrible and vague", he said.
"When you laugh at the discharge and the hole and after that they say, 'I didn't do it.'"
I did not do that".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the paper - "He, he, what?
Oh, no. I know.
I did not leak".
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak", he was under the influence of the senator.
Feinstein was described by Ford as the backer of the claims against Kwanhaefe in July and was released by the end of September - although Feinstein denied that he originated from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leave his story", Feinstein told the panel, The Hill reported.
"He requested that I keep it secret and he kept it classified".
But his denial didn't sit well with the president, who commented during a Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what horrible body language that was.
Maybe it wasn't, but it's the most compelling body language I've ever seen".
Moving forward with the Supreme Court challenge, which found the three women responsible for the sexual misconduct, the president proposed that the Democrats were using their own end-of-time claims.
"They are the solution to regain control by any and all necessary means.
You see the filth, the fear, those who hurt them, don't care about them, who need to keep running to get power and power", Mediate told the President.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars offered compensation for the Elite League misfortune on Friday against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win at Agraendra-led Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants score two goals in the face of attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Dwyer led the Giants before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took the home-bat level to the next level.
Two Lux Lundwald Nielsen objectives were previously adjusted for Dundee by Francis Bouchard.
It was the third Elite League period ruin for Adam Caffey's men, who fought back against the famous loser to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Saturday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the time between the two sides with the Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opener came at 3:35 on the fourth minute with the help of Kendall Macphail, assisted by David Rutherford as Beau Wheeler took the lead after four minutes.
In an open-start start, Sullivan led the home team once more after a 13:10 finish as Matty Marquardt moved up to become a supplier for Quinney's equation in 15 seconds.
Dreyer ensured the Giants took a lead in the primary break as he scored his second goal towards the end of the first period.
The home team has been reassembled and re-arranged by Bouchard and the string rules to place 27:37 on the aim of a strategic era.
Coveney and Charles Carr reinforced Nielsen to lead Dundee from the lead for the second time in the frame for the match and he secured the victory with a fifth-placed finish in the final minute of his group.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home to Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies on panlinen to ensure hundreds of people are saved from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a saint for having managed to land a plane safely while addressing several people before dying.
A memorial explosion on the island of Sulawesi on Friday has left more than 800 people blowing logs and many missing after the tsunami.
The area continued to flare up due to strong controversy and several Plues were trapped in the rubble in the city.
But surviving his life regardless of his comrades, 21-year-old Anthony Gunwan Ageng did not leave his post in the uncontrolled influence control tower of the Mutyar Seis Al-Jufri Airport Plu Airport.
They were determined to ensure that Butyk Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was given the option to safely exit.
He shut down the traffic control tower when he thought it had collapsed.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Siriat said the election could have saved many lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Ballikappa in Klimtán to take a large emergency clinic to another city.
Unfortunately we lost him early today so the helicopters came to Plu.
"It breaks our hearts to hear about it", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear the loss of life could reach thousands of people with the country's disaster relief office, which is bound to enter the towns of Dongla, Sigi and Bolong.
"The toll has been accepted to be extended as many bodies were still under destruction, while others were not ready to receive", said office spokesman Suto Purvo Ngoro.
Waves reaching six meters have crushed the Plough which will mass on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are receiving support and supplies.
Reisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing bodies every minute
Clean water is scarce.
Small scale markets are being looted everywhere".
John Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is important to help the survivors but we have no clue what they will find there.
It is now a disaster, although it could be very bad".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo pressed base in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you to stay day and night to complete all the work of evacuating all the people".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was not long ago struck by a devastating shock in the Langebak, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nugini now says one person is missing after a water-filled tanker crashed
An airliner that crashes into a Pacific Ocean bridge in Micronesia is currently said to be missing, after one of 47 people were told earlier and the crew had safely cleared the sinking aircraft.
Hawaiian NewsGenie said in a statement that on Saturday evening, it was impossible to represent a male passenger.
The carrier said it was working with local experts, emergency clinics and agents to try to locate the man.
The carrier did not respond promptly to requests for more information about the passenger, e.g. his age or nationality.
Local forces helped rescue various passengers and groups after the plane crashed while trying to reach the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The aircraft reported that six passengers were staying at the medical clinic on Saturday and each of them was in stable condition.
What is the cause of the accident and the exact balance of probabilities is unclear.
The aircraft and the U.S. Navy said the plane took off in a broken-down hill.
Some witnesses thought the plane had collapsed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had come very low.
"It's a wonderfully rewarding thing", Jane said.
Janes said he and others thought about how to swim the midship through deep water for the crisis problem on a sinking aircraft.
He said the airline's managers were cleaning up and slowing down, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the miners working nearby by improving the water in the Wainfree helped rescue the people by using a transport boat to get them ashore before they were submerged in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 persons have been involved in aircraft accidents designated by the PNG in the last two decades, but none have been involved in aviation.
Analyst burned the woman alive at night on the timeline
The alleged evidence describes the evidence itself Saturday in the retrial of a man convicted of raping a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has long been acknowledged as an expert observer in the field of cognitive analysis.
He imagined for the jury how he used cellphone records to fix the incidents of 29-year-old opponent Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old injured person Jessica Chambers.
Rolette said she had obtained area information from some cellphones, which showed that Tallis was with Chambers the night of her passing, denying her previous cases, Clarice Laser reported.
When she noticed that her mobile phone was with Chambers, during the time she had said she was with her partner Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood up on Saturday and confirmed that he was not around the local area that day.
When the investigator asked if Tallis was cleaning up when he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was lying in light of the fact that my truck was in Nashville.
Another irregularity was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for about fourteen days before he died.
Cellphone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Roulette said that sometime after Chambers passed, Tallis deleted Chambers's writings, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He removed her from his life", Haley said.
The protest aims to start its final moderation on Sunday.
The judge said that he expressed hope that in the early days he should go to the jury for an investigation.
High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A violent trio trio needs to challenge the negative view on the class by infusing their music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol claims that, Guarantee Hip Jump moved away from starting points of political messages and to dealing with social issues.
They need to go back to their basics and they need to be re-informed.
Artists such as Fuji and Common have seen an ongoing revival by craftsmen in Britain, for example, the Acala and the Locke.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny has cashed in a couple for "racist" text job-breaking.
A New York midwife is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misspelled quote that she is "another black man".
The couple denied they were racist, calling the trial similar to "money laundering".
Mother of two, Lindsay Plasco Flaxman, described her dismay when it was revealed in 2016 that Gisele Morais, the new baby's caretaker, had arrived for her first day of work.
"Not just another black person", Ms. Plasco Flaxman wrote in a written note to her family.
However, instead of sending it to his household, he sent it twice to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after a thoughtless mistake, "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flexman fired Miss Morris, who was African-American, on the grounds that the midwife, who was, had done a poor job and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home via Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for six months' compensation of $350 a day for the job she was initially hired for without a fake contract.
She told the Friday Post, "I want to show them, look, you don't do this kind of thing", saying, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered by claiming they were racist and saying that terminating Maurice's job was a legitimate thing to do, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after his crime.
"My landlord sent her something she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
"We are not racist people", said owner Joel Plasco, who told the Post.
Even if it was by mistake, "would you give your child into the hands of someone with whom you are in a relationship?
Your newborn?
Try to understand".
Describing the case as "a money laundering scheme", Plasco said her housekeeper was a baby just two months old and in a "deeply troubled state".
"Are you following a curse?
The man from the capitalist bank said, 'It is not a very good thing to do.'
The public has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, lashing out at them for their behaviour and logic, though the legal case is still ongoing.
The new letter reveals secrets, Paddington publishers feared readers would not tolerate a conversation
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult for the first reader to put himself in someone's situation before it is published.
It is very interesting to know what we know about the great success of Paddington".
He said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "cold sweaty" after his death last year, his father said that having worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work.
She said her father was very proud of his success at the end, Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
He said, "They were very peaceful people, and they were not boastful people".
"But because Paddington was so dear to him, it was just like having a child who had won something: you were proud of them even though it wasn't really your doing.
He saw a kind of success of Paddington that way, I think.
He always gave his credit to Paddington, whether it was his creation or his imagination".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors' efforts to save her life failed.
"Ned was constantly saying it was really bad, he didn't expect to do it", said Mr. Mati Adnan-Laparois.
"Then I got a call from Ned to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I was going to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you very much.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
He was given medication by doctors to pump his heart, and it was gradually leaving his system.
She had died a short time before the attack and it was all coming to an end.
Knowing that it was all opening up, I just had to sit there and wait.
I could not howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to really pick it up".
Finally, now mourning the loss of her daughter, Shri Mati Adnan-Laprauis boarded the plane with the other passengers, knowing the difficult hour she was going through.
He said, "No one knows".
"I lowered my head, and tears were falling all the time.
But it was on the flight, it is hard to describe, I felt this difficult hour of pain for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Postcard of grieving women to stop suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide are working to save others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers on a Welsh bridge so people can call for support.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and ended up committing suicide at the age of 18.
She said: "I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day".
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in Laidney, said his son was a handsome cook with a charismatic smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile would light up any room".
However, he had quit before he died, because he was really in a dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was alone when he learned of his brother's suicide.
"I am always concerned that the impact is going to be a knock-on effect", Mr. Davis said.
Mr. Davis produced the cards, "so that people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not sit in silence - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mr. Davis for years, lost her partner, Mark, at the age of 15, not long after her mother died.
"He doesn't say he was feeling bad or sad or anything", she said.
"We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom of the rock - he did not make eye contact or any contact with the children when they opened their presents".
He said his death was a huge shock to them, but they have to know: "It has made a hole in the family.
It fills us with tears.
But we all need to move forward and fight".

Since the FBI has begun its investigation, Brett Kwanhoff's future hangs in the balance.
"I thought, if we could really achieve something like what he was talking about - the limit of time - the limit of the limit - maybe we could bring some unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, fearing that the council was "going away" between the pro-imperialist pro-Hima-Kushti.
Why do Mr. Kwanhoff and his fellow Republicans not want the FBI to be snooping?
Their hesitation is due to the time.
The November 6 midterm elections are only five weeks away. If, as expected, the Republicans lose badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called to call the senator, and Kwanhoff is being followed to give his endorsement.
What happens after the FBI makes its own report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a single vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kwanhoff could win at least 50 votes on the Senate floor to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The North Korean defector case under Kim has 'fallen'
A South Korean lawmaker said North Korea has been in decline in defector cases since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-Syu Le, citing data from the Southern Integration Ministry, said there were 1,127 defector cases last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the high tariffs for smuggling of people and tight border controls between North Korea and China are the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
In the end, North Dalbadlua is offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Because of the longest border with North Korea and the heavily fortified military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, most people cross through China.
China considers Dalbadlua to be an illegal immigrant rather than a refugee and is often forcibly deported.
Relations between North and South - which are technically on the brink of war - have developed in an effective manner in recent months.
The two leaders met in Pyongyang earlier this month, focusing on the disarmament talks.
In Singapore, it came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula at the highest level.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the lack of progress since then on US sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way in such circumstances that we can unilaterally take the lead in disarmament", Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kwanhoff "hysterical", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanhoff "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Ploisi made the comments at a meeting at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I couldn't understand but thought that if a woman had demonstrated like this, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to Kwanhoff's testimony.
Kwanhoff emotionally denies allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers
During his opening statement, Kwanhoff was very emotional, sometimes crying out during discussions of his family and high school years.
He explicitly denounced the Democrats, calling the charges against him a 'paradoxical and collective character assassination' organized by the liberal anger that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Ploisi said she believed Kwanhoff's testimony proved that she could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that she was biased against Democrats
He said - "I think he disqualifies himself with the things he said and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats".
Ploisi denied when asked whether he would make an ambassador after Kwanhuff is convicted and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not only going to be able to get to the Supreme Court, but they're fine to be in court now", said Plocey.
Kwanhoff is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Plocey said that as a Democrat he was concerned about a possible Kwanhof ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kwanhoff asked whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a heretical, biased person to go to court and be expected to say, 'This is not great'?
And women should take care of it.
months and years of anger, it is a righteous maturity and she cannot achieve it without crying.
Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later, "When we are angry, we cry".
"I don't think that's normal, what do you think?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive, who said that she cries when she is angry, she was telling the person she was talking to, that she developed a technique, which means that when she gets angry and starts crying, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I am angry.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great.
Humbug is allowed as part of an expression of anger because it is fundamentally misunderstood
In a man-led office, one of my greatest memories in my early job, where I once found myself crying in a fit of rage, was being held at my neck by an elderly woman - a shy manager whom I always had a little fear of - who dragged me down the stairs.
He told me, "Never let them see you cry".
"They Don't Know You're Angry
They think you're sad and they're happy because they came to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential tour.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a busy bind on a boat called Monkey Business and was thrown out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
He laughed and told me 30 years later, "It wasn't a well-thought-out decision".
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and their last need was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind in raising money, and she promised that she would not enter the race until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle
He noticed that some of his supporters who gave Marda $1,000 would only give $250.
"I'm not going to be able to do this", she said.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and target representatives rather than the voter, and anger at sexism - she became angry.
Ms. Schroeder was told about how the press reacted to her. "You would have thought I was nervous".
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they're going to put in my grave?
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China was turbulent, and while the fight is not over, experts say that tensions between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing over the long term.
US President Donald Trump had earlier warned of tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum earlier this year.
The most significant increase this week was affected by new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has changed the type every time, recently cutting tariffs by 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth 60 billion US dollars.
China has vowed to fight back against the American defeat and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to shake anytime soon.
Washington's retreat means meeting demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressures of the US trade war could support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic telespin in any country is actually far more dangerous than people have already accepted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank focusing on Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molame said that the situation in the country is improving.
He said, "Today, the situation on the ground is very stable and secure for the progress made in countering terrorism".
Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy
Due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods, they are now offering all conditions for a country that returns refugees voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of 2011.
Six crore people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mohlem said that the Syrian state would have helped in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he insisted that it would not accept unconditional aid or assistance for aid from countries that sponsor the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Goll National outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The crown was withdrawn from Europe because the Danish team captain Thomas Barron had scored 14.5 points to win, they needed to beat the USA.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, threw his T-Shot at the par-3 16th hole in the water and won the match from Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through his entire career, with the current format of the tournament having allowed 1-4 players to go 5-0-0 since its inception in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest ranked player of the European team, Denmark's Throbjor Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Palber who could play in his last Ryder Cup.
With eight Ryder Cups to his credit, Spanish Sergio Garcia was the tournament's top European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a bad year
So I thanked Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am so happy to have my cup back
This is for the team, and I'm happy that I was able to help", Garcia said after the European win, feeling emotional.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
Raham, 23, said: "I think it's great to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him".
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A bizarre statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 titles which is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to play properly except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finu, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furke said after his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these guys, the way they played.
This morning we gave Europe some bumps.
We lost.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will get back together, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 people and I am proud to serve as captain.
You have to tip your cap.
We were defeated".
