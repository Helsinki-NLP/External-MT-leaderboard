Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about being clowns
Some Members of the House are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal is the result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from across the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it might rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole was not satisfied and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (clown).
In this context, the Welsh W is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what the members of the Assembly will be called will of course be a matter for debate by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the possibility of calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option has received greater support in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of MAs and the design of the committee system.
The MAs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the result of the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silenced while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
"Today neither of us are here".
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people regularly attend".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect,  and sooner or later they will go back to where they started".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condos filled with the kind of people who won't help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he says, "and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches close down completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by confraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation that used to worship at a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated web of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by the church's lay leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was trying to offload costs on the parish assembly even though the latter had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of lobster season.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam to him along with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just enthusiasm from catching a lobster but then he realized the boy was screaming I got bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn. He said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but had been declared not to be a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach at Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the UK beauty sector
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with aisles dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialist assistants
As part of the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once devoted to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will take up more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique line of tricks so that most of the products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test the permits at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which it has opened in Croydon, south London, and a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small quantities of food products daily from small neighborhood shops has forced supermarkets to do more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-smooth its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-point pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the programme, with the addition of an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby walks away from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her trendy label to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has run out of time for his Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones, furious after retiring from their lucrative trendy brand business at the last minute to focus on her outstanding new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote to their Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was calculated to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around £11m.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next 20 years.
His decision to quit left all those involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business dealings".
Hard words and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice imitating the "news anchor".
"I have given up nothing".
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "equivalent" response from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"We are getting good results with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have this great relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American troops.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here in front of us", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not want international assistance, so it's a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is continually subjected to, the country remains terribly unprepared for the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
At best, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading to Palu but will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and poured money into roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko's administration as it prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of the religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is tied against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 25 metres from Chelsea's gate, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left-hand ball before he pulled the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and got into the net.
"It was just trying to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I touched it and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled it".
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th-minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue centre forward passed Mateo Kovacic before splashing away near midfield and shooting into the Liverpool midfield.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
So he made a beautiful pass that got Hazard in the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished on the second pole with a left-handed goal over Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Numerous people were reported trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are inviting people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact them.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I would like to call on anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashcam, to contact us because they may have information that is very important for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "It's terrible".
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were inside the delimited area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the last monument to be hit by the wave of "history rewriting"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England's religious and cultural objects by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is the proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many feel should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that rift.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated".
Killer pig slaughters Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood, near a pig in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that in the pig was a large male pig with blood on its face.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250kg pig had slaughtered the farmer, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin identified by the surname Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police gather evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a catalyst.
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious, they don't want to hurt.
"We just have to show them the right amount of respect", he explained.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States .
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5am ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
So, tropical humidity in contact with the approaching hail will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwest area over the next few days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rain may cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert landslides.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of 2.5 to 7.5 cm per hour in some places, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5-10 cm is forecast in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could flood river canyons and thunderstorms could bring gusty winds and dust.
The approaching looting will cause heavy local rainfall on parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm is possible, which could cause limited debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature swings over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central United States will occur on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the heat from the summer will try to rise and expand again.
A warm start to October is forecast for much of the central and eastern United States, with 26°C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
New York City is expected to experience temperatures of up to 26 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a strong probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the heart-pounding deposition by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute twist Friday: an arrangement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during a fiery deposition, said he was 100% sure that this hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen indicated on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the viewers who watch the shows in the offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience similar to a football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning being insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes as he was reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, 'You have power while many women are impotent.'"
Flake said his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
All the cable networks and broadcasters were live-streaming a few hours later when the Justice Committee voted to put Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the assurance that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans of letting the European Union "make politics" with Britain's future and jeopardise the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a separate interview with the Prime Minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers deal for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective tariffs is "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrest suspect in the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities have released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the crime and said they detected Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
Bail has been set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge medical examiner's office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the work of the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the Police Science Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade stated that the team is "dismayed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano strewn with ash Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking for various tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity around the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on roads that are usually overcrowded with tourists.
Further clashes occurred during the day with police using handcuffs to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of independenceists chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independent region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a referendum by violent clashes that were taking place at polling stations across the region.
The pro-independence groups had camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked", he explained.
Despite winning a decisive but measured victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's best-known leaders now in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the 'violation of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government', he explained.
London: Men arrested after car bombing
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack sealed the Livingston 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston sealed the victory .
The promoted Livingston stunned the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's team won promotion to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remain without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will have to face Hearts next Sunday, which separates them by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers played Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its winning streak in the division, going undefeated for six games, with coach Holt yet to see a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's wasting his chances against some unimpressive guests.
Holt's team should have been in the lead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out the door after he got in to meet Craig Halkett's headshot from the other side of the door.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could trouble the visitors with kicks.
And that is how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who was able to score from the center of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but the home team's defense had proven impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have to worry too much.
This pattern held through the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game.
The crosses took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for rigor, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand foul, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Up to the last player, they've been exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have changed very little since their return to the top flight, but Holt has a lot of credit for how he's been able to boost the team since his arrival.
She's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performances at some points with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
They missed the last leg - only once did they manage to penetrate the opposing zone - and this can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) at the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at straightening relations between NATO allies.
They clashed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population group outside of Turkey.
Police have justified the security intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have turned up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the dissent from a visitor who was considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford street in the city's south-east area, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car pulled over and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metro police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads and buses have been blocked and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded during riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security men's prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado agents were employed to handle the riot, which involved eight inmates and is confined to one ward of the prison.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to longer prison terms".
Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had to be treated in hospital following an attack on a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot police were called in to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the last of Hurricane Rosa's forces pass through the southwest desert, creating the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as far south as eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday night in rainy weather.
Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas not at risk of flash floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the south-west area is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing a period of extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be on land through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds peaking at 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, losing power.
So it's expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Between 7.5 cm and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression, then heading through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that Rosa or its remnants may cause is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwestern United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that such rains could generate potentially lethal flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous land.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Authorities are appealing to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the evil and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and forcefully denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in his defence.
The President said Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with an unparalleled record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really busy, he said.
"For this lottery, I'm going to be hard at work for exceptional candidates".
Trump has declared that Democrats are committing to "resist and obstruct".
The first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and casualty numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu City on Friday, when waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) slammed onto the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people, killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "have been totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard on the top floor of a building shouting in a heated way to warn people in the street below of the coming tsunami.
A few minutes later a wall of water crashed onto the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for emergency use only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to over 800.
It's awful.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala managed to reach Palu City safely, where employees took refuge under waxed canvases in their office yard, they encountered devastation scenes along the way, Doseba said.
"I was told that I saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's awful.
Even as the rescue teams began the difficult rescue gear-starting operations, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but the status has not been defined yet.'
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that ease the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a baby was pulled from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran of the paragliding industry, I am carrying my emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread within the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man snuck up behind Brink's employee and stole a bag with the money for the delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the offenders is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Saturday, he tweeted: "The person formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she will be presenting her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word holds a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye -- the reflection of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he will never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly student grants and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for IIA
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by various US government groups about AI, although there is generally no formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it aims to be the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new AI revolution", said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big success in the AI sector being in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American player Otello with the highest score and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, so that we can identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the leaders in academia, it's the multinationals", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US give a boost to its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI", he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of a special commission on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US scheme to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on a possible change of the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has declared that he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that turnout will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is as follows: 'Do you agree with NATO and EU membership and with the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have declared that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name to open the door to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to the polls on Sunday.
Of these 57%, 70% said they would vote for the proposal.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal by sidestepping the entire Brighton defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's defence during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the free-throw line.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot into the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about letting him play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he could score at that moment".
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's field.
He sent a nice filter ball down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward hit the net just before he left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force a fresh start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have clinched at least one comeback with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they're still hoping to get their first division title.
"Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will be playing will probably be at the highest level of the whole year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they're reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be a 34th-time starting pitcher, performed a pitching session on Thursday and would be a starting pitcher on his regular Sunday off.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really working on it so I'm fighting for excellent candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you can see the evil, the petty.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm to get power and control back, because that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, had given themselves the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And we've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, bad, mean and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, sparking strong whistles among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a -- that was bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not very tolerant any more.
He doesn't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't much of a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they have said what they thought.
My colleague Joan Ryan has been treated in a similar way because she has been a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a member of parliament for the local Labour party, Friday night meetings have been exactly like this.
However, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a 'more kind and courteous' policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable or not to the party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of course on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow me with insults and derision on social media calling for my resignation, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I am certainly more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me tend to be political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
Over the last two years I have been given many advice, telling me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government which had left my secondary school class literally in pieces, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family nucleus, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defence of what I believe to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow upset the final score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's championship day.
They're now top of the league, the only undefeated team in ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", the coach said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to give Ayr credit, they took better advantage of our opportunities".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climo increased Ayr's distance with a rigour before, just at half-time, to score and then convert a goal on his own to bring Ayr to 17-5 at half-time.
But the Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was made to lie down, and at the restart, Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted from Climo.
Ayr's alternate captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of high pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a no-ball match against Climo, from the touch of rigour, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the struggling Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the ball from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran decided to move into the hotel business after discovering he'd been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the show's final and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wished to become involved in Glasgow's 'prosperous restaurant business'.
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a seamless naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To get it back is a duty".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline now in Chile's hands after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude", Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, explained.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia's demand that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile be obliged to negotiate, granting Bolivia a way out of the state's jurisdictional sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will hardly rule in favor of Bolivia and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final ruling indicates that the case "wasn't complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has thwarted any remaining goodwill in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions after what happened.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity in its relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of disagreements to their mutual advantage, he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen without trust in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He explains that it is an illusion that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the statement without Pyongyang first carrying out major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show the latest trends in huge headlines that will soon be in a high-end store near you
If you want to expand your headgear collection or completely block out the sun's rays, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of crazy oversize head covers for their 2019 spring-summer collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unconventional hats have been making a splash on Instagram this summer, and these designers have been posting their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that submerged the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a loose ice cone.
And if you go on with the huge style statements, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge hats could come to you on the high-fashion streets.
The outsize hats are coming in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a width of over a meter that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has overwhelmed social media has sent another huge creature onto the runway: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model who wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's 2019 spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I predict these big hats and beach bags will be arriving in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and in demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message will reach his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages scored highest.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students scored highest with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish scored highest.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject choice are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees gave for the difficulty in filling jobs were 17% attributable to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools with specialised teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
It cannot be denied that at this moment, in a global trading system, languages remain fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it has yet to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly matches to prepare for it", he said.
The time of the rally is a Trump West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia with a flurry of rallies.
This is the first of five rallies planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump will seek to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's rally and how can you follow him online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the YouTube live stream.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who face the November election get some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign has said that these five rallies over the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into the busiest campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, the Saturday afternoon quartets might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept that players believe in as firmly as ever in races like this.
Where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is obviously ahead, four points ahead with another 12 at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of a wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the score at game four, when he and Thomas were down two points after two.
His putt that won them the game at the 15th hole was met with a similar outcry, which tells you he thinks the American team is not out of the race yet.
"You really have to worry about your game", Spieth said.
That's all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unchallenged version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to throw a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That route, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, the European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to catch up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogey on the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could not even remotely climb out of.
Yet on Sunday there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the way strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe 10-6 ahead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The USA held out the most in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to recover the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and rookie American Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5&4.
Woods, who was out for two games on Saturday, showed occasional sprints of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourball, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and number three.
Europe has not yet achieved all the results it hoped for on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for Americans with two points Saturday.
They secured a gritty 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having missed the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to go to singles, though as the defending champion, Furyk's team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was exacerbating the country's distrust of the US, which would under such circumstances refuse absolutely to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any satisfactory response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm first".
Although Ri reiterated the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization that would be rewarded to North Korea on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal agreement to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for loosening the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need for 'denuclearization first' and to increase the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way and even opposes the 'declaration of end of war', Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust".
Ri did not refer to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister pointed to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be at this point".
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korean missiles after the evil president Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely" destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said much more still needs to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no deadline, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Respect for the Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without exception until complete, final and assured denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He returned from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing "gangster requests".
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took "compliant measures".
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged to Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to get more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights fueled by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the world's top university often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only being told this now, when I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the "importance of sleep", which surprised me very much, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes and books so they can learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how lack of sleep in the long term can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "pride" linked to "sleeping at night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Getting enough and good quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon to fight stress, exhaustion, anxiety, he explained, and should even help prevent weight gain as lack of sleep puts the brain in a sluggish mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the chemistry and physics biology department, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men out of the game
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager leaving his side eight points behind the reigning Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and a Rangers formation short of inspiration never looked able to tie.
While the Ranger are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, and only behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be more trouble coming for the Rangers after guard Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from an apparently thrown object outside the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual lineup that ripped a point from the Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-prepared team smothered their opponents every round.
The Rangers may have dominated by possession but Livingston made better use of the balls at their disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filtering pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward towards Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder squandered the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his teammate on defense Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took over but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their play in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should see a penalty at the end of the fifteenth after a clash with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
Rangers managed to get only two shots in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't let himself be bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it for his efforts alone.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a kick placed deep into Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm in choosing Menga for a clean finish.
Gerrard acted during the half replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch had an almost immediate impact as the wing put a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly jumped from the goal line to block it.
But the Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor fought back to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton filed a final request for severance after a crossover with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTENT continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", played by those uncredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "Say a little bit, it's really bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days shy of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
They can then see a protein common to many types of cancer and then they are re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then injecting those cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein promotes the growth of several types of tumors, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal tumors, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches into a pro-Trump diatribe by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled into the studio during an episode of Saturday Night Live after an unfinished performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist!'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
SNL kicked off the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against the sexual assault allegations filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the recording of West's flip was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to fool West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his hood.
"I was bullied backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And so they told me I was an outcast", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and he said, "I'd wear the Superman coat because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper, "A deadly silence fell on the studio".
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with a performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HAVING TAKEN THIS TO THE MASS".
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what he is and that's just wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing a vomit-inducing ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we,'" he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now the person previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of Throne of Swords Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen grounds often make kids believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt something had gone wrong and reflected on how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Throne of Swords co-star, 31, admitted to being quite concerned about this issue.
'I am personally concerned, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be this particular way of being a man?
I think that's one of the great dilemmas of our time -- how can we change things?
Because obviously something has gone wrong with the young.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be performing any prequels or sequels to Throne of Swords once the series ends next summer, saying that he has "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a burglar.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to Throne of Swords.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on", he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
In some regions of China HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within such intercourse.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data, and speaks of "dangerous" secrets and "conspiracy theories".
The US congresswoman denounced on Saturday the accusations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three US Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were encouraged by opinion leaders and ultra-right-wing websites.
"Lies, lies and even despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released online Thursday, by an anonymous person at the Capitol during a hearing of a panel of experts on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information about a member of Waters' staff.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie".
Waters's claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
"That implies that he has no character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the prosecution's reasoning.
You must remain calm and serene".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by detractors of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Huge if confirmed", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all my staff".
Johnny English's review is still striking - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become commonplace now to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
The veiled self-deprecating about how bad we are will be the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbit has gotten his license to screw things up a second time - and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comic creation developed for non-English-speaking movie-going countries.
Obviously it's the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims to glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that type who contributed a single note to the theme moments of Gloria at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the traveller and mysterious international man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving the chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this latest Johnny English outing.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly slamming against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems quite understated and strangely superfluous, particularly now that brands of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as Atkinson's gags in the silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of timeliness that is unchanging now is that Britain is in serious danger.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy web, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agent in charge, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the trickle-down moment for a haughty, tormented prime minister who's already suffering a setback of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character but there's not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call someone back who is already retired.
And that means that the untrained Johnny English, who now works as a school administrator in a fancy factory, but also gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock-style espionage course.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his suffering former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a high-society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So the Batman and Robin of disaster for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the net of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates sheer anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the final sequence, but as neat and exuberant as it is, there's quite a bit of children's TV throughout the story.
It's all pretty modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to allow British people to work four days a week and be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like to see the heads of companies transfer the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, with the same pay.
Some sources have said that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day workday was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year, a review of the policy is expected to be announced".
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and its industrial strategy as a whole.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not currently enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy line and is not currently under discussion.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic sphere.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless executives" and "speculators" in public service enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire share package, as the Labour government may implement deductions on the basis of conduct deemed unlawful.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 per cent of the net worth of private sector firms to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the government agency's findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to uncover anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said it on the way to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that the accusation had come out, I said, "Did you do it?"
It was resolved, determined, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, by the way, seems carved into the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever you appointed couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in the change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees a remarkable star-studded lineup perform and has an equally remarkable mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or actions such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to request a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called clicktivism - people who feel they're really making a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million shares of its supporters, used for a variety of purposes.
It says these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that hedge funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership committed to helping children grow to their full potential, with a pledge to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, which asked: What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among those performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to implement 'blockade' and hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he would have said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade so that their energy is not put on the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the 'voice of energy consumers' in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "not very versatile" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The United States' position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see it as a big problem that a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our broken government back together, and that means having a woman in charge", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During the town meeting Warren spoke his mind on President Donald Trump, declaring that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "It's natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think he should run in 2020.
58 percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a nomination.
The poll found greater support for a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in terms of a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD of Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's come back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers come back with", he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there's that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have devoted themselves to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence and drug-related firearm possession report, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Childcare Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and her violent gang-member children abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing rampant gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to file an asylum claim.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle", states the amicus curiae memorandum.
In the brief, prosecutors also objected that the policy of banning immigrants from the United States harms the economy, stating that there is a clear likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and provide needed labour.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is open to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fears of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said on 11 June, as part of the announcement of the policy line.
The preschool was never meant to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more desperate.
"There is a lot of tension", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
There's an ambulance carrying bodies at all times.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their ragged personal effects, in an attempt to retrieve whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured shoulder and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuing strong tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with advertising propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid ad in the Des Moines Register - the highest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election highlighted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, is now ramping up those bullies by running advertising on our free newspapers.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's beloved tradition of free speech and the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, in the street talk here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers had evaded an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and standing by him in dealing with various sexual harassment allegations, analysts have signaled that we will see a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to proceed with a vote.
"You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate chamber, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is skyrocketing", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they may be higher, especially among undecided suburban electors and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote despite disliking the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that there might have been a backlash if Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"The GOP has become a confused whole", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated him", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents have certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party while she was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that traces its origins to Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online personal data warehouse or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring in the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers on staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely derailed overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victorian Cross for the Clergyman of the Great War
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honour.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through a thick fog, under heavy fire from the camp and war machines.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest gallantry advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never live up to and something that makes it more humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt really honored to play a role in the parade and added that the value of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given to him by so many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine for a moment, you stayed up all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied a view of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some have been left low after staying up until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, one fan described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad joke".
"The government's policy is that at 6 a.m. that content is no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
"Pig's feathers", yeah.
 Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to find a solution until Sunday in our time zone, Monday in theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages coming in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six -- as we normally do -- and we've been trying to get as much for the fans, and we just talked about it.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off due to illness.
Introducing himself as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley stated that he felt "less than anyone else" as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of being less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and the energy to be successful".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - caught him by surprise.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who's 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at a young age - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, of a baby boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I was going to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 already - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be around so you can be in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn't realized he wasn't invincible yet", he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the build-up to the Olympics and still makes him feel bad.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-shape Mickelson was benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often has been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his game in the ring, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnected course regularly punishes misses.
And if the path itself wasn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of their 12 singles matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, he slapped me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.
Mickelson on Sunday will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, though Furyk said his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the boardroom", he explained.
I also think the younger players have had fun trying out against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did more than play.
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can quickly fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual events of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point lead from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but only by a small margin", said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 class win, Friday 5 to 3 and yesterday 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
You gotta go out there and do it right.
It's not over until the dots are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try and win the trophy, and that's what we have to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world.
Happy with the way his family competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I could never have gotten better.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performances, which is something else.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're alone your golfing skills are put to the test.
That's the message we need to get to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go there and bring out the best in himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be looking for the best individual performance rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides of those big matches on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but we want to start right away with the right foot like we did in Brookline and Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So let's organize our training accordingly and classify the kids in the way we see fit, because tomorrow we're going to try to do magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counter-attack and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the journey to the end", said Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again
According to local media, the latest German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era military ships, but will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and a spike in costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues following delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to deploy new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will become obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial software and hardware flaws that rendered the ship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half the staff of the older Bremen class ships.
In addition, it was found that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent alarms about the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the navy actually lacks vessels capable of being used.
The official stated that the matter has worsened considerably over time, as the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ones.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class have been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to obtain food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals in existence and guide future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as brown earrings and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Analysis of the recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined dramatically over the past century.
Bat species are at risk from construction and development work affecting the three species and destroying their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-killing paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The National Traffic Safety Service, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the three-poles and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first bat-only reserve at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal territory.
"We have a large bat area here in Threave", he said.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.
It stresses the importance of bat control before maintenance on property, as the accidental destruction of a single maternal bat may kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to get publicity" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel which published the charges.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday the alleged payment of $375,000 to keep quiet about what happened.
In a video on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the statements as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is false, says the five-time Ballon d'Or face to the camera.
They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the game.
I'm happy and everything is fine", the footballer added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for moral damages in proportion to the seriousness of the breach of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The incident is alleged to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly entered the soccer player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo would have knelt after the incident saying he was 99 percent a "good guy" disappointed by the 1%.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a reconciliation agreement because she felt "terrified by the retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the agreement, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Juventus of Italy with a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK 'could forever regret' losing its status as the world's leading carmaker following Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also said he was 'concerned' about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary shutdown of production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Secretary Clark.
The Japanese carmaker argues that delays at the borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced some 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
Concerns are growing among other British carmakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on how crossborder trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the supply chain risks faced by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of the just in time concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be border disruption causing delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "thought through with precision to avoid these border discomforts".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production might stop but warns that, in the long run, additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant's union delegates, says that workers are very concerned: 'In my experience, once jobs are cut, they are not reinstated'.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed" by a week, as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, fueled months of gossip in Washington.
Later that month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there was a rumor that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI investigative questioning against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be postponed for another week considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll keep the press updated.
Some journalists might dispute this statement: Sanders hasn't held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television journalists showing up, although he said: "I don't disagree with them showing up".
He suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We checked the numbers".
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, like we've been doing for the last few weeks, and this will replace the press briefings and you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the President may have demonstrated the reason for this by making a free-wheeling, yet bizarre, speech to a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to European workers at the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them well to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in the decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to decisions in the autumn.
But the British Government has also prepared for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
I therefore wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
Technical Director Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came close to the edge of the field and passed out", Reed said.
First responders and medical staff administered Abercrombie oxygen on the spot, before putting him in a stretcher and taking him away for further checks.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "we don't have any information yet on the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Labour plans.
The manoeuvre will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury is planning to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could be more than 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the housing market.
Many of the country's wealthier areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp tax to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's 'housing disaster'.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of striking proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the elimination of wrongful evictions.
He also wants to give the council more powers over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a house was as easy for non-UK residents and for foreign companies as it is for resident UK workers.
For many people the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland's technical director Jack Ross says his "highest aspiration" is to eventually become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of re-electing the North-East side who are currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being at the helm of St Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in Series B and that's it", Ross told the BBC's Scottish programme Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he feels no anxiety about following such big names into an equally big team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to get the team back into the Premier League".
"Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back on track.
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as Hearts assistant manager.
He then helped Alloa to save themselves from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from the edge of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more at ease now than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
This was probably a real turning point, he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
I really thought the manager role was meant for me, more than the player.
It seems strange because I've worked well, I've earned a living and I've had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with on a weekly basis.
I'm still dealing with it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job but the management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct, and now that I'm doing it, I feel much more at ease than I've ever felt in my life.

According to one study, the best time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more income to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy firm CGA, put the data together and commented: The persistence of the sun and England's long stay at the World Cups meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit the hardest.
The drop of 1.8 per cent in catering in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where most people drink were the strongest, with a more uniform increase than the decline in restaurants.
The pubs where you eat have also suffered from the heat, though not to the extent of the restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and entertainment industry analyst, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual decline in sales will be particularly severe in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant industry and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us the necessary respite.
Global pub and restaurant sales growth, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sales tracker Coffer Peach Tracker compiles and analyses performance data across 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social network account that they hide from their parents
One survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social network accounts that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content will be posted
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, set up social network accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" account to show to their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager urging others to "rape" me.
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board at the national general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and chairman Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could benefit enormously by bringing her on board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: 'I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland'.
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four-time Olympic gold medallist, and now a BBC commentator, has been unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He had tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a tiring job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!
A tickle commercial compares mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A milk producer has shared the opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as the world's first silent wearable jogger, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of a hilarious music video to show the freedom of expression given to mothers by the new jogger.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm getting milk but I don't have a thing" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't breasts but my tits".
The chorus goes on: "Take it out, take it out, feed the children, take it out, take it out, I'm giving milk to my ladies".
However, the advertisement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has elicited mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom have argued that it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within days of birth, someone wrote.
Elvie the tirante is discreetly worn under a mommy bra
Another commented: Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a carrot for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?
Another added: "It's really a pointless advertisement.
Others have defended it, and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd want one.
When I used the tirattata, I felt just like a cow.
The advertising is a little irreverent but it's not far from reality.
This is a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny commercial for moms who use the tiramisu (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'"
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the protagonists show that they danced with the discreet pull-up in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the tiratté feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be tucked into a breast-feeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while they are sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie tiramisu is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the cow-paddle we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new paddle can provide".
This isn't the first time Elvie the bouncer has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up on the runway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policy line has made it harder to take care of these children.
Most of those who took them in were generally illegal immigrants who now fear jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential dependents and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take in children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who offer to adopt children or are family members of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're still hunting these people", Albence said.
In an effort to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some children will have to appear in court within a month of being arrested, instead of 60 days, which was the standard period before, according to those working in the shelters.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer children stay in foster care, the greater the risk of suffering from anxiety and depression that cause violent tantrums or attempted escape, according to those working in the shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Proponents of this view say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure such as the Tornillo one where, precisely because of its size, it is easier to ignore the children's distress signals.
They add that moving children to the campground without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have been displaced.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are favourable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "instilling unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return", he said.
"What should be a humanitarian issue is being politicized".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed that the agreement has "specific deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency is to end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential end ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of any decline in the audience.
Since 2014, first-night ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers on its first night, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed network ratings by reaching 3.5 million viewers on the nights with the most important news stories.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something that can be explained", says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's "Designated Survivor", which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh".
So chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of the events in Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether or not immigrant families will be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
But stopping to watch the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond its duty as an informed citizen to find itself following for the sixth straight hour a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's extensive research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of tracery", commented The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' disgusting descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for example, can't watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what it does feels like a reality show is that every night there's new stuff", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the casting and daily developments of the plot of the Trump show (in contrast to the NFL praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the north shore of Kauai, and even though it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in his house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Foreign money inflows in the run-up to the closest midterm elections
It's no surprise that the 17th district is experiencing a cash flow from the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two incumbents to now be running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the Pittsburgh suburban district brings Democratic Representative Conor Lamb into the picture, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in the old districts the electoral college had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political opinioners gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought of penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, but then changed their minds.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made clear that they intended to proceed with the conference, thereby definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been assigned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of reprimand or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the internal decisions.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who, however, wished to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report he will release, Special Counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact for which there now appears to be sufficient evidence.
According to reports, Mueller's investigation is meant to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress goes to the Democrats, Trump would have to answer these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new run.
The unknowns are many, and I do not mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we're going to have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed on that occasion, by passing up the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, at which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of them right now.
What if Trump decides to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that he secretly suggested last year that Trump be intercepted, questioning his ability to fill the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the story in The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and perjury?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, are we going to vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we're gonna make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With a legacy like this, I can only be optimistic about the future".
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win over the Austrians, after a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them a great chance to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game convinced we were doing well and we took home a point.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to get the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have got a good result in the last game but I am sure that thanks to the support of the public we will not be disappointed.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level itself but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in good shape, the kids are having fun, and the preparation is going well.
So we can forget about the problems of last season and think about the future".
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although those surveyed have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the subject in the family.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent say they've talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, "people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have that conversation".
That's where we start.
You cannot prepare your family for your assistance if you do not communicate your wishes in time.
If you have a counsellor, decide with him and your family members where and how you want to receive help, because these factors can be a determinant of costs.
Get a financial adviser involved. He or she can advise you on how to pay your expenses.
The choice of a long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with a redemption value to cover these costs or continue to pay for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary paperwork to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that someone you trust can oversee medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid in case you are unable to do so.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in any danger to his life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications are down and rescue officials have been unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also a major activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coastline killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her phone from her hand.
Palin has been transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail has been set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the TV network, he appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree criminal mischief, which carries a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of a crime report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks are down and the toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off Central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking extraordinary capital punishment for the suspects in the NYC terror attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the terms of the death penalty request in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and also "intentionally" inflicted grievous bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges could result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder in the first degree, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a real planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, offence and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was proud of what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea and life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier pleaded with prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE must lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilize the people's army" at a protest at the Tory conference today.
When a member of parliament from Theresa May's party suggested that he should take on the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians must "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would "be out of Europe already" if Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party were highlighted by the Remain Tories who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan to the attacks of the Brexiters, the Remainers and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
"We'd be out of Europe by now", he said.
Wellingborough added: "I'm for Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining his reasons for opposing the European Union, he stated: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our own country".
Bone rejected the notion that public opinion would change after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling the Prime Minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and it does not enjoy the favour of our party and our activists who are walking the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a poignant message to May, he added: "Prime ministers can keep their seats when they keep their promises".
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow it".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the people's army of this country who voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tories against Brexit flags after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's all a sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator on Saturday spoke about her future at a town meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The possibility that he could challenge Trump in 2020 has been in the air for some time.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she would run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix the government and that means a woman holding the highest office".
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. today on ETNews.
On Friday, he had posted a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-3 junior from Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday in front of fellow driver Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's orders would heavily affect the race.
From pole, Bottas started well, leaving Hamilton to defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the tail of the group traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes made the stop the next lap, re-entering the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent the pass inside, risking to end up out after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the gearbox and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by taking fourth place.
In the end, however, he must make the pit stop on lap 44 and in the remaining 8 laps he is unable to increase the pace and overtake Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri has worked really well all weekend and he was really nice to let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to take first and second places", said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting she had not disclosed the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "petty, mean, and liars".
"What can happen and what's been happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and liars", he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is being spread and the people responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you break the news?
Do you remember his answer, did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't".
Hold on a second.
We revealed it... No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies the indiscreetness was leaked from her office.
"I did not conceal Professor Ford's allegations, but I did not reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did".
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the petty, the mean, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to regain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have bounced back from Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the comeback match 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went straight in with a two-goal lead on shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who had come back from a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
The two teams have met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute on an assist from Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled down after four minutes on an assist from David Rutherford.
In what was a rather lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie's tie-breaker assist at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team re-compiled and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic manoeuvre in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which took Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died allowing a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a result of a powerful earthquake that hit Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the fearfully swaying control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
So he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It is really sad news for us", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Management Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explains.
Waves as high as 20 feet have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarket stores are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now says one person is missing after lagoon crash
The airline of the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board including passengers and crew members were able to escape, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini's news updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were able to rescue the other passengers and crew after the accident occurred while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to hospital Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim the plane crashed into the lagoon because it failed to reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane overran the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"And it was really a blessing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes later explained that he and others, by walking through the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was hit slightly in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier also came to the rescue using a rubber dinghy to carry people ashore before the plane sank into about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline aircraft accidents over the past two decades, but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
The presentation of evidence for the prosecution in the new trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 concluded on Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several cell phones that prove that, contrary to her claims, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth about being in the Sanford truck that night, he confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is Tellis claiming to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
But the cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge is scheduled to pass the verdict to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by putting positive messages in their songs.
Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its roots when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the roots and do a conscious hip-hop kind of thing again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to figures such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" text.
In New York City a nanny sued a couple for discriminatingly firing her after she received a text message by mistake in which her mother complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the request to a full-blown "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, "embarrassed" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, saying she was unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
You paid Miss Maurice for the day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, she is seeking beauty compensation of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work she was initially hired to do, even though without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by claiming that firing Maurice was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife texted you saying something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so".
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't go at a person like that.
It's not very nice", the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media, sharply criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success of Paddington".
Saying that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the toy bear-inspired children's book, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father was modestly proud of her success.
"He was a fairly quiet man, not a conceited person", he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like a son who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not your own.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success that way.
Though it was a creation of his own imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself".
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my dying daughter.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really bad and that our daughter would not make it", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me that she would die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while ago and that was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew", he says.
"All I did was cry my head off.
It's hard to explain, but as I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent others from committing the same act.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said it lit up every room he went into".
But before he died, he quit his job because depression had taken him "to a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he killed himself.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that there will be a chain effect".
He created the cards "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to for help, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk".
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never said that you felt down or depressed", she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
"He hit rock bottom on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he avoided looking them in the eye".
She says that her death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "It tore the family apart.
He tore us apart.
But we had to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain, the FBI has opened an investigation
"I think if we could proceed as you asked, that is with an investigation limited in time and scope, we could reach an agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "losing its cool" because of the blockade by entrenched supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
With only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6, if the Republicans, as predicted, come up short, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators in to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes its report?
The vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear yet if Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the deadlock and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says that refugees were 1,127 last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally take these people out.
Pyongyang has not issued any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work together to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without trust in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and argues he is not fit for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not characteristically fit to hold the office.
Pelosi made the comment Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved the same way, they would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly moved, Kavanaugh denied the accusation that he sexually molested Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so overwhelmed with emotion that he almost cried and cried as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats who called the allegations against him a "coordinated, absurd smear campaign" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't get on the Supreme Court because he's shown a bias against Democrats.
"I think he's shut himself out with his statements and the way he's talked about Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats should win a majority in the House.
"I think if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not fit for the Supreme Court, but he's not fit for the court that he's presiding over now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said that "You can't send a hysterical and biased person to the Supreme Court and expect this decision to be welcomed in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of tantrums that she can't get out of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, is it?"
And she went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad".
And so he kept going.
I thought it was a brilliant idea".
Tears are tolerated as an outburst of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office is when I once started crying from a fit of rage, and a woman older than me, a cold manager who I had always been a little scared of, grabbed me by the collarbone and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not try running for president herself.
"It was not really a well-thought-out decision", he told me, laughing about it 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the running and we definitely didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was behind on fundraising and vowed she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause from the start.
She found that some of the supporters who had given male candidates $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion (gratefulness for the people who had supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to get money and voters than representatives, and anger at the sexual discrimination she was subjected to), that she was moved.
"It was like I was in a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my headstone.
Maybe "She cries a lot".
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the US-China trade war have been fierce, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year by taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of goods, which means taxes will be levied on half of the goods coming from China.
Beijing has responded each time with measures of the same kind, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to fight back against the US one blow at a time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will back down anytime soon.
For Washington to give up, it would have to give in to its demands, but publicly bending to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US may have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for economic collapse in both countries is actually far more dangerous than has been acknowledged so far", argues Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime will gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid from those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the 16th hole of the par 3 by conceding the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to record a 5-0-0 since the current format was first contested in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the lower ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team with a score of 5&4.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, has given up 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played eight, became the most winning European player in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have won the cup again.
It is a victory for the team and I am happy to have contributed", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his fellow countryman John Ram who beat the legend of American golf Tiger Woods with a score of 2 and 1 in Sunday's singles.
"If I think I grew up watching his matches, I'm really very proud to beat Tiger Woods", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws in his Ryder Cup appearances.
A strange statistic when you consider that he's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been trying all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have done very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
We put everything into it.
But they played better than us".
Red tide update: concentration is decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, spotted flowering conditions, suggesting a decrease in concentration, are evident in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spots are located about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, we reported a mean concentration in Pinellas County or off its coast, a low to high concentration in Hillsborough County, a bottom concentration to a high concentration in Manatee County, a bottom concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coast, a bottom concentration to a medium concentration in Charlotte County, a bottom concentration to a high concentration in Lee County or off its coast, and a low concentration in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
While last week no cases were reported in northwest Florida.
