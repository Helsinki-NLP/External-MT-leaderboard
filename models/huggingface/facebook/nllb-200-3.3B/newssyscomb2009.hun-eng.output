Right-wing populists win in Austria, 29 percent overall
The first preliminary results of the Austrian early parliamentary elections on Sunday show a marked weakening of the two parties in the grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered particularly heavy losses.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a victorious return to national politics.
Preliminary results show the country's strongest party, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), with 29.8 percent of the vote, but a loss of 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote, with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results in the post-war history of both major parties in Austria, and especially for the People's Party, which has been promoting early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ in public opinion polls.
But the voters clearly punished him for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the possible resignation of party leader and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely outcome of the election, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strength of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) gained 18% of the vote and the BZÖ 11% of the vote - the Social Democrats, however, expressed fears about a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed to a coalition government with the populists (the FPÖ was then still united, but in 2005 it left BZÖ), which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared his willingness to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Greens were also elected to parliament, but they lost some popularity and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties passed the four percent threshold and did not enter Parliament.
India's relations may cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists being charged with illegal insect hunting is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that a certain cooling off in Czech-Indian relations could ensue.
The minister made the announcement in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee today.
"If this were not to be resolved, then yes, there would be a certain cooling off", he concluded after the meeting, which was held at the Czech instigation.
Mukherjee said after the trial that the executive branch has a hard time interfering in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved", the minister said.
However, Mukherji believes that the best thing for Emil Kucera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for bail and await the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg testified that his partner expressed similarly during the trial.
"He has recommended an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to acquit him", said the Czech diplomatic chief.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convict with "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister mentioned.
However, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance to them.
'Our main interest is to preserve the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that", Schwarzenberg noted.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he emphasised to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
On the question of whether India had promised to deal with the case, the minister avoided answering.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises", he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
You enter the wall of the electronic map showing Australia and the neighboring sea areas.
But he's not interested in the continent. He's interested in a speck that disappears into the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the neighbouring seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division's 30-member Working Group on the Law of the Ocean.
Its head, Václav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer and director of the division, is attentive to the explanation, which he sometimes adds to.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed is a world rich in natural resources, little known until now.
It contains oil, ore, and other minerals, as well as previously unknown living organisms that may be key to the development of cancer drugs, for example.
Sea floor larger than land
The coastal states are now competing intensively for new subsea areas.
They are enforcing their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coasts of a country.
Such a country has the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"In simpler terms, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and the layer below it that is the natural continuation of the subsea continental shelf.
The coastal maritime boundaries often extend beyond the 200 nautical miles of the exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Committee for the External Boundaries of the Continental Shelf should be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparatory work.
'One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three have succeeded", adds Mikulka.
The world has recently been struck by the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand won - its seabed area, as determined by the commission, was about a million square miles [1.6 million sq km], or six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
They hope that the future profits from the seabed will be priceless.
Other countries are also constantly submitting applications.
They may do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor, declared by the Convention to be the "common heritage of mankind", begins.
No country is exclusive here anymore.
The right to extract in this area is granted by the international body established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not the Klondike", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its territories are clearly defined legally and their regime is contractually fixed".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now part of the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc through the common organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
This organisation was granted the status of a "pioneer investor" in 1991, along with investors from a number of other countries, under the Convention.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea monkey is there, the Tatra is a kind of underwater replica.
"This total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be mined.
The area is rich in polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another Hindu jurist, Pakshi Rajan.
Another concrete example is given by Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division.
It's like a potato or, with a little imagination, a scroll with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More details are coming to light about the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
The rescue operation was carried out by the German special forces, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior.
According to the German Army, in addition to specialists from the GSG 9, the German Federal Police's flight training and the Federal Criminal Police Office, logistics experts from the German Technical Service were also present at the scene of the liberation.
According to a ministry spokesman late Monday, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage-takers let their captives escape, and then fled when they recognized signs of a violent rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to engage it as a field support force.
"Thankfully, this did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists, five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptians accompanying them, on September 19 in southern Egypt.
Following the abduction in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were taken to and from the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers remains unknown, as do the details of the release of the hostages and the payment of the ransom.
The survivors have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't give any details about the release.
So far, Berlin has not provided any information on when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily, the five tourists and the special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on an Airbus of the German Air Force.
The US House of Representatives is rejecting the rescue package.
The US House of Representatives has narrowly defeated a $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones has plummeted.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 against the government's bailout of the financial markets.
Despite calls from President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, the program failed to win a majority to stem the chaos in the financial markets.
The backers desperately tried to convince the critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney, a Democratic negotiator has called on the House to support the bill, even though it's unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
The Dow Jones, even as the vote was taking place, fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
Investors were worried that the government's bailout might fail.
The index rose just before the vote was over, only to fall again after the failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The program must be approved by both the House and the Senate before it can take effect.
The directors are getting more and more bookings.
It's a good winter for German tour operators.
One study found that the number of bookings for the coming months was up significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the study shows that the traveling spirit of Germans has not diminished.
The German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin that travel agencies had recorded a 31% increase in winter season bookings compared with the same period last year.
According to a study by the market research institute GfK, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
The October turnover of travel agencies was 11% higher than in October 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates to the total market.
The Institute took into account travel bookings up to the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate has led to a particularly high demand for travel to the USA, the DRV said.
The rate of bookings here has gone up by a third.
The Germans also particularly like to visit Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their home countries.
The most sought after were the organised routes, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Because of the rising cost of energy and food, the cost of package tours is "more predictable to the passengers than for individual package tours".
Passengers can save money by, among other things, using pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so that again a growth in traffic compared to the previous year can be expected - although according to another study, fewer German tourists travelled compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
The endlessly repeated ballermann hits, the gallon-liters of beer and the celebrities wearing the dirndl.
Debut with the Wiesen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, a TV presenter, and she wears a tailored thong.
My hair is dark, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes at the store.
But we have one thing in common: We're only three minutes into the Wiesnen, and the photographers are already rushing up to us and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to the Wiesnen.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndl is doing the trick.
As a Wiesn tourist trained in white sausage north of the equator, my comfort level is still limited by the folk costume.
But when he arrived at Theresienwiese, it wasn't so bad.
Almost everyone is wearing thongs or leather pants; no one is looking itchy or awkward - everything is perfectly fine.
The only strange looks at the chocolate banana stand are my D'Urdeli apron.
A woman in Munich calls my attention to the fact that I tied the veil wrong: "Bound on the left, you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are a widow, in the back you are a widow".
I secretly tied the mast from the back to the left.
"That's it", he says, and laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirting techniques and wear simple "I'm too drunk to dress" lapels and uninvitedly show their naked buttocks.
The young man with the exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he too is visiting Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very fantastic, with a long "aaaaa".
All this after he tells me how he got rid of the contents of his previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of those fire hoses that everyone thinks is a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of the infamous "forbidden urinators".
Others are not so fortunate to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics swarm the area, tending to the poor wretches.
The nurses always show up in groups - four of them carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: arriving empty, leaving stuffed.
Who's lying in the liquor cabinet under the door?
"These are the ones who are completely ready", one of the nurses replied to my question, and then in the middle of the film.
Police have named the victim of the accident
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died at a hospital.
Brentwood resident Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road was in a car accident on Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving after the crash.
He's been released on bail since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon is a reality
Long before Turkey's intention to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deeply into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 paces from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with a tower at each outer corner, and looks like some kind of German country town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little rusty.
However, a look inside the vaulted ticket office reveals the extent of the business that was going on in the westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquest, wanted to use this railroad from Damascus to Baghdad to what is now Saudi Arabia to achieve its ambitions to conquer the Middle East.
German efforts to conquer the world collapsed during World War I.
His railroad was attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded, destroying the building's beautifully crafted roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into ruin, and it is well past history.
At the same time, today, as the railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves - at least in a symbolic sense - as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new politics is the metal of commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to gauge the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Suat Kiniklıoglu, a member of the Turkish parliament.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour blackout that set the tone for the famous documentary film about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, a new city that was meant to be a symbol of the new secular state that was turning its back on the past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building built specifically for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburban area, between shopping malls and semi-finished coffee houses, where middle-managers in suits - men and women alike - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kinyiklioglu would have been a politician of the center-right in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit and tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy aims to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order", he said.
Turkey is isolated from its rear.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He didn't have a choice.
It had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will have to make a choice?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to be put in the way".
He then emphasised what almost everyone I spoke to here has said, almost in a roundabout way: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are as much to the advantage of Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey's own advantage.
It was as if they were trying to convey the message that, figuratively speaking, all of Europe, including Turkey, could reach Asia and the Middle East by those railways going east.
When I was at the Hydarpasha station again, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conur, the two German gentlemen who had watched the construction of this magnificent structure 100 years ago.
How surprised you would be to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting in the harbor for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that back then, Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
At least at the time, there was no question as to which continent would claim this exciting land.
Memoirs of the lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962 as Guildford's music director, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necologist, Sept. 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, he founded the wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
Originally, the choir was for those under 21, but when the Proteus sang their final show in 1979 - many of us in our late 20's - we simply refused to be part of the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shapeshifter) was in keeping with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any note they put in front of them - be it a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or with a big orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often awe-inspiring and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration for our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He always said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the receipt.
So sing it!"
His technique of carmesan was always perfectly understandable and precise, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter what the music was, he always took it up.
John Frayn Turner wrote of him:
If ever there was a ringleader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he spent conducting the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the last 40 years, I've written reviews of over 100 of his concerts, but never one that disappointed, and often one that made me laugh.
Tod Handley had a combination of greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply "calloped the world with one or two well-known battleships".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25), "he went on to study economic history at Oxford in 1946 and was awarded a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while continuing to prepare for his bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees".
This is from the author's notes on Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime, under the supervision of Professor J. D. Chambers, completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, which was published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51 he was in the USA on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no telling why Woodruff would have embellished this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino on the Sage
"I recommend the exhibition 'Flamenco and the Life of J. Vicente Resino' because his black and white documentary style photographs are fascinating.
I was struck by the simplicity and strength of the photographs and the respect they showed for the people in them.
This exhibition is all about emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
For the second time in a row, Honda's sales record is
In November, Honda will begin the distribution of the second generation Jazz.
True, the predecessor had a large enough passenger space, but the new model's interior design is even more spacious.
This is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and fuel-saving.
It was evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor in appearance, many internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we get into the details of the new model, we should tell you that the new Jazz was launched six years after the first generation was launched.
So first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz may be less known in Europe, but it's breaking sales records in other markets.
In Japan, for example, the Jazz was the top selling car brand in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million copies of Jazz have been sold since its release.
The second market was the Old Continent, with almost half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda is looking to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz cars, and by 2009 it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
On the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz, representing 6,7% of Honda's total Spanish sales.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2000 units in a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's Spanish sales.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 units sold by the end of this year, 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decline of 16 percent.
Despite the conditions of the sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1,8% from 1,6% last year.
I would like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
It would be the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid with a length of 4,370 millimeters, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's market share would be held by the United States, with the remaining share shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is more spacious in every way.
It is 3,900 millimetres (five centimetres) longer, 1,690 millimetres (two centimetres) wider and has a wheelbase of five centimetres, or 2,500 millimetres.
His height, however, remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the size, the passenger compartment is also wider.
The larger interior space is guaranteed by the new bodywork and the central fuel tank - a solution already known from the previous Jazz.
The total capacity of the so-called double-deck cargo holds has also increased, to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
However, it is appropriate to note that the dimensions referred to are those of the 1.4 engine type, as the 1.2-litre Honda Jazz has a 379 litre boot.
Some exterior modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear taillights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier accessibility to the rear seats.
In addition, the rear doors have been raised to 80 degrees from the 67 degrees of the front Jazz.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new, too.
At the start of its production, this small model was available with two, 1.2- and 1.4-litre engines.
The i-VTEC technology provides both fuel consumption and CO2 savings compared to its predecessor, as well as improved mechanical tuning and excellent all-round performance.
The 1.2 litre engine produces 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and has a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine, which in the previous Jazz had 78 horsepower, consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now produces 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision-avoidance 'snow'
For the development of its accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has drawn inspiration from nature, specifically from the world of bees, for its new invention.
A Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the flight of bees and avoids accidents.
It may be that the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step in the development of collision-avoidance technologies.
Engineers from the Advanced Technology Center of Nissan Motor Co. in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan, built this little robot.
As defined by Kazuhiro Doi, the Brand Director of Technology PR and Research and Development, the BR23C represents a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety cover.
The robot will enhance the company's ability to avoid collisions.
As they fly, each bee forms an oval-shaped personal space, very similar to a Nissan safety helmet.
But even more important is the bee's complex eye, which sees in all directions at more than 300 degrees, allowing it to fly unobstructed in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of the compound eye, engineers designed a device called a laser range finder.
The instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres in front of BR23C at 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts into a collision avoidance operation.
"Once the obstacle is detected, the little robot imitates the movement of the bee and immediately changes direction by shifting the wheels at a greater or lesser angle to avoid the collision.
The system is most distinguished from the currently available instruments by the fact that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre is carried out completely automatically.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the bypass manoeuvre cannot be directed up or down, nor across, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and manner as in the case of bees.
That's why Nissan has added a rotation function to the robot to avoid collisions, in addition to acceleration and deceleration.
"This machine only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
It doesn't need to store data, and it doesn't need intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can run without interruption with just a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabytes, but we're not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of technology for the immediate prevention of collisions, which Nissan estimates could be introduced in series production cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may also be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to help the car reach its destination by avoiding obstacles in the road.
Fear of a Mortgage
We have to admit that the US Treasury Department, besides having a lot of investable cash, is not without common sense.
With the recession looming, and to keep Americans from becoming stranded with the vagaries of questionable credit-rating mortgage banks, they created an entertaining and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Ross Loans Hotel" ... or the "Ross Loans Hotel" ... or the "Ross Loans Hotel" ... or the "Ross Loans Hotel".
The depiction of the housing and especially the reception grief suggests that we think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really time to borrow money.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because that's probably the whole point of it.
The information on the website is indeed useful but is not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the general public.
But what if we were to add to the game?
For example, the hotel could be the room of our dreams.
It's actually something, because we don't even dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley is opening up its capital to MUFG.
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will buy a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, for $9 billion for 21% of the company's shares after Morgan Stanley's stock price plunged sharply.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The price accepted is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on August 31.
MUFG invests an additional USD 6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide a return of 10% and a conversion rate of USD 31,25.
Morgan Stanley said that the average exchange rate for the global transaction would be $29 which is 28% above the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell 6.79% at 5pm GMT and closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company", explains John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley last week approved a new status that allows it to diversify its activities, but it's also coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reinforces the fact that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the Wall Street giants.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for approximately $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago that the holding would be made up entirely of ordinary shares", explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and protect against potential risks".
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
The transaction will result in a decrease in earnings per share of approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG could convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year if the latter's trading volume over a given period exceeded the exchange rate by more than 50%, i.e. by around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that the funds from MUFG will enable it to exploit its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, a spokesman for the group did not provide precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the acquisition of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier 1 solvency ratio by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet had improved "definitely" since late August.
The past few weeks have been very trying for the group, as its share price has fallen by half, while the cost of its default risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
Of the big investment banks, there is only one survivor after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, and that is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced that it has received $15 billion, some of it from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
This is Rafael Correa's statement from Quito on Monday.
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his colleagues and friends, Correa on Sunday outlined his vision for the new constitution.
It has succeeded in its mission, with 64% of voters voting in favour of the referendum, according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to the poll, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, and 0.7% of the votes were cast in blank ballots.
The draft constitution required 50% plus 1 votes to pass.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a civil society organization showed a huge "yes" vote of 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, has already spoken of the victory of his draft constitution in the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won a resounding victory", he declared, and thanked the Ecuadorians at his governor's residence in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As you know, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
The OAS observation mission reported that the vote was held in a calm atmosphere, with the main topic being a 444-point text that summarized the principles of the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, while retaining the right of the state to "plan development" for a country that basically lives off oil production by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by expatriates.
Correa's constitutional draft, which was voted in 2006, also reinforces the power of the head of state, who can only serve two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to take advantage of this opportunity and will run for president again in February 2009.
The constitution also includes free health care and free education, which the president has already begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, half of whom live below the poverty line.
Finally, the constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the Quito-Washington agreement on the use of an Ecuadorian facility as a base for US counter-narcotics measures.
The 19 hostages in Chad have been freed
Egyptian commandos have been on the loose after the kidnappers took 11 tourists and their eight companions hostage for 10 days.
The hostages are in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held captive in the desert for ten days before being safely transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed in Chad this morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at around 4:30 p.m. at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately taken to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area on the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "in good health" and the kidnappers "have not been ransomed", said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were part of an off-road safari, after which the group was dragged from hiding place to hiding place by 35 unknown hostages.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, which organises the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that a 30-strong special commando team arrived in two helicopters at the scene, where they attacked the hostage takers just before dawn.
"The two groups engaged in a firefight, killing half the kidnappers and allowing the rest to escape", said the leader, who asked not to be named.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces from the Egyptian Light Brigade were sent to the Sudan, where they were joined by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian diplomatic chief, Franco Frattini, who was in Belgrade, stressed the role of the Italian secret agents and special operations teams.
"We must acknowledge that this outcome could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence and action teams", he said, without giving further details.
He also denied that ransom was paid for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during a patrol, they had intercepted a truck carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two others.
In the meantime, he has been involved in the recruitment of the Taliban fighters in Darfur.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
The debate on the funding of culture is now at the centre of the news and the current election campaign.
We should be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will speak up to expose the ridiculous amounts of money that are being spent on starving little museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historic sites?
What politician would dare to remind the federal government that it doesn't care about its monuments and heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that actually ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros just on restoring the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
And the constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by every citizen, every elected official and every governmental agency in concert.
The Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec) is a federation of 211 societies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archiving and genealogy. More than 40 000 volunteers work on historical research and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological findings, with a minimal budget.
Often these organizations are protecting our heritage tooth and nail, and protesting with the last breath of their life as developers and policy makers turn their bulldozers against our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis Bank nationalised by the Benelux governments
The Benelux countries are helping to partially nationalise the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which was the first European bank to fall into difficulty as a result of the US credit crisis. The three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support to a financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments reached agreement on the matter at the end of the week at the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis to hit the waves in the context of the international financial crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in its case can therefore be considered precedent-setting in some respects.
The decision, which was made on Sunday night, will see all three states buy up nearly half (49%) of the bank's existing assets there.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, including in particular the activities, mainly insurance, acquired from the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' stock began to plunge last week, and the second half of the week was marked by a serious crisis at the institute.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to be allowed to fail.
The company's stock just dropped about 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock has dropped by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but the company's managers consider this to be unrealistic.
The company's management blamed the collapse of Fortis shares on overseas market uncertainties related to the adoption of a $700 billion U.S. package.
The stock was up a little bit Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to head the bank in the person of Filip Dierckx.
The bank has been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
There's no panic among the bank's customers, no raids on the drawers.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with an applicant based on people's drug purchase records.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program that makes the use of prescription data in all cases subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in independent hands, or we're leaving the chicken-killing to the fox", says Richard Dicket, who developed a program to track prescriptions for drugs, according to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies may determine the amount of the premium and the amount of the indemnity if the health of the customer is concerned, and if the risk is considered too great, they may not take out insurance.
In the past, a person was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the examination was completed.
Dick had a much cheaper system ten years ago: he could easily obtain from pharmacies the ID number of a customer, the medications that the customer had purchased in the past year and a half, and from this program he could infer what disease he had and what his medical condition was.
For example, if you are taking high-dose cholesterol-lowering drugs on a regular basis, it indicates that you have practically untreatable high blood-fat levels, which immediately places you in a higher risk category.
There are several variants of the program, some of which also include a risk factor, so that the insurer has little to do other than the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include the fact that some drugs can be used for more than one purpose, such as certain compounds that can be used to treat migraines or hot flashes, but also to treat depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former not.
Companies have been set up to collect and process the data, and they ask for the patient's consent before they collect the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now required to do so by the authorities, although no penalty has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies are now processing lab tests and linking them to drug data to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health.
As more companies gain access to data, it becomes increasingly difficult to control its use.
There's a separate health data protection law, but it only covers health care providers and insurance companies.
Congress is considering a bill that would give the government control over companies that specialize in data.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he develops his program, which would link the transfer of data to the express consent of the data subject.
It is another matter that the person concerned cannot possibly refuse to pay the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not sign a contract with him.
So the roosters are, to some extent, still at the mercy of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
Trade between the EU and India doubles
As the EU and India are each other's leading trading partners, this theme dominated the agenda of the ninth Summit, alongside other, largely global issues.
There's a French-Indian summit today, where the main topic will be nuclear cooperation.
The European Union, while recognising that India is a rising democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, has not yet reached a common ground on whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not raised at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The European Council, meeting in Brussels on 14 and 15 June, welcomed the European Union's new political partners, the European Union and the United States, and the European Union's new leaders.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
The Commission has also taken the initiative to establish a common framework for the development of the air transport sector in the Union.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the reconciliation.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global affairs.
The European Parliament and the Council also adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East and the peace process in the region.
They also pushed for the end of the Doha round, although both of them have a lot to do with the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the world at the climate conference next year, to make a global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising, and they have called for an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is going to the French capital today where he is going to hold a bilateral meeting on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
In Paris, they are hoping to give French companies a contract worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to news reports, the deal is for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are strongly represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair will host 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, spread over 171,790 square meters of floor space, and more than 403,000 books.
The Italian Government is represented at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion by Francesco Maria Giro, Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square metres, through the construction of a single Italia Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, which will provide an opportunity to present data, trends and perspectives on the situation of Italian book publishing.
The data show a steady decline in the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market, especially in the field of adult and youth literature.
The plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The remains of the plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared on September 3, 2007 over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the California-Nevada border.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
"After determining the position of the plane, we have dispatched a team and we can now be certain that this is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance", said Madera County Sheriff John Anderson at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage, a board of inquiry was called in to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8 cab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, the same day that Fossett was on a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Also yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal effects near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was called off a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set numerous peaks that have made him a part of history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he was the first to fly around the world in a balloon, a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he also flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes, at an altitude of 50,000 feet [15,445 m], which he made with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking commercial
An unusual, yet original and distinctly shaped hobbit craft with large surfaces and cleared corners.
These are the words of the latest Mercedes-Benz "compact SUV", with which the German automaker has tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely for this reason that the unconventional content of the SUV GLK's launch campaign, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign for the new vehicle uses a previously unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters, which have never been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster campaign, which consists of three phases, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of media communication will begin with a spatial presentation of the car, in which the new SUV will be seen in near-real dimensions and in three-dimensional form, using special glasses distributed around Corso Como.
The viewer will have the feeling that the car is standing out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK is revealed in detail and then assembled into a single image.
There's no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the automotive advertising world with this promotion.
Will this be enough to interest potential customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Young people from Triveneto, probably excluded from the race.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of, members of a group called "Ultras Italia", who have been following the national team for years and who, to tell the truth, have never caused much trouble.
Never been in a fight with the opposing team's fans.
The nucleus of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
As well as Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller, sporadic groups (actually only a few units) from Campania and Puglia.
Italian flags were flown with the home town of the supporters on them: on Saturday they were taken down so that they could not be identified.
They're following the example of the English cheerleaders.
In Bulgaria, they were faced with a real Nazi fanatic group, the Drucks of Levski.
The Italian Football Federation issued 144 tickets to Italian fans, which were name tickets, so it was easier to control the fan base.
The Ministry of Interior checked everyone: there was no one among the students in Sofia who was being prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related priors have been denied tickets and travel.
The Ministry of Interior is currently waiting for the Sofia police to send the necessary documents, and then will take the necessary measures: fans who are arrested or identified during the riots can be punished with a five-year ban.
It is an international ban, not only on Italian stadiums, but on all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't get their feet on any football pitch.
Thank God for that.
But we also have to fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that this group of only 150 will be joined by others.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and those who behave in this manner must not be excused", the Ministry of the Interior said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially since we're approaching Wednesday's national team match in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Watchdog meets, and Tuesday, the Sports Events Safety Review Board, which may include a division of the Homeland Security, covert services that deal with cheerleading behavior.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arms under the Italian anthem is not a crime in Bulgaria"...
This idea was put forward, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who a few weeks ago was appointed to head the observation service of the Ministry of the Interior (a post previously held by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italia group has operated since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria it's not illegal to have a Duke, but even that 150 or 200 fans behaved shamefully.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person in the observation service, but crimes should be tried in the country where they are committed.
So far, this group hasn't caused any problems, so we need to investigate exactly what happened and consider what to do next.
But let's talk about the Italian anthem. It's not a crime, but if I may say so, it's not polite either.
