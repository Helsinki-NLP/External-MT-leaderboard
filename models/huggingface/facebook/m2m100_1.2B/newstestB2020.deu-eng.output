Fire in French chemical plant
The fire at a dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was by the Prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out in the night of Thursday. No one was injured in the incident.
The fire could be stopped.
People were urged not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are being manufactured at the chemical plant on the shore of the Seine. The factory is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett’s Lubrizol company and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which imposes strict safety requirements.
About 400 people work at the factory. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past – for example, when in 2013 through a leak the gas methantiol escaped and the surroundings smelled far from rotting eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman Announces Her Job To Look For Her Missing Dog for 57 Days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job.The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they then returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
The dog was panicking.
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog.But days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
“The tears flow”
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched for the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People stopped in their cars, climbed out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Bundeswehr losses: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. Among them are also three machine guns. The remainder is unclear in most cases.
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and 20,000 shots of ammunition.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapon and 3474 shots of ammunition have so far reappeared. Among the weapons and pieces of weapon still missing are, among other things, six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 guns, four G36 guns, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
The scale of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "terrible," said the left-wing Bundestag member Martina Renner. This was even more true since little was found during the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "dirty balance sheet." Renner criticized that the list did not identify whether the missing ammunition also included the one found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "and this despite a Franco supporter of A. being recently convicted for possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker Stena Impero leaves Iranian port
More than two months after its confirmation by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it first remained in Iranian waters.
The Stena Impero was launched on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Sea Route of Hormuz, accused of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to the UK.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified tremendously in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel praises people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people in the DDR who walked out on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution.In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had swung the then DDR regime, Merkel said at a feast of the Thuringia CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt.
Musk seeks extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record, but despite the delivery boom, the electric car group has recently lost.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could deliver 11,000 orders, Musk said in his letter.The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with a rise of more than six percent.The price has not risen so strongly for four months.In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and upcoming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Mystery Solved: That's why we can't chew ourselves
This was discovered by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they on Thursday evening.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approximation of a cuddling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch.This lies in a deep layer in the large brain, which already triggers laughter in anticipation of the cuddling.
According to the report, previous research showed that rats respond with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are ticked by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the large cortex of the brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed while self-touching
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - so that people can't cuddle themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the large cortex of the brain are suppressed during a self-touching. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the alien touch and cuddling by the scientists, but the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh has been enhanced.
But if the self-touching and the touching by others occurred at the same time, laughter was also suppressed.This suggested that the rat’s brain could not distinguish between the self-touching and the touching by others.The new findings suggested that people can’t cuddle themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to cuddle themselves. In this experiment, they sometimes broke this initiation prematurely, showing escape behavior or fearlessness. This ambivalence is the same as the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of cuddling is a behavioral response that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe avoided: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire at a dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Prefecture of Normandy told AFP on Friday.
According to authorities, no health-threatening substances appeared.The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.No one was injured in the incident.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett
The plant is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett’s Lubrizol company and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which imposes strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past – for example, when in 2013 through a leak the gas methantiol escaped and the surrounding area smelled wretched eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the abolition of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU if Brussels does not comply with his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
About Cox, who had advocated Britain’s stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunify this country would be to carry out the EU exit.”
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya, which killed 77 people, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The "Iron Roses" (German: the Iron Roses) monument consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks following the attacks at the Oslo Cathedral.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be revealed - the roses were crafted by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then on the island of Utöya killed dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate brought no solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran was able to get into the sea again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, has returned to international waters.After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, shipping company Stena Bulk said.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now headed to Dubai for medical examinations, among others, said ship's chief Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship had left Iranian waters.
“This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas.We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,” it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested the tanker on July 19 on charges of violating the laws of the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and pressing situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that there was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar: there, in early July, a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, was placed on the chain. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions that it was an exchange deal to release the "Stena Impero" London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the ocean. The tensions in the region have been tremendously exacerbated over the past few months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
The tensions between Tehran and Washington are due to the nuclear dispute between the two countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies this. The United States alone withdrew from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter and expanded agreement. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would be predestined to be a “war winner.” In view of the tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to relocate. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering relocating their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This is not just about the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young labor and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created to play a more significant role in the global wide-ranging production chain.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus.From Haudegen in the White House depreciatingly titled as the “Kingdom of Customs,” America has withdrawn the emerging country’s trade preferences for 2,000 products at the beginning of June.The United States accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India is merely a side-scenario. In addition, America looks at the world’s largest democracy through its security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, a salve of U.S. penalties against India appears unlikely.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a heavy standing in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reformist is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-national state for too long. Companies now receive building permits faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more stringent insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for the more rapid liquidation of seemingly dead companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, much has turned for the better in India in the first five years of the Mode. But in trade policy this is not the case. Encouraged by the protection of internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the National Conservative government even set up new barriers.
In the West, Modi hangs on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who is radically renewing his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But at its core, the "India First" lawyer never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the tribal voters of the Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and oppress this short-sighted policy.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week, according to a report.The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency, citing the family of Chirac. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday at the Paris Invalidendom, media.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics World Cup
The world championship had long been in the goal, when heart-warming scenes took place in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Aruba’s Jonathan Busby began to swing dangerously. He could hardly stand on his feet well 300 meters before the goal, ran in an unhealthy posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hit him and supported him to the goal for the last half of the stadium round. But the forces were still enough for both to stop the accompanying wristwatch after the finish.
“I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same,” Dabo said after the Mixed Zone race, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the journalists gathered. Shy first, he didn’t want to talk about his heroic deed at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances he’t have even started. “That’s why I’m proud to run here for my country,” he said.
He did so that evening with emphasis – and much more intensely than he might have thought. Because this heroic deed will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place – by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this advance. It nothing at the end, because Busby, who only came to the goal with much help, was disqualified in the end by the World Athletics Federation.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, took part to set up a personal best-time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this managed with 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already."
Millions: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been tightened ahead of possible government-critical protests.In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday.Some metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, police have stepped up road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They targeted the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Spanish-exiled Egyptian construction entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who rolled out the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" for today's Friday at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "people's revolution". The man is also not "good for most young Egyptians, because as an entrepreneur for the army he fled millions, but his embassies are coming.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) more than 1,570 arrests by Friday, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary Arrests
According to their lawyers, the accusations against the detainees range from “spreading false information” to membership in a “terrorist association”.In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces interrogated and searched in uniforms, but also in civilian clothes, according to HRW, also arbitrarily passers.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies cannot be exempted from the VAT on donations, the ministry said on a question from the Greens Bundestag group, which was by the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that federal citizens send back every sixth package when they order on the Internet.About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage.To donate them would cost the companies extra money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate material donations as a turnover, which is then taxed.
Greens leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear by a decree that companies can evaluate non-selling products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations.
Banksy Art to Auction: There Was Never A Better Time to Sell This Painting
Banksy’s famous work “Devolved Parliament” is due to be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work emphasizes "the re-formation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes".From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on October 3.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the Southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. That year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a tough blow-out with the opposition on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after the Supreme Court lifted a forced break imposed by Johnson.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in southeastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a mitch. The work is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament, according to his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said at a book show on Friday.
Johnson has harshly assaulted Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "trait" to the people. Accusations that he could put the MPs at risk because they could be the target of murder threats, for example, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore calm is if MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU.It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Calls for UN Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first speech before the UN General Assembly, again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. "If things go bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China.
Not even a bottle of water.
Demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government is responding with a tough hand. It shoots sharp ammunition at the population, over 2,000 detainees join in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners already serving there. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being drowned by their own government have driven millions out into the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi can’t handle, no matter how hard it goes against opponents.
Today every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever a large part of the population has trouble getting a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks in the terminal: BER chief: no more "showstopper" for the capital airport
Two months have been spent checking whether the complex set of systems in BER fire protection works together.The operators are satisfied with the process.But the tube is not finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said there are still shortcomings to be worked out in the terminal. "We have many detailed issues, but we do not have a real showstopper."
However, there are indications that the time-reserve is no longer likely to be too large.The announcement of completion is now to be submitted to the Construction Office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this fall.
Hundreds of defects on power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operation here, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the remediation of the defects," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release yet for all the buckets on which the cable lines hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the train station under the terminal is still not working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke cuts that shut down in the event of a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years.It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011.The cost has increased from two billion since construction began in 2006 to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsibilities plan to expand the airport, which will be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by Chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said.
Chemnitz: Drugs machines exploded - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines in the chemnitz city area for it!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking license automates detonated in Chemnitz and the region has increased dramatically.
Police arrested a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz at the end of May.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik said: "In the course of the investigation for the induction of explosive explosions in the police unit with a severe case of theft, which were conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman said: “He apparently financed his dependence on narcotics with the prey.”The bomber had exploded parking machines on the Bürgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage is at least 60,000 euros.
The suspect is now in custody and the police investigation against him continues.
It is believed that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA to take over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa’s subsidiary AUA is taking over “the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna,” a Austrian Airlines spokesman confirmed to the APA on Friday.
The de facto dismantling of the Lufthansa Eurowings airline’s Vienna base will result in four of the seven Eurowings aircraft currently operating in Vienna, which will be taken over by AUA as a “Wetlease” from January 2020, including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter planes to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA turnaround and network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times are to be aligned with connection flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the turnaround Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a “production company” for the sister group AUA. Barcelona and Rome would be served, among other things, with AUA flight numbers, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The boarding product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight crew are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight numbers are according to the report no longer served in Terminal 1, but just like the AUA in Terminal 3.
Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it will increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also known as the "Wetlease", which the trade union criticized as a circumvention to the collective contract.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary’s warning that Lauda will have surpassed AUA in five years responded on Friday to AUA board Andreas Otto: “We remain number one on site, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries.
Wonderful news from the British royals: During the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped by the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
“We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to be actually married,” the couple, who has been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, said in the official statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that will help us a lot in the years to come full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie Cut the Pictures
The official wedding photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also posted on her Instagram account.
A royal party
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. Details about the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar big celebration as Eugenie’s wedding on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet – there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genes of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Switzerland scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday.The Kühne Foundation funds the project with 12.5 million euros.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete gene of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes have known possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic.
The goal of the five-year project, according to the initiators, is to develop new options for prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other popular diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos so far primarily deals with allergies. Now there should be a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professorship for bioinformatics. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been open-hearted in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biological samples of the healthy participants came from Hamburgers, who also participated in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is, according to the clinic, the largest local health study in the world. In the genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to protecting the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zürich.
According to the UKE, a person’s genome can now be decoded within 24 hours. The net material cost for this is 1300 euros. The world’s first gene sequencing, whose results were published in 2001, has still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on October 1st, as early as the end of 2020, all 9000 samples are to be analyzed.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school.According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the victims still underage, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur’an and being “improved.”In fact, the protectors were held by their teachers under “most degrading and inhumane conditions,” Sabo said.About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Koran school was to have existed for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents were shocked when they were told about the conditions at the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient government facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Aid Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Nigerian Police Release 400 Children from School
"Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school.The conditions there were "inhumanly worthy."The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves at their school and held in chains.Some were sexually abused.TV footage showed depleted and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World Cup: More accusations against Messi and Klopp
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After the captain of Nicaragua declared he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to the FIFA.
In recent years, many things at FIFA have proved to be outrageous: the World Cup surrender, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials.The FIFA World Soccer Election has not been suspected so far of being unclean – if one avoids the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote by sympathy rather than by objective assessment.
But after the captain of Nicaragua complained that he hadn’t voted at all, further discrepancies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account.
The FIFA apologizes for the fact that “the signatures on the ballot forms were given in large letters and therefore not valid.”
South Korean coach surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation says that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was eventually estimated: with Lionel Messi at first place, Virgil van Dijk at two and Sadio Mané at three.
Juan Barrera, the captain of Nicaragua, said: “I didn’t vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is false, thank you,” he wrote.
The election documents were filled "in error" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan national team, said in a statement of the association. But the second captain, Manuel Rosas, actually voted. "We take responsibility for the administrative mistake," it said in the message. But both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is on the official FIFA list."
The other cases are now examined by the FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said U.S. Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be established." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far held back on criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, but few have shown discomfort because of it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party.
As another high-ranking Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker also spoke in favour of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have not formally participated in the trial against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore primarily symbolic. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also criticized the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second house of parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". U.S. media also reports that the first cracks appeared among the Republicans internally.
The affair could result in the initiation of a removal proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the removal procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impeachment. But the decision about an actual removal fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no U.S. president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were Tortureers on Board of the Racket "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily on suspicion of raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete, 31, was arrested in June after she illegally sailed the port of Lampedusa with the "Sea Watch 3" rescue ship and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with Sea-Watch 3. The suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their torters in Italy. "We cannot rule out this, but we do not even have secure information about it," said Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer to the German news agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can’t know exactly who comes onto the ships. “We can’t scan who the people are. They come without passports,” said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya.
Former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for record delivery at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could deliver 110,000 orders, Musk said in his letter.The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a rise of more than six percent.The price has not increased so strongly for four months.In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and upcoming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: only a bridge financing again
The U.S. Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year starting on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a continuing financing (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown at midnight on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration.
Shutdown avoided
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities in time.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority.The spending laws, however, reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate.
In the Senate, Republicans appear to be trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. Democrats are interfering with the wall plans and its funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The walls divide the ghosts.
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November.
Given the ongoing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity.Proposal S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically keep the federal administration’s funding at the previous year’s level, blocking parliamentarians’ travel activities and holding back their wages until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a “chance” for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband prohibited
With a small majority, the National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment that should give widows access to the sperm of their deceased husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advance in Paris argued that a child so conceived then bears a "particularly severe fate".
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, voted in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may in the future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with the sperm of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only to heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is nevertheless often difficult.
Climate compensation: Calls for flight fees for Unis become louder
There is a lot of flight at universities, which is why the country wants to pay a climate tax there too in the future. The rectors say they don’t have money for it.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate over a climate tax on university and university flights, which was postponed before the summer break, is coming back in motion. After the National Directorate Conference responded skeptically to a corresponding push from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, graduate students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and one Educational College are pleading for compensation for service flights. This is a first step "urgently necessary", while there must be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on the ice, because the CDU has still not approved the proposal of the Greens.
Russia arrested North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. At that time there was a shooting between border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters.
30,000 fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and seized on the boats, and three fisherman boats and two motor boats were seized and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after lawsuits from local businessmen, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily detained there this year, according to media.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East Primorje region, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained about the high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. These were also used to extract small living creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where it took 200 years to break down.
In the future, there will be only 18,000: the U.S. lowers the asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The wealthiest country in the world is shrinking against asylum seekers: as confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the ceiling for the legal flow of refugees will be further reduced.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again.In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department said.In the now almost-expired economic year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the readiness for asylum seekers from around the world in recent years.
The increased ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980.The State Department described the U.S. as “the most merciful and generous nation in history,” a formulation strongly reminiscent of the language used by the current U.S. president.
A "responsible treatment" of refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their homelands to help reconstruct, Trump said. for his tough course in migration policy he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a time link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a potentially threatening removal process.
In the future, the U.S. government will focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the statement of the State Department.
The United States wants to that in particular people from this “northern triangle” of Central America apply for asylum in other countries.In this context, the United States has signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders orangutan to be released from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a human monkey recovery station in the United States at the request of the Argentine judicial authorities. The "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so their release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight - not as a passenger but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilograms-weight human elf is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is expected to live in the future at the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pets of pop star Michael Jackson. But before entering Florida, "Sandra" has to go through a quarantine of about 40 days at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995.The process for the basic rights of Sandra, which was initiated in 2014 by animal advocates, has helped transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education facility to preserve biodiversity will be established there.
Swiss extreme climbing record: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has managed a new hussar ride on the 3000 meters high Grande Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other tools, the Swiss overcame the 550-meter-high northern wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb.
Arnold now holds the record in free solo speed on four of the six most important northern walls in Europe.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The U.S. sportswear manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profits despite the trade conflict with China. The net profit increased in the previous quarter to $1.4 billion (nearly €1.3 billion). That is 25 percent more than in the previous period, as the group announced on Tuesday.
In the three-month period up to the end of August, sales increased to $10.7 billion, with Nike’s sales increasing by 22 percent in China, the largest in the world.The Beaverton group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People’s Republic from its approach to targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to push forward the sportswear manufacturer’s “digital transformation” with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage.
Stadium ban for life in Italy due to racism
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan. Brazil-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late on Thursday.He the fan’s account on Instagram and the police.In addition, the Roma supporter will never be allowed to visit a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans scandate racist insults against black players from rival teams. “We can’t have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that’s very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist singing at the Premier League match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them may no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club launched the investigation with an announcement last year.
The ultra-leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets, according to Italian media reports, they had "military control" of the ticket trade for the fankurve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political – years of age are covered with meaningful names. Look closer, the awards are full of contradictions.
"The crabs come!" was the call that officially launched the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on 21 September, which also marked the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runway of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". Gaunoch's great natural environment offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already begun to grow crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has evolved into a shaping industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as a technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers’ incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has carried out a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and carefully built the service network for "licensing under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending" thus the city aims to comprehensively optimize the environment for licensing, for services and for development.
Gaochun fully leverages the local benefits of connecting to south Jiangsu and southern Anhui, taking advantage of the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a landmark to settle here to establish intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as organic farming plants, leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-territorial tourism zone and tourist destinations of national importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaunochun landscape have been incorporated, the state of the buildings for citizen services and public services has been improved, the fields of tourism, tourism and energy development are looking forward to the future.
Iran-U.S. conflict: Rouhani talks about ending sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke after his return from the UN General Assembly of a alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions.The United States had anticipated an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran’s leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so there would be a meeting.
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and pressed for a meeting to take place. "And America says I will lift the sanctions," Rouani added.
However, this advance was not done in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized.Given the existing penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul: Nearly 200
After western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes in the shortest time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been 200 re-earthquakes, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been shut down for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmaregion outside Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million-mile metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year poorly constructed houses collapse – among other things murdered by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as renowned architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as refugees have long been built. It was only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the quake of Thursday was in the Marmaray Lake in front of the Silivri district and about seven kilometers deep, according to the Afad disaster protection agency.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that injury or damage had not been at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic. Students were taken out of their buildings in the Silivri district for safety reasons.
Istanbul is considered to be endangered by earthquakes. Under the Marmara Lake lies a section of the so-called North Atlantic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when the earthquake will occur is unclear.
Companies design emergency plans, individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary standing next to the front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth turns.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning for earthquake in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wavered. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday, a woman writes. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned over Twitter of an earthquake. He urged people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is indicated at 13:59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a surge, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4,0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, a earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shattered the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Lake west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines that Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning.It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "these could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster.
A few weeks ago there was an incident - the earthquake caused great concerns in Istanbul too.In Albania there was also a strong earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two broken documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible removal procedure, U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president raises important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt".
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet, flight redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was redirected.The toilet door was blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said according to U.S. media.
At an unplanned landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was eventually released from the narrow cabin.She had been trapped in it for about an hour, U.S. media, citing other passengers.
In a video published on the Internet, which is said to have come from Flight 1554 according to U.S. media, several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, Okay?" says one man. The airline has apologized to all passengers.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? he writes a book about it - and his protagonist is undeniable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation,” the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (originally: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now suddenly is the most powerful man in Britain.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like once the Soviet leaders, when brexiters in high-ranking positions are just causing the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must wonder what he can do.
First published in 1915, Kafka’s story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself “transformed into an enormous monster,” gradually being excluded from family and society and eventually dying.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will receive whistle brakes to reduce the noise exposure from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
This is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU agency, funding comes from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until October 31
German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until including October 31, 2019, a day after its insolvency application. trips “could not take place for insolvency reasons,” the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the wake of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday.The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance.
Based on the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resort will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, a Zurich spokesman for the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not now asked by these hotels to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise forced," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own data, had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot. Some were therefore forced to put more than 1000 euros on the table.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday’s data, 70,000 Thomas Cook package vacationers from Germany were still traveling. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the announced hotel payments by Zurich Insurance will only help travellers who are currently on the way.Thomas Cook customers who are just planning to fly on holiday will find it bad.Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips until including October 31 will be cancelled.This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As for travel with start from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. Basically, for these cases the Zurich insurance is also responsible. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana, and in Africa he is now walking straight in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry, wearing a blue protective vest, ignited and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set the circle of fire in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Though the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she went at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared mine field in 1997 had gone around the world.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear statement: with him there will be no guaranteed third postponement of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are of eternal duration with the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the blonde head. His suspension of parliament in order to carry out its Brexit course to the exit date was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by parliament obliged Johnson to result in an extension of bilateral talks until October 31. This, however, Johnson had categorically excluded again.
Boris Johnson says deal is still possible
But the pressure doesn’t seem to go past Johnson, too.In the meantime, during a visit to a hospital, he suggested that he would support extending the negotiations until the end of October in the event of a non-cleaning:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And the Brexit negotiators in Brussels are gradually running away from the time. The EU and the UK negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent a UK exit from the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October is currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British prime minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in effect. The opposition does not trust the prime minister’s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this connection, the U.S. Health Agency CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage so far. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the U.S.
Fear of new protests in Egypt rises
The construction entrepreneur and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution" in it. For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass protests with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo, there has already been an increased police presence. Several metro stations have remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square have been blocked. Already in recent days, the police have strengthened their street controls and have partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protests in Egypt for years. Security forces responded to the same. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested – just because they were “at the wrong place at the wrong time,” HRW, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo has blocked websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he overthrew democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs Returns from Greenland Expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things, by skipper Boris Herrmann, who brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented the effects of global warming in recent months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar scientist said. He has been waiting for years for the younger generation to speak. For decades, it has been known that the Earth is warming up.
“What is happening at sea is often happening under public exclusion,” Fuchs said. he and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the oceans.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us, for whom the survival of the oceans is at heart, Arved Fuchs is a great model," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for snacks
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: That seemed too much for two Japanese tourists.
"Such cases are damaging to Rome's reputation.We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of tour guides in Rome, said in a statement to the Romanian daily Il Messaggero.
The Japanese women ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. This, however, cannot be deducted from the bill. Even a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the host said.
U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, actually be faced with a removal procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their inquiry in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - the talk is weeks before a decision would fall.
The allegation of the whistleblower, who ultimately made the conversation public with his complaint for concerns about national security and the democracy of the United States, is monstrous: the president abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election.
The essence of this project can also be traced to the now-published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text.The July 25 phone call, however, is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which alongside Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public’s perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani’s travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. “We don’t interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we are entitled to do,” he says to the newspaper. You might think it’s inappropriate, but “there’s nothing illegal about it.” Giuliani wants investigations to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there’s hardly any basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and may prove helpful to my government.”
The lawyer and former mayor of New York appears to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s counter-candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia investigations in the US.
The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently prospective candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, as Ukraine envoy of the Obama administration, pushed for the dismissal of then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin in order to stop his investigation of the gas company, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden served.
When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was far from being the only Western partner to press for his dismissal.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social Media Down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are mostly affected. On the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been charging since about 15:30 a.m. again. Also Instagram issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Even Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disruption, though not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disruptions
It is not the first massive disruption this year.Already in March and July, the services were down for several hours.And like in the previous cases, users also this time primarily use Twitter to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica.They were traveling with a hoverboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed.They were lucky in the disaster - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter took to rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade
"At 9:30 we received the message that just before ten we were launching, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tube boat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists working there.
Attention: Never charge your smartphone wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently arrived on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from early July.
Higher temperature leads to acupuncture
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. This is, according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery heats to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless charging, the researchers, on the other hand, even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad, have always measured over 30 degrees. If the phone lies a little next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad also rises, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of the battery. Therefore, each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only compensates for capacity, but it also does not last so long overall. So the life span is shorter. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery replacement is always associated with high costs on modern smartphones, this may be a helpful tip.
Practically
The technology is extremely convenient:Simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and troubling steam. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transmission) is imposed a world standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions.
Everest Stau Photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
According to a Nepalese climber, he climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: from him comes a viral photo of mountain climbers standing on Mount Everest snake.
The picture of the mass rush triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and the highest peak of the world.
A problem for Purja could be the climbing of the 14th eight-thousand: At present, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called, among other things, bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to talk to China to enable it to climb.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday: "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four corpses were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants in Sri Lanka, and their killing is theoretically punishable by death.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was captured by Iran. This was announced by the naval agency Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had captured the British-flagged tanker on July 19 under the accusation of violating the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent economic committee of the House of Representatives wants to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. This is about the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question of why the British government did not want to jump financially on the company struggling to survive. “Our interest is in overseeing the company as well as overseeing external auditors,” said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the increased family risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion came researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to weigh heavier than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon cancer, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an email published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla will have to raise as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of trade with a rise of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value so far.
Musk needs records to his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and upcoming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Will the British government bypass Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hidden about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the legislation recently passed by the parliament against an unregulated Brexit.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson may attempt to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law.
Johnson said he is aiming for a treaty with the European Union: "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran is increasing uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over saving the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete action," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained in return the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States alone withdrew from the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with “maximum pressure” to change course in its aggressively regarded Middle East policy. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with harsher provisions and in the meantime is re-imposing tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran last responded with a re-increase in the treaty restricted uranium enrichment.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use the centrifuges installed in early September.
Per the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore have left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, Rouhani assumed, but there will still be further talks, which hopefully will bring a solution.
Rohani denies Iran's involvement in Saudi attacks
However, the mixed position has changed after an attack on a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen knew about the attack, but the US considered it a false confession.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence for this," Rouhani said, but European leaders could not have done so in talks with him during the UN general debate.Instead, they would have only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the U.S. administration’s far-reaching sanctions should first be lifted, Rohani called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe.The comet has previously succeeded in doing so.
What was initially just a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system.The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-hauled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - using a self-made 65-centimeter-diameter telescope.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object to be observed in our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get close insights into an alien solar system before it disappears at no sight.Prime observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as by the Canary Astrophysics Institute. "The comet's current speed is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is significantly higher than the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a statement.
According to the analysis, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system – and clearly of interstellar origin, as by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and classification of celestial bodies. In honour of its discoverer, the interstellar swing star, which was initially recorded under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was designated by it as 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been observed in the approach, so the researchers will have many months to explore. "The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, until October 2020, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in an initial study determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Canary Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar swing star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. “The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this suggests that their composition must be similar,” said IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new path for the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems.
The agency intends to station the three-part comet interceptor spacecraft by 2028 at a standby position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, according to ESA science director Günther Hasinger, either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing’s new Mega-Airport Daxing
Shortly before the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic, the first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers will be delivered annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s most recent prestigious project is also called “Sea Star” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four take-off and landing tracks, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automated air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to the center of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly said that Berlin could learn from Beijing.The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has been postponed so far.
New supersonic plane to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours in 2030
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is the dream of the British space agency UK Space Agency. A special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, is meant to make this flight possible for the 2030s. "This is the technology that could this," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closer with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its cessation in 2003 and took three to three-and-a-half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, in which all 109 passengers died. In the past year, American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US Space Agency NASA. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
“Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transportation,” Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 – which is five times faster than sound.
Upheaval in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous bidders in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible blurry posts in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower,” Trump told U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
This was regarded as an attempt to intimidate the publisher. The event was not actually public. Several U.S. media outlets distributed audio clips of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for a removal procedure against Trump. their allegations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence employee who raises severe charges against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have obtained information from several government officials that the U.S. president is “using the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election in his favor.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to conduct investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. These include previous of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine telephone: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact text of the conversation under the roof. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made. This was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose after the conversation was ordered by lawyers from the White House, but instead was stored in a specially protected system.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known.The New York Times that it was an employee of the CIA.
In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate.
How Trump spoke in New York about those who allegedly played the whistleblower information, but provoked outrage.The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded with concern and lamented that Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives have been running for months in various committees various investigations against Trump and his environment. faced with the accusations of Ukraine, the Democrats are now proceeding investigations with new vigour to launch a possible removal proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials in the security and foreign affairs fields, mostly working among Democratic but also Republican presidents, said in a statement released on Friday that they supported a Democratic-initiated investigation into a possible removal of office.
With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision about an actual removal fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been removed by an impeachment procedure.
VW operating board: jobs will be “slightly” reduced
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe.This concern drives the car manufacturer’s operating board.The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros.
The “future pact” negotiated between the company and the operating council in 2016 already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced at the automotive manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer needed.
As our newspaper now learned from business council circles, however, jobs in production, which were not actually available, are "slinkingly" reduced by another way - that is, by the official course.
The operating council has no way to force the re-occupation in these cases. Meanwhile, in many places there is a shortage of personnel, which is increasing the workforce, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle factories would be greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW it was only said: "An adjustment of employment volume is made as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects. This will also reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thereby competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "It is in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the U.S. and China that we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant."
For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year.Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be shortened by 1.1 hours.
20 hours .
In our region, the Wolfsburg main factory is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter factories manufacture components. In Wolfsburg, the thumb rule is that there must be built 800,000 cars annually in order for the factory to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the use in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles – due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems with the transition to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust testing process.
As production chairman Tostmann announced last year, a million cars will be rolled out of the band in Wolfsburg "in the future."This will make it possible to bundle the production of the Golf at the main plant - because the factory in Zwickau will deliver the production of the Golf by converting it into the site for the production of electric cars.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e-mobility, it is expected to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the moment.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, driven to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution.
Six alleged Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to jail sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had dragged young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitute.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were transported by Libyan smugglers on pipeline boats across the Mediterranean, but the dream of a better future did not come true. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various bordels to cover the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the imprisonment and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women into bordels during the trial. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women to work," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the judgment announcement.
The verdicts include commercial and gang-based smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, custody and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa group, the flight crew union Ufo has once again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union "will inform on October 14 about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group," said UFO tariff chairman Daniel Flohr on Friday.
At this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it determined that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the claims. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appealing against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed a petition with the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by a court, arguing that the trade union had not appointed a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
It was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and the advisory board have resigned, including the longtime trade union chief Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended a already begun upset about cabin staff strikes at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future and to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year by 2030, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visa are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimage trips or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the conservative kingdom hopes to earn more income from the tourism business.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of Saudi Arabia's most important oil plants in the east: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field.As a result, national oil production crashed drastically, raising oil prices.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a girlfriend farewell in Los Angeles, according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colourful costumes printed with bananas on Instagram, among others, and asked his followers, "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding."
The Biebers gave themselves the yes-word a year ago at a New York stand office.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic.The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin), police said.
The authorities had been searching for the aircraft since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. In the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable deforestation and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 known tree species in Europe. 265 of them do not exist on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent endangered. 66 are already at the highest level of threat and thus ahead of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "strongly endangered", "threatened by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberische and Wild Rosskastanie Threatened
In Germany, Eberische (Sorbus) are mostly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the Deutsche Presse Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
The wild common rose castagnons are considered “threatened” since 2017 and are ranked at level two on the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, alongside a fungus, is the Balkan mining moth. It has spread from Southeast Europe since the 1980s across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild rose castagnons (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies.
Mushrooms and mushrooms are also in danger.
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for butterflies, bushes and mosquitoes. More than one-fifth of butterflies and mosquitoes and half of all bush species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Butterflies such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many neglected and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake in Istanbul: 34 injured
Thirty-four people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey, with no casualties, dozens of people forced to leave their homes and 14 schools in Istanbul closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged since the earthquake the day before, there have been 200 re-earthquakes.The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million-mile metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Lake lies a section of the so-called North Atlantic Disorder, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was at the time in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul and the authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is crazy excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina."
Shakira said in a statement that she felt honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "Queens" were together on stage.
Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though viewers have dropped lately: this February, the show in the United States attracted the least viewers in more than a decade.
In the dispute over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear.
Kaepernick, then San Francisco 49ers quarterback, was kneeling at the national anthem in the 2016/17 season before the NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a move, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked most African American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been united since March 2017 and has no longer disputed an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook's Plague: Hotels Get Money From Insurance
Some banks are likely to be costly due to the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press release. There are risks of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. This is also affected by Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its edition of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would likely have to make total depreciations of up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to take depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 million and 825 million pounds.The amounts actually to be depreciated are likely to be at the top of the range, an expert told the newspaper.
How large the losses of the creditors will eventually be will be revealed after the bankruptcy proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not shed too much hope. For example, the about 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad condition. Most of the money can probably be extracted from the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete allegedly brought murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are believed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "we can't rule out this, but we don't have any secure information about it," Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told dpa news agency.
Other migrants have identified the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, tortured and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships.
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, crashing a ship of the Italian financial police.The three suspects are also believed to have arrived there.
U.S. warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a “declaration of trustworthiness”.
Berlin would first try to control the risks, for example, with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology consists not only of hardware:
This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It’s “very hard to imagine” that a government agency, “wherever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief continued.
He accuses Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told Handelsblatt.
The U.S. is presenting findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the U.S. position.
Chemical plant burns in northern France: schools shut down
During the night, residents hear explosions.A giant firewall illuminates the sky over a chemical factory in northern France.The fire has been extinguished after hours - but the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's pubs in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the prefecture said.The Ministry of Interior had urged citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke.There were no injured.Farmers and breeders were urged to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the Prefecture. There is still a risk of smell spreading after the extinction, according to the Prefecture on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the scene.
A giant black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which manufactures additives for oils.
The plant in Normandy, according to authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are monitored.In Seveso, Italy, near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV news station that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples, but a contamination of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out.
The fire broke out at 2:40 a.m. early in the morning, the authorities.The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: “Germany needs to invest now”
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to increase investment to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner, the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates to make the necessary decisions.”
Actions would need to be taken by those countries that have budgetary margins for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, referring to the country’s high government debt, which is more than 98 percent of GDP, the French government debt needs to be “stabilized” and “reduced,” Le Maire said.
In recent years, there have been repeated appeals from France to Germany to make more public investments to revitalize the European economy.In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
In response to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement, the French government is expected to reduce the new debt to 2.2 percent, up from 3.1 percent expected this year.
Is he still trying to cheat?: Johnson rejects question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson has criticized the parliament's "capitulation law".
The parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still take advantage of a hole. Addressing this possibility, however, the Tory politician deviates.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hidden about whether he intends to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest law passed by Parliament, which is meant to prevent this.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could attempt to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after leaving the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he feels the political clashes over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and showed confidence that the intended exit from the EU will still be achieved: “We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, don’t worry,” Cummings told the British newspaper “Telegraph” during a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist at the British government headquarters at Downing Street.
“The Polaroid Diaries” by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin – they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the greatest rock photographers. But it doesn’t always have to be the great glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Lindas death in 1998, was apparently proud and moved when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwife Chrissie Hynde.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of Linda McCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she came to photography, had the camera always with her. Thousands of Polaroids she made, some hundreds of which are now first published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathtub with a bag on his head, or wears unshaped moonboots. The McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also lived a normal life on their farm in Southern England or Scotland beyond the headlights. Mary McCartney, according to the BBC, said that as a baby she had slept in a bed her father had made out of old potato boxes.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment.Linda McCartney’s recordings are a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It’s about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you, and then you have to cut it at the exact right moment,” said Paul McCartney. “If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo.”And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment.
The light, the composition, the image cutting and the colors are true, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings.
We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighboring country despite US sanctions imposed on Iran.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey has problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies have withdrawn "due to U.S. threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey "especially on this issue and on many other issues will continue our relations with Iran," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic.
Their sanctions have led to a decline in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
U.S. government wants to restrict refugee reception
The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program would be reduced from 30,000 currently to 18,000 refugees.
The U.S. State Department said the United States would continue to support refugees, but its main task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens.
In the future, the U.S. government will focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the statement of the State Department.
The program, which was launched in 1980, will select refugees from UN camps around the world and relocate them to the United States. The 18,000 refugee ceiling for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current 30,000 ceiling is already a low. When U.S. President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legal and illegal - the U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the upcoming fiscal year according to its own data.
Donald Trump – “Closing to a Peak”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblower whistleblowers of espionage.Whoever has provided such information to the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a peak," Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, Trump replied, “This is coming close to a peak.” Then Trump added, “Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now.”
Observers assessed the last comment as a possible reference to the death penalty.The Democrats criticized Trump's statements sharply and accused him of intimidating witnesses.It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible removal procedure against him, the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Services and Surveillance committees in the House of Representatives wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a complaint now published that he abused his office to ask for another country to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it involves his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky in the summer: in the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informant are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat crashes: babies and children drown in the Aegean
Again and again, people are trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece.There are regular boats that are often too small.In the fall of a tube boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants have died in the crash of a tube boat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is believed to be a smuggler, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr,.The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are travelling to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year 174 people died on this route, according to the UNHCR.
The Who cancelled concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who ended shortly because of the impotence of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of a Wednesday evening (local time) performance in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience, "I think I should leave it as long as it still runs."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "cannot really speak right now".Townsend promised the audience to pay for his expenses at a compensation concert.
The Who canceled their planned performances for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, with the 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend being the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly discontinued: WeWork shakes real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has grown into the largest office renter.
Within a few years WeWork will grow from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets.
The crisis of office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer a few days ago, postponed its planned listing and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet to executives in order to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. Additionally, according to the British Financial Times, WeWork has stopped closing new rents with immediate effect.
WeWork leases large office spaces over a long period of time and leases them to members over a short period of time, in part in small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking rate. Last year, the company lost $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs due to the renting of new large spaces are estimated to have risen to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new management is now supposed to take the emergency brake and stop renting new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed lease agreements with durations of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, over the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made the demand for offices in New York greater than the newly marketed areas at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, office vacancies in the U.S. metropolis would have increased during that time, as Alpert wrote in Business Insider.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift significantly without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the principal tenant of an office house in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by the savings fund provider Deka for 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet WeWork’s demands with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, property owners will likely have to write off a portion of the hoped billion revenue. Access to WeWork’s – yet scarce – reserves they do not have, despite the long-term rental agreements. Because the rental of each WeWork location is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has limited liability.
Russia arrested a number of North Korean fishermen
In recent days, a total of 262 fishermen have been arrested for illegal fishing in the waters, the Russian internal intelligence service FSB to Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, border guards were shot and three of them were wounded. This time there were no wounded, it said.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. The Russian Coast Guard, according to its own data, is patroling there to protect its marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish have been discovered. In addition, three fishermen’s and two motor boats have been seized and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard has recorded a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after lawsuits from local businessmen.Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily detained there, according to media in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East Primorje region, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained about the high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. These were also used to remove small living creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where it took 200 years to break down. Even the vessels themselves did not comply with hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the previous week’s arrests.A North Korean who was also injured later died from his injuries.On September 17, Russian border guards first seized a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
U.S. imposes entry ban on former President Castro
The United States has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children.The U.S. State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations".As the head of the Caribbean state's Communist Party, he faces a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. “The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday banned the entry of Venezuelan government and military officials, among others. In Venezuela there has been a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him to kneel and help opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó come to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies.The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors.According to the estimates of the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in suppressing opponents of the government.
Climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are again on the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, Fridays for Future is planning to take action and demonstrations again in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time shift before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major demonstration in Montreal, Canada.
It is relatively unclear how big the global call will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was of good things. “Last Friday more than four million people strike for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!” she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide protesters – about 1.4 million – had participated in the protests, according to estimates from Fridays for Future, in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg stood in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make greater efforts to protect the climate. This soon led to the Fridays-for-Future movement.
Together, they demand more ambition from the politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate catastrophe.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic ride on a high-sea racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she delivered an emotional speech at the UN, speaking to the heads of state and government of the world. In her hometown Stockholm, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Foundation’s Alternative Nobel Prize on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on balconies
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future.This includes a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergencies said in Moscow on Thursday, according to the agency TASS.
Those who still smoke, therefore, must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty will be higher.
Attack on cybercriminals: Investigators take out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time uncovered a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of being the operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel that hosted numerous websites through which international criminals operate their operations.
Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action.The darknet is a sealed part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had crushed in the spring.The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General.
Such a host was discovered for the first time in Germany, a web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, searches were carried out in Germany and in neighboring countries abroad.It was the result of five years of investigation.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are on the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg’s backers?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat up the climate. Even more astonishing is the fact that just a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in front of the man of power of this time. But what lies behind it? Is it willingness or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for her own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and encourages young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man man manages to attract a crowd of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus of Cologne felt elected to fight for a more just world. At that time, he also managed to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the Promised Land, similar to Greta Thunberg’s recent trip to America with a sailing boat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has wealthy PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Even Greta Thunberg's old-tested followers were a little upset about the latest PR show, or the boat trip was probably too thick for some followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits now split: Is it morally right to become financially rich in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock brokers during the world rescue operation? Whatever position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crossing Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected this, but now they have the certainty that a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system.
2I/Borisov: Comet Discovered by Amateur Astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate in our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen in transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole track that leads it out of our system.
The comet has already been observed before its arrival - and can be observed for several months
Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been observed in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. “The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible by mid-size telescopes until April 2020,” explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency NASA.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov raise hope in science
According to the initial findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet – because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the swing star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, de Leon’s colleague Javier Licandro added.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid crashed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely Rejectional': Rachel Johnson is horrifying about brother
First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister whispers the prime minister's warring language with clear words as "tasteless."It's not the brother she knows.
“Capitulation,” “Fraud,” “Contract”: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm – at least verbally.At the questioning hour in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this encountered massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have appeared: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, dragged, divided, tortured and feathered."She thinks this is extremely repugnant. She doesn't recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnson, who appeared at the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she noticed that her brother Jo Cox, a EU-friendly Lower House member who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, had been mentioned in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister now criticized. The perpetrator apparently came from the right-wing extreme camp, which feels "stricken by this kind of language."
The widow of Cox also criticized the prime minister sharply. "It makes me sick if Jos's name is used in this way," he tweeted.The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined for what one believes - no matter what one thinks.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother, Jo, resigned from his position as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I've been torn over the past months between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it's an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson justified the move.
As the Times reports, all 118 Bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England are criticizing the language that “is not worthy of this country.” In a joint statement, they stated, “In recent days, the language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside the parliament.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the mid-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising “an explosion of fun and energy.”
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming NFL football league final.
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained.This sends an important message to all Americans and the world.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer; her worldwide breakthrough was made in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected in the U.S. every time with excitement. This year many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a giant advertising show. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused furor there. Generally, the NFL final is watched by well over 100 million television viewers, it is now extremely popular in Germany too.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up while playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and had been harshly approached by U.S. President Donald Trump, among others. For solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had refused a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock band Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and youtuber accuses Egypt's ruler: For now, Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who removed Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the country’s first freely elected head of state, in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s conduct against political Islam and lost no slogan about human rights violations on the Nile – in a week when Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people because they dared to protest against the president.
In the opinion of the president, the other man, who currently controls what is happening on the streets, is trying to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escapes the access of security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea halls: With his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets", Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language.While the people hunger, the president swallows in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it says.The army leadership, on which Sisi relies his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment.Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the just exploding clicks show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi's seizure of power and 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to go to the streets. But there were individual smaller protests, such as in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber guns. These videos were initially not independently verified. Security circles said the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators last week torn banners with the president’s portrait into pieces, a massive police presence was on Friday. Security forces established checkpoints in the city and on the downtown roads. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city center were closed for “maintenance work”, most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of Mursi’s fallen Muslim brother were hanging up in 2013, until the army took it under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent the unhappy people from gathering: the future party of Sisi wanted to hold a grand meeting for the president just here.
These arrangements led to a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let us not collide with police officers."
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. customers can check themselves in case of notice how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, the Bavarian Consumer Centre explains.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.So the measuring tools of the Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the contract.
"But the providers' tests are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Bavarian Consumer Centre said.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this has no effect even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and in some cases also claim damages.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont spoke in favour of an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be found," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far repressed criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort about it.Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party.Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man to Stay in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home".
Kevin Feige, a Marvel boo, said: “I’m delighted that Spidey’s path in the MCU will continue. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey version.
According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would share 30 percent of the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the "Suits" series in the U.S. has now reached the big final. In the last episode there were many happy ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were honored in a charming way.
One thing to remember: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some backstarts showed again the most memorable scenes with the Duchess today.
However, her real husband, Prince Harry, was also casually mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks toward the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51) Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a narrow comment about his suit.
A baby and four other children drown in boat crash
When a refugee boat crashed in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned.In total, seven people died in the crash, the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year 174 people died on this route, according to the UNHCR.
Together with his French counterpart and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to inform Turkey about "how the refugee situation is," Seehofer said on Friday.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusual number of migrants from Turkey continued to arrive in Greece on Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the deal with Turkey still work?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of the shortage of personnel.In Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are 29,400 people.The worst situation is in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with a capacity for 650 people.
Never before since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 there have been so many, state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is “assuredly” one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature leaps in a short time to create and led to increased heart attacks.
Green politician must be held accountable for embarrassing photography
The head of Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader holds a multi-way cup in her hand on a photo, but now it came out: The cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable cup of coffee with metal stroke has never been held in the hand by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and the cup was still a snack (papp) cup, as by the Canadian National Post.
The Green Party leader must be held accountable for photography
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection."
One user shares a counterview of the photos and writes: “The Greens are manipulating a photo of their presidents to hide their one-way cup.”
May showed herself shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in the hand. The one, however, she put it correctly, was made of bamboo. She always carried it with her. A party spokeswoman said it was only about housing the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something.
"I don't want to call him a fool, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, while asking for something from her over-engaged team: "If you want to edit a picture again, can't you do something with my face so I look younger?"
Even the German Greens have fallen into shitstorms because of their use of single-use plastics or because of air travel - their pictures were not photoshopped, however.
Influencer wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng is said to have been promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade to the Business Class – many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a shift from the Economy Class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew from Taiwan to New York and returned on June 7.
During the flight, Jaqueline’s employees refused to upgrade, even though she presented an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly proposed an upgrade. The letter claims that the influencer was received from an airline marketing employee.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have presented the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the email allegedly originated has denied mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the email system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,280), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights.
Oil prices fall after report on Yemen ceasefire
On Friday afternoon, oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time. Last year, a barrel (159 liters) of North Sea Brent cost $61.83 – about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The Wall Street Journal that Saudi Arabia had agreed to a ceasefire in Yemen in four areas.
A drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had killed five percent of world oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would degrade political tensions in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, we can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank to Bloomberg.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, that repairs at oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September were progressing faster than expected.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco's rapid progress in repairs, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after it was seized by Iran and the recent release.The crew is now preparing for departure while the ship is still anchored, ship chief Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the U.S. has announced that it will deploy missile defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy to Saudi Arabia.Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain has temporarily pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several senior government officials have worked hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July. This was stated by an anonymous whistleblower. Representative House spokeswoman, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "shaming."
North Korea calls Trump and Kim's third summit questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit in the nuclear dispute between power leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump.The meaning and prospects for such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has not done anything so far to implement the decisions of the summit last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said. He also criticized the tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military exercises of the U.S. and South Korea.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he prepared for it. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two sides met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
Prince Harry calls on weapons manufacturers to help clean mines
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically set off and destroyed an explosive mine, dressed in a blue defensive vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he set up the flaming circle. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called on TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but have not helped to escape, to commit to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a soon-to-be interest rate reduction, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on a soon-to-be interest rate reduction by the Bank of England (BoE) boosts the pound sterling.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders. This sparked an interest rate reduction even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to advocate a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of brokerage ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU by 31 October if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
More: With his provocations, the British prime minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Additional Russian Manipulations
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Athletics World Cup, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light – and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and only in turn. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA suspended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed, after an individual examination, at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, around 270 athletes of the country to compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start.
Lack of positive findings
In the following September, the WADA again lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide insight into the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to subsequently punish athletes. Three months later they were finally delivered.
But the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated. “Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the correct data,” David Howman said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday. “We found numerous discrepancies between the data WADA received from a whistleblower and those received from the Russians in January.”
The WM is not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the Athletics Federation holds as the only organization on the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag.
At the beginning of this week, the WADA had already launched manipulations in the space and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens to block the Rusada again and in the worst case also to be excluded from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
