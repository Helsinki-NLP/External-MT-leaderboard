Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the Ebola death rate, so far no cure has clearly proven usable to treat the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggest it is less effective than expected at preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a benchmark to compare three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes that the Olympic family definitely needs to develop a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the UOK that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, than by depriving them of a certificate.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely held theory, but it also provides details that the fossils cannot give us, like color or a three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed stem, called a rakia, but do have other features of feathers  branches and twigs  the researchers concluded that the rakia is probably a later evolutionary achievement than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but more likely for thermoregulation or for display.The researchers speculated that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not a female fleece, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen showed an adult plumage and not a female larva, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however the program was written to simulate an observation made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team looked for the effect that the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter would cause.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds a galaxy like a halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "very much troubling and alarming, because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them are health workers from the hospital.
In the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 other people.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall TB group appears to be small; 6,000 of the 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in the large caves of the Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those that are deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing of an astrogeological team from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed sheet of paper with an indication of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
Once officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the polling station and signs the ballot.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, polling stations have been transparent, so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are available before the election begins and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under careful control, following specific procedures.

He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since remained in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of her son.
She is being held in custody pending formal charges and trial, but any witness statement may be affected as her image has been widely leaked.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists do seem to be approaching a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other details of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecuting, has made it clear to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to have based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other issues to be discussed, it is said, include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the experiment of auxiliary pest control had to be carefully inspected by the foresters while the experiment was being studied and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Association of Sport Shooters (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are being recruited as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a measure to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to organise elections, some of which were postponed from 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod failures are reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) reported that 27 accidents involving the machines are known to it.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple had reported 34 new incidents of overheating, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in her free time.
His research showed that hormone delivery accelerated the maturation of fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes', flight logs, on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Unique enough as she was. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia will never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints led to doubts about his ability.
He could not use medicines needed to survive his pain because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
A few people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could potentially be a source of water supply for the Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets began to collide with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is likely to try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, but also reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate flying vehicles with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being operated, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, no parking lots or park-and-drive options are available on the site.
Fears of lack of transportation have raised the likelihood that the game will be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process likely took longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin fring, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus fring, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in a variety of ways. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
And you can pull it and you get a thin wire that you can fold and you can braid it, you can hammer it or you can roll it into a sheet.
And you can make it very thin and glue it to another metal, and it can be so thin that in the past it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator by using red beet juice.
Rapeseed juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them together in a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and it will make you feel weird, forming a shell, sort of.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a toilet connected to a complicated sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been found in the houses of mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing made possible by the wheel is providing much easier and faster transportation.
It's why we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey in the range from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pet cats) that eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a concept of the niche, a specialization that every cat retains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, they live in groups called herds.
A greg is made up of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave quite similarly to herds of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times more than a strong man.
A tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of rough, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds as much as possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very subtly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will have to, to be a strong competitor, have different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over the course of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take up carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetable. Without vegetables animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its roof of the mouth, which meant that nothing that came into contact with it could escape.
It is not certain, but it may have had a bipedal tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would have no chance against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a glider.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, where they would rest on their sides, eating their own plates.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were not many forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever the discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for storage.
So probably the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unfree.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this too in some way defines the dimension of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural trail and a fairly large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with a congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, as it had no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to bodies of the states, which were often not cooperative.
Nor could it dominate tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before any change, and states related to the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the composition/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, "archipel".
The beginning of Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the native ways of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern border areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for shooting still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the era of analogue film.
It's still in production today, but, more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, a little confusing, 36mm wide and 34mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much-insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline that creates dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the object of critical study.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power touched everyone from a king to a common citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary resources exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether this dogma was obeyed.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by a number of international treaties from the past two centuries.
Britain traversed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because such a tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to prevent a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; each era in China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods, a fierce battle took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest chair in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of this everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" mark looks like a V and the "down" mark looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arc usually produces a more delicate sound, while the downward arc is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed arcs are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Lady Elizabeth on 6 October 1789 were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of bazaar women.
They drove to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the windows of the carriage wide.
At one point a mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenditures of the US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to compensate for a large portion of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the surplus profits derived from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that helped the founding of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is usually called the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies consequences that are inherently its own, and not socially determined.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time appeared customs and culture associated with that geography, and these, more in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century its status deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of the media, styles in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major achievements of the period was that people began using buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using stored seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase a crop.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel ignored by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often mark their membership with recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, were not socialized by adults because of neglect, bad luck or malicious abuse.
Some of the children who were made to be wild were imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such a child's abandonment was due to the rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Children who became feral could experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
Raised only by nonhuman animals, the savage child shows behaviors (within the framework of physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the certain caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of a scaffold and the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into software and is supposed to ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner to do if he acted alone.
Children find themselves in a guardianship for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, but it happens anyway.
We see the guardianship system as a safety zone for these children.
Our guardianship system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A trusteeship must provide all that was lacking in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give additional dimensions to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" as new motivating aspects when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech suggested that people who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even speculates that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the range of visible variation.
Splitting and recombining remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from available plants.
And, in addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slower growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest resource available from plants would be protein, which you can get from leaves and beans, but those are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Taking all the circumstances into account, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Hypnosis is the process of intentionally waking during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do that by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without being fully awake.
If you notice that you reset the clock while you sleep, it may be left on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other biorhythm-based options is to drink plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before bed, this will make you get out of bed to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is negatively correlated with the degree of stress in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the way to that goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and imagery.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By imagining various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a collision of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
"It was going to last the next 40 years and have real battles, with surrogate armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods while at the same time restricting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most recent examples include the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills and other pastures, often cared for by goatherds, who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railways have been built in England since at least the 16th century.
Although railways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Spatulas appeared early enough to hold the rails in place. Little by little, however, it became clear that rails would be more efficient if they had a iron strip on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused a faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was by walking, humans began walking vertically two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright human).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk vertically as often.
Two-legged specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes are believed to have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is like taking anti-symptom medication in many ways, but if we want to go beyond a temporary solution, then we need to find the causes of the problems and we need to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and the problems have been made greater by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten excerpt signed by the Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and lives today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and nails, they shed eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers we use today are based on processing information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term bug is a formal term used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and bed bugs are nest-builders, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or their child's best interests, at best.
Such couples may choose to plan for adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand by scientific method how the world works. This method actually guides most of scientific research.
It is not alone, however; it is also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself torn from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend critically on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms that don't simply respond to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of self-repeating functioning even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses about DNA being genetic material.
What Hershey and Chase did was they used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the enveloped piece of genetic material and whether the enveloped cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the view, including flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting Borneo and taking pictures and learning about orangutans there.
Every morning people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting everyone is involved in some way and contributes to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has been shaping the biosphere from one of its stable states that has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or about collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems follow such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict a driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; thus traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent a traffic flow, relations were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, develop and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take off. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
Which made sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km long and collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza in size and technical dexterity of their construction.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements  such as gold, silver and copper  since antiquity because these are found in nature in a basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he further theorized that they were becoming new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that have small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil has fallen into a decline in status and use.
People are now typing text messages on their computer screens without ever having to stand near a pencil tip.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope. So splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It is less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick, so it was easier for lava to spill onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what is about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is an effort to remain one of the friends (or girlfriends).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, assessing work efficiency, assigning tasks and demanding responsibility from people.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she needs to change everything that the team has done before, and own it.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this kind of behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local managers.
The presence of a real Invisible Team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functioning departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition, so it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior leads scientists to go further.
It's a long-known fact that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumors, affect behavior and alter some brain functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong scientific fiction undertone, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves the manufacture of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the branches of economics, medicine, engineering and military, it is also embedded in some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is another great way to think about travel and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, a new version of the website is released every year, but the old versions remain available to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling errors, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of someone else's writing and also outline their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a host of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things make Ontario what outsiders think is inherently Canadian.
Vast areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
This comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens combined.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or attached to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it became deeply rooted in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama pioneered the Caba Road from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marriage.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to give in (cultural or otherwise, a difference is not necessarily tolerable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benemerines as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them under the name Casa Branca, but they left after a earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is among the most uninteresting places in all of Morocco.
Around the old town it is easy to find shops of traditional Moroccan goods, such as Tajins, ceramics, leather goods, nargill and a whole range of sparkling goods, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially in the city center, with its magma.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must check every visit outside of it to know the status of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to drive through Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the Red List of World Heritage Sites due to the threatened sands from the desert.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports a different fauna.
It represents one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most emblematic among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glowing histogram, which is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross into the front, which is located on the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban growth on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land that has been reclaimed from the sea on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a handy place to start looking.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) across the coast further into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The forest is not just a swamp of mangroves, however. It contains some of the last refuges of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganga plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966, Sundarbans became a game reserve and it is estimated that in its territory there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sightings.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those driving west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Public taxis are quick and comfortable means of transport to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide and it has two corridors 3,50 m wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters away. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs crossings will be completed as planned.
The Guaraníes were the most notable indigenous group living in this area, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as La Gran Provincia de las Indias, was formed as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the Polish fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check with Asociación Argentina de Polo for news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value has been equated to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be changed at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outer islands, but you can take British and American money; ask in advance to see which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to change Falklands currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in it, while in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get to freezing, but wind and humidity combine and so you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate rainy and dry seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities ask that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all big beasts are capable of attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a proper distance. Since these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, guard their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, and therefore avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the town marked the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbours. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are at the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can safely swim, and most have shade from pohutukava trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They're sometimes crowded family beaches with shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many good wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
The Australian concept of coffee is foreign to them. The expression is "short black", the cappuccino has plenty of cream (not foam) on it, and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standards of Belgium. The juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozos appear near beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and they would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through such agents.
Travel agents generally provide plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to get to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get you other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must however be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on site and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a tented position next to the music.
Remember, music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you sail the northern Baltic in winter, take care of the location of the cabin, because going through ice causes quite terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from cruise ships are exempt from visa (check the conditions).
Casinos normally go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special foods, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them inside.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness harms mental capacity and every good gambler knows how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore you cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or wind, by condensation, by ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari is popularly used with the meaning of a land trip to observe the amazing African fauna, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and ordinary tools give good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes appear to be fearful, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a field walk, a hike safari, or a hike) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are probably in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but, in the case of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing machines available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If a iron is not available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you may try using a dryer if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause a burn damage in it).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiency, and if you're concerned about that, consider buying the water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a human by force are generally not counted as plagues.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, at times traversing isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be very careful: most of the time there are steep slopes, narrow corridors and winding roads.
Signal speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the front and rear sections  often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and they are strictly enforced, even more so than otherwise.
It is noteworthy that mobile phone service is however much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the neighbor to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit cakes that contain apples all year round, cherries and prunes in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually go especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich cakes, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a food consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A caviar can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a vast term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy foods, with the flavors favored by Javanese, namely peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Hanging on either side of the saddle, the feet serve as supports at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety concerns, as the rider's feet could possibly get trapped in them.
If, while riding, one falls off a horse and the foot is caught by a footing, one could be dragged by a horse that is running away. To minimize this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and sole that are smooth and fairly narrow.
Additionally, some saddles, mostly English saddles, have safety bars such that a rider falling can pull back to unhook a pedestrian belt from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer stunning views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Low-altitude winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one skates down on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts who are known as Ski-obsessed and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing is considered a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first ski club in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called field skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It refers to alpine-style skiing or mountain climbing, but it usually does not involve them, as these last occur on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were a hiking route.
Under good conditions you can cover slightly greater distances than walking, but very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on busy roads.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries one needs to complete visa applications and passport controls again.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this respect as if it were one country.
Provided one stays within this area, one can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves you time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what kind of goods are antiques. Some tax agencies count as antiques goods that are over 100 years old.
Because the definition varies by location, in places like North America, there may be a lower age limit than in Europe.
One could count handicraft as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
The breeding of buffalo is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding its trade is important for many other craftsmen as well.
Even in tradition, not all Sami however engaged in large-scale buffalo farming, but they lived off fishing, hunting or something similar, using buffaloes mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern jobs. Tourism provides important income to the Sami region of Samoa.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially by non-Roma people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued against the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even if they are directed to their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might be in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simple compared to the more detailed information you may have elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disturbance or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of different types that depend on the location, the terrain and the atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are presentations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, thromboses and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly recommended that travelers be aware of all kinds of severe weather risks that affect their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An online search for a hostile environment course will most likely show the address of a local business.
A course will generally cover all the matters presented here much more in detail, normally with practical experience.
One course normally lasts two to five days and includes acting, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wild, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo a sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return trip.
The willingness to deliver passports without an X or updated documents matching a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether governments in other countries are willing to accept this type of document also varies greatly.
Security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Unoperated transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Surfing is the backward flow of waves broken at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater diverse formations, the retroflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a rapid flow to depth can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been noticed, you might prefer to wait until you're rescued.
The rebound shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty in re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When people first traveled abroad, they probably had patience and understanding, because they knew that travelers needed to adjust to the new country.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed with the travelers returning home.
The pyramid show of sound and light is one of the most interesting children's activities in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a novel.
The Sphinx is set in the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and they have the most bases, sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, whose flooded caldera of an still active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
After joining the plateau here, the peninsula's mountains later reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 kilometers long and bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4892 m high.
In very remote areas without access to a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only resource.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for cell phones, because one must be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ones, as well as expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider could tell you more about how to connect to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is becoming increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates because it gives them a year off before they go to college, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a sabbatical abroad, it can actually improve your chances of advancing to higher education when you return home.
Normally there will be an entry fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the adjacent archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any kind of yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak give a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is seen only in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. But it is a rather unique statistic (e.g. in the Netherlands one in forty people own a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships additionally include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can make full use of a few days to visit the historic city, returning at night on the ship to sleep there.
If one disembarks only by the cruise excursions, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As you can see above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience regardless of your age and background, especially if you've never flown before or if you've had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislike of related things that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how a plane works, and what happens during flight, can help overcome the fear that is based on not knowing or being in control.
Courier companies get good money for quick delivery of things. Time is often very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
In some lines, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but there has been a problem in other lines and small companies.
If they sent goods by cargo plane, on some routes it could take several days in the performance of unloading and customs.
The only way to do this faster was to send things like checked bags.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very thick cash package for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: by rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the trouble of looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, situated on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers, scattered are traditional red-tiled roofs, markets of the 18th century and old mosques and churches, but the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and on it is an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the courtyard of the church are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth taking a half hour to walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its great merits.
The bus line 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place with almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here and there are many more people who have loved ones who have been killed or forced to work there to their death, whether Jewish or not.
Please behave in the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site with markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost all speak Spanish.
But most of the posters are in Catalan, since the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisans have earned a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
This is often just a vague stereotype, but the best way to keep a smooth relationship with Parisians is to behave as if you are bien élevé (well-educated). This will make the journey much easier.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, pear and fir, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the variety of microclimates, diverse terrains and different elevations.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse range of animals and bird species.
There you can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and urogall, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear knee-high skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide laundry for women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own laundry, especially if it's brightly colored.
Similarly, men must wear pants up to the knees.
You can also borrow one from the storage room at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, and so you may not feel comfortable if you wear these skirts. There is one size fits all!
Mallorca's cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato and any available additive, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, except for the word Sie with the meaning you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing becomes a little more complicated because it is necessary to know whether a verb or adjective is used in the noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters most worth paying attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, it is imperative to pronounce r and rr differently: tsar means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
So reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, speaking a Romance language will make learning Portuguese easier.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning it separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are today obsolete and they remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution back then wasn't a problem like it is today, they're usually in cities or university campuses, places that are easier to get to than the ones built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where a plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Since plants look best in a natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to remove specimens, not even one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you arrive, you can buy almost anything there.
But still, since you'll be in the High Tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to fight the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to use goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation on.
For example, it would be possible to visit castles in the Luerval or the Rhine valley, or to go on a cruise to interesting towns on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of well-known hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere throughout the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, Easter is spent awake in the open air to watch the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil and the parishioners begin celebrating just after midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the archipelago came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost always.
You can also enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Costumes are the standard work clothes and employees address each other by surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is paramount, as is emphasizing group effort over praising individual achievements.
Workers must usually get their superiors' approval for all decisions made and they must obey the instructions without question.
