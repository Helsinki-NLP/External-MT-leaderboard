UKIP residents who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not serve to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use special arguments, then you discredite them by a barely covered homophobia.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to make the tail behind chronic hypocondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you are using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right cingles, practically does not exist.
This is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation taken from a torchon is not a proof.
Shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such a populist propaganda as if it was reality.
I don’t think you know what a special argument is.
You don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you’re trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
The phrase of Farage was very surprising, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He did not make any homophobic comments.
You will have to succeed in getting it back.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don’t like when the media talk about what you don’t like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his cingles of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own incapacity to understand that the complexities of mankind are something good, then no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes, the austerity period will have nothing arranged.
Expecting 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the “Tiger of Europe” was praised by us a few years ago.
We knew the following.
It begins to read the article again.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a “new economic miracle” is taking place.
With the Brussels Agreement, tax on the lowest companies in Europe, a flexible workplace, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there’s nothing to “pavoise” for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long, quiet river, it is on the light of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe.
It is false!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France from the policies on the tax actually paid by multinationals.
If we believe a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only small and medium-sized enterprises pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on all corners of the street, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is obvious in the daily locks since the return.
Should this be the current economic situation?
Don’t worry, I’m sure the comments will soon burn up.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hang on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bosses and rays on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once rafistolated.
That would be the other pilot’s fault.
Did Ryanair pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish, you could not allow yourself to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it’s Ryanair, so they can give themselves to joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic fee have to just take it on themselves, etc.
It is quite transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what will be the delays and if it will need to compensate the passengers and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport controller.
Passengers were placed in another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that takes the British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally grows people.
People don’t come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some, mostly) nor for the Salon de la revue at Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dustful).
The reason for this crowd is that the stores are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
There are many foreigners who spend...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, filled with people with 50% of tourists.
I am false!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees benefit, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister of Economy, nor the Minister of Foreign Affairs have any authority to reform the Labour Code.
As they lock it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a portion of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture.
This is also the work time regulation.
The way of life he defended firmly against fascism
The way of life he defended firmly against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against his will, used to pay the succession fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Per his succession would like his part of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
His preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I also not.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he held the head of the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a “agreement” with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money from the cost of succession, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It is as simple as that.
But we could use the money of taxes.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A resurrection of the internal market by public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure buildings by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms proposed by the minister, they well reflect the real evil: the unbelief to the dialogue
Return to Principles.
The reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Or solidarely we come to his help, or he has the right in exchange for the services he provides or has provided at a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lender who lives from the income of his property.
It is necessary to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the one who lives from his retirement.
A good to rent or even two for a couple above, it's vice
The small finance genius is lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but in a time of lack of large infrastructure.
In Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially in a time when the question of decrease arises in response to a recession which is just a wild and thus brutal decrease.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) of shelters, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is crying: isolation, rail network renovation, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that favors high income and rents.
Who is in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a galopin.
Samsung’s profits are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of bigger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have attracted buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all of these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for the benefit of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to boost competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don’t attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price premiate.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a better platform.
Is there “a better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is of our interest to all.
I’m glad you’ve found exactly what you’re looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even if I’ve made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight the ideas and not the men (in contrast, well on the Paris bobs) could tell us of which author(s) they fight the ideas on gender and tell us the works they intend just fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you well, and you are someone intelligent and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato referring to Holopherne, a proximity that had not come to me (I don't have his vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the “found”, since you refer to it, this topic doesn’t interest me, and honestly I don’t see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my retardation, because I’m slow but I understand well...
@Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid to ask the world?
What are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us elements of response.
The first invoicing the Judith of the Bible, the second calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutting machine.
We can see how many of these studies affect the most intimate in their homes.
We are no longer in the debate.
This is something different, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: When it comes to an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To pretend to fight ideas from the only exposed by their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I do not understand the nuance.
I didn’t read Judith, the very symbolic necklace, I satisfied myself with the “Second Sex” (it was more than my time) which is I believe the source of “the source” according to Lo’s wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly appeared when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated somewhat the disappointment of having sometimes the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fantastic here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really cover the Victoria and NSW coast, while the majority of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special Blood Moon Flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
It obsesses you, right?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of Perseid meteor rain and for almost all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even if things improve greatly on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse due to the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I will put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just as the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends (needly) by disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them EUX of being obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above the Harbour Bridge in Sydney.
Mars is going to collide with Earth.
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
There is no inequality between income and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the Babylonian Gardens.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that one can make an opinion.
Go to see today Tuesday 15 October the results of miraculous revenue: in Spain, exports are at the lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock exchange collapses.
But these are the examples to follow.
The notary reform would generate a demand for compensation of approximately €8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if the Ministry of Economy fails?
Will the decision makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the bold attack of the notaries have the same courage when submitting the invoice to the state budget?
The next in his time.
Ok, thank you JYL.
The state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget as the state’s time horizon is theoretically infinite while the household horizon is limited by the lifetime of its members.
Furthermore, unless the public expenditure is considered improductive, it contributes to the financing of material and immaterial investments which guarantee tomorrow’s growth and thus future revenue.
A few elements of answer.
This is a regrettable decision.
But remember the holy oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first of all.
Great theory of conspiracy.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
In these matters, politicians want to please the unculted masses.
In fact, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That’s why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don’t make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like the U.S., you should know how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courtized in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It might have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is in free sale or just on prescription.
This strengthens it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently doing trials on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that stop them and the expensive necessary permits.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines are likely not to be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who get to a version that offers good quality products in well-known doses will benefit largely.
Sorry to tell you, but you’re wrong, there’s a lot of things happening in the background for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a head of that hospital.
There is no patent on the grass.
If “researchers” in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, one could be using their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not seeking.
To compare is to do pedagogics not research.
You can’t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment with everything.”
If your research is successful, why do you experiment?
If your research fails, why do you ask them to be applied?
Can we explain how a “researcher” can conclude that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow learning under the condition that students learn to use new technologies but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don’t know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying to us.
What does it mean to build an indicator that informs you of what’s going on, a will to promote yourself, a trick?
One trail to train teachers is to remove sophisticists and ideologists from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Factory review the paragraph on the stages (which unfortunately is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most ineffective conservatism: “This is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not allow the system to progress.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only the practitioners teach the practitioners, even if they have all their place in a modern teachers training.
The theorists of education should have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set a foot in an operational block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would be destroying it permanently.
Your analogy is completely foolish: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would not like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the crowd.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative Deputy responsible for the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why didn’t he simply tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, I’ll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
This is the same because they need to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license does not cost anything.
This is a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the appropriate license, you deprive the artists of their winning bread.
You can still discuss peddant assumptions - but it’s theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it will not become true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Go and repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
It does not seem to bother you from depriving the artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school tasks, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to deprive them of this fictitious income.
The lesson number 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Per if they share the headsets of their mp3 rider with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for having violated the law in this way.
Oh, if we could export that resource we’re filled with, the cracker who says everything goes wrong....
If it is a PS member who says that, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they will be in the age of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed until then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
I have always worked in a private company.
I had the chance to have worked in companies led by excellent business managers: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to throw red balls on the zero patrons I often encounter.
Comfortable in my baskets I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium and small - What are French employers expecting to do so?
Does the state hold their hands?
The state they accuse of imperialism.
by Jacques L.
Always this anti-entrepreneurial coupling from your part!
Remember me, what have you created as employment, as added value, to be so severe?
I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders incapable of creating jobs and who bound and minoute while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It is terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the lowest wages otherwise their abolition!
I'm looking forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this topic.
What’s ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep on flow instead of transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we have no power to do that.
I’ve tried them recently, but I didn’t succeed.
But well, the Labour will get us bored, isn’t it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They are already running trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and participating in the tender.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all that so that the decision is finally cancelled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for eight years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated us during the referendum campaign, is completely for joining and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other beyond the borders.
I hope you will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on good trails while the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“It was a striking girl.”
I hate this kind of expression, but I hate this kind of expression.
To assume that being “battant” is a higher quality than many others, the care of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being “battant” has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: cancerous “battants”, who are not less dead, I know palancées.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
We’re going to start again too.
I don’t tell you that this is the condition to manage, I tell you that it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit.
When it comes to the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I start again.
Insisting, even for a moment, that one can have a merit to get out of a disease or that one can desmerite not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C is?
Narrated to think the opposite, if, having a solid morality allows to readily accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not reject them by fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is above all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to go back to the “God” it’s something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you take yourself to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I’ve caught two, dirty, big, and if I’ve “batted” myself as these psychologists say, it’s completely escaped me.
Unless this struggle consists only in stretching the teeth, suffering the hell and cutting the strikes.
I thought the charges against Milosevic had been decided and ended a decade ago.
I have not seen this name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What is happening?
It is a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “fast” and then scattered under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at that time?
The Communist became a nationalist who has triggered three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The President of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia.
Please ask what we voluntarily left away: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the LESS Rule of International Law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to get out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roll.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to separate a part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was well-recognized by the Western states which then lie from the end to the end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he did not understand the situation that had evolved.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of earthquake forecast is approximately running, measuring the piézoelectric level in the quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly helpful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located approximately 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine from the University of Maryland.
Method to follow.
Just like those involving animals who feel a threat to happen.
Thanks Passenger of Science to give us, often, of these experimental skills that are carried out in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
It is due to the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of a earthquake.
For example, the radon.
A gas a priori inodore for humans but detectable by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for man, but not for the measurement instruments he has.
But we have no reliable results on these tracks.
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen an art reporting that tells about the struggle of two teams of scientists, one California and the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to Earth’s magnetic fields, and more specifically their modification before a earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses have convinced me.
Or are we talking about this research?
Why so much disregard for this track?
We must learn to listen to nature.
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one neglect it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we collide in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish was strange round.
I don’t understand that one can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did so much as the mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can’t stop thinking that this man doesn’t know anything about it and that he always tries to divert with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presentator asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as a mayor and he did not hold one.
It’s just to emphasize how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a shit, isn’t it?
Because it is popular.
Because it is funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You”.
Because it is a celebrity and it has been inculced to people the worship of celebrity.
The people voted for him and the same will be for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party’s leadership, the Tories’s popularity rating will break the ceiling I’m sure.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be one of them.
That’s exactly what we said about London.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, more intelligent than him.
In many ways, I think he is trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as the President.
The French have truly and always disinterested themselves with the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been worth reading a few books (there is, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the “Salomon” and the “Ferrari Strait” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there in the bottom since the Battle of Savo), don’t want to go back there.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the “Iron Bottom Sound”.
Even if the mission reaches its end.
They are the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total burning.
Calculate the kerozen consumption to the goal completely decreditates the concept.
You just need to browse the list of sponsors that philanthropes.
This is an operation of no more and no more to do.
The cow is too much!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recit makes me see again, identifying me a little at the passage (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L’Elorn to the White Moulin in the line of Brest!).
Sheep also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the deplacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to see us again, and show with fierce that the Bretons are great travellers!
from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red bonnet that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Britain and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of some adventurers even as sympathetic as those there!
Are there players in the current Serbian training who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
It is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfield or before in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he's from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great Velez team who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in the second place in the Yugoslav League (and also had points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Thank you Mole!
I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just for curiosity, what happened in Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
I can’t help you here.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he is not holding there.
Maybe he can do something else, in the Indian Super League?
And seriously Serbia.
No fear, no fear, no fear, no fear.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which covers all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an albanese flag with the map not of what is called the Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give bouts of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt a “explosion of joy” seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How to ???
What annoys me a little in this “testimony” is that the only fact that I could, even once, spontaneously rejoice the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a “border line” personality whose “testimony” should be taken with the greatest caution.
Unlikely that in the short moment of “joice” we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One would have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically hurt the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Do qqch of powerful.
of grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims raised by their feeling of humiliation.
Films filmed in Palestine.
The classic Schadenfreude.
I doubted a little.
The West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I’m talking about Cairo or Alger fauburgs, not tours of Dubai.
The glory of the past, magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can the Muslim world get out of this devil?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of the existing powers and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freeze of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
As it was previously understood, Muslims should not go back.
This is the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I think this is true in many countries.
But in the UK, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, moist and depressive months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
And everyone gets sick.
The seasonal depression.
I suffer myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in the UK, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to breathe in autumn.
Not as much to breathe as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In the UK, if you are lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grincheux cheerful of clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to the bacteria outside, it can change, I guess.
It’s not about to die, it’s just a step in a cycle.
A wonderful step full of drunk odors, with a feverity that culminates with holidays such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowfall and full of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things.
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child increases, it is the amount incurred by the state that comes essentially from deciles 8 to 10.
But as regards the number of households that saw their taxes increase as a result of this measure, it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned (median income) according to graph 2 .
The elimination of the half-part concerning mostly the widows is not at all treated in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: €230M is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and underestimates that it is painless.
And it is not ready to deal.
We are not on the palm, but dreams.
If the PS is a rather leftist, we will not cry.
It is obvious that those who are among the 20 percent wealthiest have to suffer much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue so and you’ll encourage these 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it is not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Live the Trots and the OCI recycled at the PS: they have all understood.
Adam, you see badly what you look at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its utility.
And once the usefulness of money is overcome, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the unfortunate of the greatest number.
We are among the rich 20 percent.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which are logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or so much to lower your arms and live social minimis, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopies of the red khmer headsets have happily lived.
I have done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
There is no problem.
In one of the two, we had things we’t have in a 5-star hotel and we didn’t have to present ourselves at the reception or face any trouble.
You just have to go to someone, sleep there, sit behind and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I’m on a trip.
The logo has changed, the people have changed.
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
6 hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” Not that’s not true.
You just missed luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his release, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
In 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23 817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I love airbnb, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to calm me.
I’m thinking of paying a fee and a month rental at once but I’m a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard about.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie singed on all the tones.
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that it will delight the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds killed in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succeeded in something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay kind).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered 20 years later were still usable?
This is not hyper clear the style of the author: “in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree well.
You believe it is time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
It is never time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
We would already strengthen the education of a lot if we made them work 35 hours instead of 17.
Currently, our teachers earn more than engineers.
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen as the National Education has no means to provide an office in college/high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of compulsory telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Moreover, it’s so much the table at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can’t fill the CAPES of maths, come, we’re waiting for you.
Why don’t you want to catch yourself with the poorly educated sheep that your parents scratch you by treating you as a blurry?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm jihadists so that the Kurdish population can prosper better.
It is clear that the Bush administration has done everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and it was still a job for which it needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I have never regretted.
Don’t worry about this if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don’t like doing so much in business, so I hope to go either in the public office or in the university world.
LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I got my graduation in 2011 there was already a three-year retardation.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of the fields like art / literature / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what we call unemployed degrees.
I have one of these degrees and I have finished production director.
It turned out that the important was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good professional path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but we quickly rise the scales because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This engineering/artistic studies debate has lasted for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work in time and interact with people in a way to get results.
Are literature, philosophy, and art a big deal?
It is ridiculous.
I suppose you are talking about media study genre degrees or no matter where you’ve gone.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and put them in value.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to disarm Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I don’t see the inhabitants of the end-of-the-country of the Essonne and Val-d’Oise go 80km every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the intra-mur and the small belt already have many otherwise more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
Several secure and closed parks, as already exists in northern European cities, in Dijon or in Lyon, will be installed on the road.
A good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, the City of Paris is expected to work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They will benefit from their great experience in the field.
There is no place for a single bicycle.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it is not okay at all.
When we talk with pedestrians and other public transport users of the reasons why they don’t pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it’s hyper dangerous with all these wagons, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and worry about the survival of bicycles 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the cycling trails are dirty go, it’s necessary to reduce the traffic (urban pedestrian type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), make respect the road code by verbalizing systematically (even the bicycles to the bicycle presil it’s necessary to adapt the road code for the bicycles it’s 100 years ago), generate the bicycles to the bicycles to the bicycles to the bicycles to the bicycles to the bicycles
The cyclable pistes are apartheid, it is necessary to cohabite but re-balance the occupation of the urban space.
Nothing about the bicycle in Paris.
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15 per cent of Velo deplacement is ridiculous.
I begin to believe that Anne Hidalgo has rolled the green in the flour.
In other words, the EELV adjunct appears to be skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Indeed, it is not Russia.
I am not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
Moreover, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed while waiting for the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that would come from it.
There is no Pan Am 103 explosion in Libya.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down earlier, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could, of course, be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the light of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent for airlines to pay overflight fees from the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpating government/the ultranationalists of western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate in large that Putin has shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
A 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the rebels of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this matter go to the CIJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such an eco-beotian is sad!
Calling yourself Polar is losing the north is pleasant.
One only Beethoven question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t stop noticing that those who most virulently criticize Piketty’s book have not read it!
It’s easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today’s capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration takes back after the beginning of the 20th before 1914.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paper knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given about it is right or not.
If it is right, it can be discussed without reading the book, whose essence is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
It is easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paved summarized by the press false?
I have not read it and will not read it.
So I trust the summary of his central thesis and this is the one that seems pure fumistery to me.
The difference between rich and poor is subsidious.
Is humanity not enriched?
And this enrichment added to the growth of the population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember that she is only 17 years old.
A age at which most people just begin to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that colored pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness to Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere – not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was somewhat strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she wasn’t where she’s now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Is Malala itself not a part of these “colored pervers”?
You should not have any “antenne time” on this site.
You are a terrible perverter.
It is absolutely revolving.
Her father was not going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 years old when she was shot.
His father leads a school where girls are taught and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receives higher education and that she has the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, he is someone unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl should often marry at the age of 14, without having a word to say.
I'm sorry that she didn't say it sufficiently eloquently for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
A lot disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little bit of trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich's character.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronic Life on Mars is simply overwhelming.
I have not yet watched this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all at once than to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, in addition to the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it’s mostly the risks of scenes and assemblies that sedured me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the aseptication of today’s productions.
I’m a little missing to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to assess the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things yet.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really A Pillar of the series beyond technical qualities.
Well, I look at her a lot.
Then I find the series sin by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly down, in season 2 it was too dispersed despite some great episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end as 24 hours.
Everyone does what he wants!
It’s because I say “I’m not going to look later” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
After that, that’s just my opinion.
Let’s talk about less tax increases, please – coups rather in state spending.
Please increase the expenditure.
Those who wanted to pay money failed.
Discourse controversies about relatively small spending positions, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the error margin in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call from their wishes and throughout this time some, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them of bad faith.
Less than 1% of the expenditure.
The “duty” means assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
Debt is nothing to worry about.
I’t see any problem that the government will take up a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would take advantage of it properly.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the approximately unnecessary wind subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost twice as they should, you get to a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem taxes on the most luxurious residents seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking spending and the car vinet, and that’s before VAT.
Nearly exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car vignet.
I’m paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed who is looking for a job in the door-to-door prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed don’t look for, it means that 80% are looking and don’t find.
As I am unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 cv, this increases my chances of even more.
Indeed, I have not had any news about Employment Pole for months, that means that the agents are more busy with control operations than actually bringing job ads back?
I don’t see interest.
It is not the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to avoid Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case it is assured that the unemployed well fulfil their duties in exchange for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title to the users of a means of transport, a service manager or the employees of their work, etc.
There is no scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to remind that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had affairs in Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been wrongly established, and on one of the records, amputed by 40%, it had to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
The registration and control is at the top at the moment, while statutoryly Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of the compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the complaints.
Politicians and non-salary French give themselves the rights they do not have!
This is not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the value of employee labour.
More than waiting for murderer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, it is necessary to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Pest in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the movements of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of mind to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa applications rejected due to their country of origin or their recent trips.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the variole in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Is it to be heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was a simple good sense but apparently those who know decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
No one goes out.
Only health staff can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating the patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took “all necessary precautions.”
The progress of this disease can be stopped.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
Moreover, customs officers at the airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
May he succeed in sending the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and he will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to raise in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this concept.
It’s only 20 years ago that information has appeared as the prime given to mankind, while religion, coming from the brain, has directed our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a second Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize will not in any way put the feet to the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too “anxiogenic”?
@louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, it may be able to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you think existed in Christ.
Hillel once said, “Do not to others what you don’t want them to do to you, it’s all the Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "to advance justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
The next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has distorted the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
The Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to promote justice, peace, and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mostly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I’m too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
The new game is coming soon.
It is not invented.
I personally would choose.
I like Wasteland 2 (I’ve even participated in its funding campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount bonus.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount bonus.
I will look.
Of course not at work.
The computing department’s discounts block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% discount, or is the £30 includes the 20% discount?
Note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's null.
It’s time to buy a new video card.
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thanks, I'd be afraid that one day they'll delete it from your library if they decide to seve against the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
This is the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France of 1940 a “pudry land”?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift.
Do we have to love France of 40, that of “the strange defeat”?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the awarded authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano which is already hardly readable in French and describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel prizes are more credible but honestly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his right value, if they don’t know it already!
On your side, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I agree with your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
Let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
In 2005, D.
Congratulations to the terrible.
Since I’ve been driving one in Iceland, I’ve never stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think that thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to break me.
Is it like Superman III's horrifying computer?
Hello Dantra, always hatred?
Hi DQ - no, not today, I took my medocks.
It is Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was Bordeaux.
I’ve been able to taste 19 different beer, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favourites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fanatics (not to confuse with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was hard.
On Monday night we went to a puppy's grandfather to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a genuine start-up opportunity I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach 95 years I will be as alive as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That is said, without wanting to bother you, I think you are getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits the missions for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
We are informing about weapons trafficking.
Whether you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Sorry, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental counter-sens: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslims or not, having formally condemned the Islamic State and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn’t say consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and inadequate to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt.
This principle is, in my opinion, the denial of the Republic and can only contribute to the deliberation of the French society.
If there is no doubt, say it.
Who does not say consent, but what does it mean?
Consent to a proximity with ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the sheep and the sheep.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically inaccurate.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, “venge” the parties represented in Westminster because an enormous gap broke between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster.
Cameron has to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland because they have no seats there.
They can do whatever they want in impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
He will throw tears for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he signed the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
It is not surprising that some Workers' Deputies ask for accounts to their leader.
If the SNP gains 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have promised for a maximum decentralization.
I think that’s the most important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Cutting the 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
Moreover, once the Scottish MPs will no longer be able to vote on topics that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband yes.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists and it succeeded him well.
However, he is still in the league to be Prime Minister in 2015 and that since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, generally, these boxes will virtually be behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the “Life of the Others” of Eastern Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC.
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the end, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I have to read hacked files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer file-free.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it is unfortunate.

It is the data published by Kobo that is so, not allowing neither to identify readers nor authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, wrong and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a maternal class full of schizophrene under acid.
It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It’s interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not my. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot a ball in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually shooting a shot in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian president Bashar al-Assad because it would put Israel’s security in danger.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of repressions or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and U.S. diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who pay attention to the details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read taking into account the realist observations / previous warnings coming from Iran to offer from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are those “moderate” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the pervers of ISIS?
The pipeline policy pushes the world to the abime and I would suggest those referring to “moderate” inexistent to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Is there any other religious fundamentalist in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial is needed for the Armenian genocide committed by Turks.
Should it be “need”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance to be alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Would the criminals not be a little old now, the genre 120 years old?
A little late for that, right?
Specifically concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War for revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a paved place in Central Asia at approximately the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.

I don’t know why there’s so many disgraceful comments about what Paul Mason says, they’re posted by people who’ve never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there’s a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the northern culture of England.
Nothing surprising that Paul Mason has well understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That is said, you can take an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here’s a little well written and well thought article.

The Palestinians have no partners for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (i.e., that was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
They were stolen by a Israelis.
The Israeli representative stood angry and spoke, “What do you talk about?
The Israelis were not there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiles and adds: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard.
That it dislikes the anti-Israelians is an obvious, it’s not the aim sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This is the case since the world is globalized.
Avoidation and avoidance.
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
You do not respond to the creation of Israel.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a relationship of force!

In addition, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have difficulty going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskysts not written by others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it well, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, truths to which one prefers not to think.
Keep up, this feeling will become more and more widespread.
I can understand why Brand horrors some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross the arms and to ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman’s interview and other articles/video that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (at slightly different degrees) governing essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and the rich, at no time he says to simply ignore completely the politics because these parties do not govern in our name: he is just to say that it is just to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to say that it is to be
I don’t say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go along with the fact of voting, given that politicians are giruets who will change their opinion if they really risk losing the elections), but it’s angry to see all those condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells the young people not to take the pain of voting and just hope that everything will go better because it’s really deforming his arguments.
His solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people discussed what he really says rather than simply label him as irresponsible and put off the concerns of him and a large number of people left on account.
Yes thank you.
The vote was completely deformed.
The inutility of drawing a bulletin into a vote every 5 years is deeply annoying me because my vote really doesn’t count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and parliamentarians to report locally before their voters.
In addition, I conteste the idea that the statements of Russell Brand are not his (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics coming from the counter-cultures that Suzanne would like to group under the label “psycho-chomskysts”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Per that’s what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headaches added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It draws into a political speech that has existed for generations but has been marginalized by traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “front” mostly reveals to my eyes that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDVs of History where business historians have become minorities and where the exchanges of specialists have weakened to the benefit of prepared-to-thinking condensed types of Sciences Po for press records.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take it to a guilty, an emissary buck.
They develop both of the very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on those messengers who are the wave key to their thought.
I think rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This belongs to a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of relating to the other is resolved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or/liberal inclination (from both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek the aid of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes well.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a positioning against the three intellectuals quoted here.
And no support anyway.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you’ve probably read a chouya too quickly if you’ve taken Foucault’s texts about the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this way.
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty the accession mechanism represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether you agree with him or not, he is an original and respectful thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human scientists who don’t tolerate that we pass from loyalty to their mantras, is quite ridiculous.
Narcissism and authority of these people are unlimited.
One important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these “rebels”, which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellow” I’ve been witnessing in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn’t have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends on this topic, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russians could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don’t remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same as the White.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them holding violently anti-white words.
My father is not happy that his older daughter comes out with a White.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially over the past years: they are becoming more and more rich, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
Of what was told to me, the Russians have primarily prejudices against temporary unqualified workers from Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in professions and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the shores of the Yenissei River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of the Australians about the Chinese and Aboriginal.
It’s really strange that a stranger tells me I don’t tolerate the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (including one abroad), I didn’t keep bad memories of them, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very gentle that’s the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, everyone is worth, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what is strange?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And you always go out with this white.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
No, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these White Girls would attack them physically.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Nevertheless, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly marked leftist groups such as the syndicate of the magistrate.
@Marabout: Sorry, but the judicial media are frankly mark to right.
The Syndicate represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders the removal of two obstacles.
The one of the political vision of the observer as the one of the fact interpretation of the magistrat.
It remains the mandatory tool of the law to re-centrate the assessment on the foundations.
The measurement of its inobservance in all the judicial acts of the magistrate, including parquet, forces to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrate.
It would be vain to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
The claims and denials are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all of this is not analyzed, how can we then claim that justice is improving in France?
It is only by statistics that implicitly reveals that it goes very down.
The previous preamble allows to properly insert the following in the third ratio.
The Corruption of the Judiciary.
Subject sensitive in proportion to the power of disturbance which is conferred to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of the spoliation* of inheritors committed through fraud in proceedings* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives good year bad year 150 million euros while enjoying the coverage* assured by the case-impunity* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was in the comments following the first publication.
Where this accompanies that statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, during numerous disputes between the genealogist and the inheritors who refuse to be so spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all the laws favourable to the inheritors.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lies?
Prices are completely prohibited.
More equipment to cheat people with disabilities.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built according to his size and weight and that really allowed him to enjoy the outdoor as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires, could not.
As you say, the colors and the tastes.
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a Top Gear challenge.
The tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill has never had to clean a dog crot on a cranberry.
I’m sure my sister would love all-terrain tricycle, but it’s simply too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a pencil for the longboard.
There are mountains that you would like.
Prices seem really high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bicycle, so “you see.”
The triangle is useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available.
Only if they are disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know relevantly that they are needed for us.
We can’t really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it’s just an outbreak, it’s not planned to be manufactured.
I am CONTACT that the “long distance” wheelchair doesn’t come to the market, because apparently there’s no way to drive this fit truc.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense bombings of densely populated residential districts.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupational power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children lived all their lives under Israeli blockade.
A unique situation in the world, an inacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, as this blockade imposes a “collective penalty” on all Gaza civilians.
“The entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market.”
It’s not a wooden language, but a concrete and armed lady.
References are there to support a argument or fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels.
There is the black market that is certain, and recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an inacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time needed to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whoever you know) excluded him!
Don’t forget that after taking it up, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am a Western, so I agree...
by Jonathan...
The block is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you think well.
Couchsurfing is much more cool than Airbnb.
This is the definition of the economy of sharing, without a profit.
A lot of people are looking for just one night shock on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least hopefully) in a different way.
It’s always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and renters often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus avoiding Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What do you rent on?”
No problem with the word, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It’s an international newspaper now, in the case you’t have noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers the permission to practice a commercial activity (what they will definitely refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it’s really a nightmare...
Have you ever thought that ships can be moved, stolen and painted, flooded, etc.?

Marine Le Pen is not right.
The populism?
There is no other truth than that that reveals the facts.
Poverty is growing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be announced.
Capitalism will not become poor.
The high finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our foods so our food, with the care structures so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity of the money.
To prove the opposite, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of Economy a former Rothschild bank, a story of better defense of the interests of the banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there any other competent?
How do you call it: turn his jacket back, drop his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t know what Marine Le Pen is thinking about.
Where did you see that?
The Germans refused to help the survivors.
I’m not sure that Spee really “rejected” to help the survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee has quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British corrosion in the area.
The sea was hollow at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after the sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Battle of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being saved, you see a quiet and full-day sea.
Moreover, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn’t really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I made a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two caroused cruiseers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped the shooting, and a pursuit race began.
Leipzig sees something in fire, but as he approaches, he sees that it was just a spave.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and sees the Monmouth, pending and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors on the flag of the ship, the proposal to leave was rejected and he opened the fire, eventually flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee ruled that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 22:15.
Worried about reports indicating a British corrosion in the vicinity, he went to the north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, staying in the dark before the radar was invented, didn’t know that a ship had flooded, and therefore they couldn’t look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy square in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they deguarded to enjoy their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock’s sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised to the UMP to demand that it be enrolled in the law that a elected permanently condemned is therefore permanently inappropriate.
This is a brave position, which would also touch left-wing voters well on.
Noon, it’s a joke.
For this idea I propose an inscription to the wall of the councillors.
When is the prohibition of trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated?
It isined by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to get rid of those who will take advantage of their inamovability to hinder the actions of true politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small pancards" money for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they possess in the service of their party.
It’t defend the same theses if right-wing, or even extreme-right trade unions target the personalities of its edge and lead against them a legal-media war.
Your statements are completely free.
If, right now, the judiciary is deferring, it is simply that it has committed the facts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that had so much to do with Justice but all those who were subject to his attention did not have a treatment of favor.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the union of the magistrates which is of the left is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister supports the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The syndicate you quote may be a minority among the judges, but its influence is great on the Chancellor, it’s not a secret.
It is now questioned whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than teaching.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What do you complain of?
@Pivoine: You forget that the judges are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to put the accusation and to imprison everyone.

What if none of the participants would ever come back?
Welcome to Katie Waissel.
I think even the weakest hungry of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a pipe to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of albums or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision competition, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everyone else took part in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the britain television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into forgetting.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the competition.
Rarely are those who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can best expect three albums and one best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breats through his mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar freakers who smoke grass in their father’s garage and balancing three agreements on a poem level primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because sacralistic ethnologists present us these distant people as infinite superstitious and pets of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations everyday.
Unless you interpret it in the opposite way.
Or rather than saying that the tambour is without sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a slightly sacred character?
Our way is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and surrounding the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It is the deco ephemere to furnish the emptiness.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrated figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw the orties of no scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of disciplines to make us laugh a little?
For what is true for archaeology also applies to the interpretations that other disciplines give.
This would bring a dose of healthy humility.
Your contempt for the archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimony to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very ancient and earlier archaeologists trusted in their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Today we have such effective technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) controversy on the chamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (see his book "The Chamanes of the Prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this very instructive article.
Do men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get there.
Is it over between us?
I don’t really understand why we can’t continue to three?
This newspaper is thought to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we are not against a theatrical piece about that.
We could not watch a musical comedy about it, but it would be too gay!
We could expect this kind of comment from you.
Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, I can suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I’m sure you’ll feel more at home.
He prefers Mickey Mouse.
Can I suggest that we all were looking for a newspaper that paid true journalists, courageous, so that they write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of getting rid of these childhood joke.
Not very smart.
Then go out.
If these “children’s ass jokes” shock you so much, you’re not forced to participate, right?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the thing that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
You can find the amateur video of the crash on the net.
Amateur video of the crash on the net.
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers it would have gone out the safety because at the time or another vehicle (for example, a disruptor) would enter the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhon which we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider good to advance the time of departure (the right television, pub, money...).
It also protects the pilots.
Well, I also agree with this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM makes the SC enter, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English that led then...
You are here on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it’s not serious, I have a little time to find out all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There has been a lot of conspirations in F1, but never one that puts commissaries in danger of death for a long story of the possibility of one pilot’s victory at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that comes out of safety because it is the FIA.
The size of Nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image mostly enables the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner agits a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it’s not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one clearly sees one of the commissaries agitated a green flag, sign that the race can start again normally and that you’re more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark confusion of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime after the place of the accident, from where the green flag agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissioner’s position right below the accident (depending on the case, it may be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) turns the green to tell the pilots to return to a normal look.
The sensationalism makes the pub sell.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I am very afraid that, in the end, it’s just for money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the pub and the media are good to sell us things supposed to improve our sex life.
Information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to continue to scare people to be able to continue to control them.
“When the tabloids toss about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be “tossing,” not “tossing.”
Given the medical reference, “tough” is much better said in this context than “draw”.
I wonder if all the people who feel that Ebola could begin to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too much honour.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the upcoming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch.
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridiculously and solidly ridicules this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me laugh.
I’m depressed that the media talks about most of the things with this optimism on the reverse.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and angry enough (without getting to the hystery) for the government to get us off when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to suffer a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises he has invented himself.
Is there nothing fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it had to be horrible, given the context of the 1980-90s.
I am bluff, living with the certainty of going through it for years.
A very unnecessary testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only testimony serves nothing: taken isolately, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Witnesses cannot serve as scientific material.
Per that’s why we abstain from asking questions to psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric dossier mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her grandmother.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say that it is foolish, it is a subjective testimony without importance.
Oh, because the testimony of a fact (= here this testimony, which testifies of the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is not useful in a scientific approach?
What is your research based on?
About fantasies?
Do you put the phantastic theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verified testimony)?
“Resilience” is the crazy word adulated by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves as great psychologists after reading D’Ansembourg.
@Jim: There is a lot of empty buzzwords in psys.
Cyrulnik made us the “resilience” blow.
As this is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he has broken us a reliable scale of measurement to quantitise it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and Company ??
Do you remember Team America?
In fact, it’s not a good idea to get out of the air Sentinels.
And why then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us then leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But what will they do to keep the kids hanging?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pipi-caca genre humor, which would kill the series.
It was a series for children.
The children hang.
That’s because it’s a child series.
The UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
Keep your team America.
Always in supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you don’t see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I’m looking forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope that it will give the idea to a chain to re-send the old ones.
The series has almost never ceased to be broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years that we have an hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-class commercial channels and you can still see it at these schedules.
And the half-hour episodes are now at 5:30 p.m., from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “truly” 60 year old guy, but I don’t watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves a political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations under and around the mosque of the Esplanades for several decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The mountain of the temple, if there is, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque esplanade was built.
Its summit, or the rock dome, is climbed in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is the mountain of Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it’s good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately transmitted to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan in 2 states, and has sabored it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His people?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: “God be praised!”
To praise us with tourism in Israel, we are often shown to young naïades half-devised, walked on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as you can see on the photo that illustrates the article.
It makes me a little scared anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
It is a shame that the Reuters photographer has not taken a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who are allowed to go back to the Temple Mountains and who prefer to fall the faithful Jews down, praying at the Wall of complaints.
@Mat, If this photo annoys you, it’s right, it’s neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but that woman and the ideology she transmits that it must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to go out, large companies have greatly benefited from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they can’t afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave increasing wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it’s not durable, but it’s going to change in this country only when the workers will really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and shaking when someone else makes the strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike does not only concern their problems, but also show your employer that you don’t shake people impunely.
Unless we give up democracy, in any case, it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
That’s because we’re in democracy.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
This seems incredible, but this is exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Resolution Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have to our lives.
It’s just recently that we’re beginning to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated in your back.
Did Churchill not say “blood, sweat and tears”?
This is what makes great results, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak line will probably be the car market.
In the 18th century there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let that (in the end, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the wallet of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, shortly: the dissolution of the idea of the Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even if it becomes more and more uncomfortable...
You are still missing the syndicate of married men, celibaters, married women, celibaters, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don’t write the French correctly, I’m syndicating.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
For the defense of category interests, protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
It is praised not to laugh about the fear of the risk by an official.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise a disaster.
And with the charges that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What safety do you talk about?
Ignorance is...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the topic here commented...
Let’s remove “through its delegates” in article 8 of the preamble of the 1946 Constitution.
It will be: “8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of the working conditions as well as in the management of the enterprises.”
This is absolutely indispensable with the breakdown of the information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
The section was there, all empty.
I thought the conversation had to be started.
Anyway, it’s Joffrey’s wedding I’ve watched, and I can tell you that some have been well-seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in television history.
The cake mmmh.
The Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO.
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has made the genre “boum, here’s my cake butter now buck it and inclinate before your master!”
Per the additional pressure from friends and parents outside eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outside people were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always the next week” which disappears the last week.
I love cooking, but I don’t think I can do it.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a super entertainment and push us to try new things.
Go to GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to brick one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to separate, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could have found was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's moulin didn't give desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial due to the time spent.
There is also the cancer that looks, with the solar winds.
Everything succeeds right now.
It is a bad time for mankind, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of the remaining solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to “hide” the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancer.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm ourselves (less than infrared), to module our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morality.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a resident when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was understood in the commentary, which himself intends to show pedagogics.
Without saying that I am an accustomed to melanoma, UV only accelerate its development.
They do not provoke it.
For evidence: not all people with bronze necessarily have melanomas.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you should avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cave, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human being.
The excess, however, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanoma.
Can we pipe it?
And more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or pass it to the mixer.
I think the majority of those who are interested in it have found that everything can be folded if we apply enough strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as first-line communication hardware.
But for the others,
It remains a good choice.
The majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied to it.
This is a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already covered?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the playoff that I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we see wrong how it could return to it.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don’t know how they do these things.
But, will they put testing software on everyone?
Photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
The book is for Bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we’re surprised that the industrials produce in ‘industrial’ We put forward super u but all the teachings and the small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (medium wage in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear it.
Food is one of them.
Go without grief, I will kiss you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total reason-thought degradation.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes coming, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens don’t endure this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuphery so don’t be surprised to often encounter criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the related details (aircraft, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I can’t find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolls are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of Caviar?
And you are able to understand the concept of Boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists.
The boboecolo is part of it, but it is only the most visible branch of the ecos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She is so bad that she looks vague like a female naked.
Fall, you are next to the plate.
You need to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don’t have any legitimacy to comment as you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn’t know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous without having any artistic capacity.
That’s about the art.
It is a pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing billard.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for this, a camera will do the case.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it’s so easy, why don’t you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service.
L(honesty obliges to say that France decreases its staff, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more dramatically, starting with Britain.
It is half encouraging.
Operating without support, it quickly finds its limits.
A unique approach, at the time we observe the weaknesses, the insufficiency of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: that's what I said, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have met little or enough the military thing dare to come to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without laughing out...
Let us apply the same potion to the entire public service and the public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why Defense can consider itself a bit charged!
Well yes, the savings that everyone agrees to say that they must be done, it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls gems to the murder when it happens at their home, the poor dear.
It should be done but above all that it doesn’t fall on me because, in this case, it’s a crime and not an economy.
Guinness is going.
How will the closure of the Valley of Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, the story is repeated at every closure of post, maternity, hospital, caserne.
Everyone is for economies.
It’s bizarre, a UMP mayor who wants compensations and does not enjoy the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the worst thing I’ve ever read!
This shameful moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s the depression to make her Facebook line broke down and see that 80% of her friends started their statutes with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they will make a movie.
He will surely be based on funny scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus while going to work and only then realizes that his jacket is back in his jacket.
It’s not embarrassing, it’s completely con.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to hide his emotions and to stretch his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a struggle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the internet.
I don’t think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
I have to watch this movie before I die.
I can't believe how incredible this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just really demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I fall to the reverse.
It is absolutely necessary for me to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they can finally have the illumination and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that comes out of Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
God, it was really null.
Especially if they are neither women nor travestis.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until a new order we make ourselves confiscate the right to save our planet by states playing the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
We, citizens, decide to take things into our hands.
With the commissary they planted to energy, all these beautiful recommendations fled ....
Winds and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
It is all funded by the taxable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
The pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in case of accident.
As long as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit itself to the laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided that we naturally drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity by renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions in production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by wind renewable or PV is already more GES on the other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power by wind renewable or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I'm not insulting you I'm Doctor of State in Physics in 1981 Plus I've done research in nuclear physics I'm challenging you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it's you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and as all right people destroy the interlocutor I never do it.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany’s current renewable energy program is a non-profit and inefficient way to reduce GES emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you don’t count the uranium extraction and construction and if you don’t count the greenhouse gas water steam of any effect than the CO2 it is true reminds the two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water steam and a little into the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
For the last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It’s not surprising, most Indians who post comments want to read and make comments only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your state of mind.
What would have been the same if they qualified India as a giant of South Asia?
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just be opening a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafia.
As for ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletico imposed 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
In comparison with the billions and billions that India is devoting to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “lucky neighbors”...
The low cost race is paid cash.
Sorry for such a good project.
For the incident, the possible design defect manifests only with a too cold helium.
We may not be in a lack of design, but in implementation.
Unlike arianespace which is a private society, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same that here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they’re going to pay for the satellites in fregates who knows.
This is even more angry that many media regain the only articles titles - and that many readers retain only those titles.
In total, this creates an incorrect impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly question the project while it’s just a launching problem.
