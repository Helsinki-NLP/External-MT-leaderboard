Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain arrested the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was being held in Spain, was arrested by court order.
Yesterday, the court also took into custody three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Syndicate, aged between 27 and 57, who are primarily involved in drug offenses.
In the province of Malaga, Spain, an alleged leader of a criminal gang was arrested in Mijas.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is identified as a leader of a criminal gang and two as members of a criminal gang.
The data collected suggest that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The criminal gang's activities were aimed at committing drug offences and thereby generating criminal proceeds", commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the public eye before, and some of them have been convicted of drug offenses.
Verte stressed that cooperation with the Spanish colleagues was important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become a regular part of our business and this week's operation shows the success of our cooperation", said prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department, Ago Leis, said the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, we were able to work for a long time and arrest suspects in Estonia and Spain at the same time", he said.
Leis added that the Central Criminal Police officers were helpful in the detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will catch them from the other side of Europe", said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the suspects may continue to commit new crimes while at large, and the prosecution requested their arrest, which was approved by the court.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting extradition to Estonia.
The criminal case in question involves the seizure of property, vehicles and cash as security for confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and are led by the State Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court found Slava Gulevich guilty of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then supreme leader Nikolai Tarankov.
A native of Kemerovo, Gulevich rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly ceiling fee.
Joint international operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and enforced judgments confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, recent judgments separating eight defendants from the so-called Dikaev criminal group, from whom the proceeds of crime were confiscated at EUR 80 000, or the judgement against nine individuals that Igor Aleynikov had set up a criminal group in 2006 to carry out crimes related to the illicit trade in cigarettes and human trafficking in East-Virginia and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated proceeds from crime is almost 71 500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with their foreign colleagues on a daily basis and prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, conduct joint operations in any EU country.
A civil rights group is warning against travel to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28, 2017, urges all African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution while traveling throughout the state in light of a number of suspicious racial incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are being reported here".
According to the NAACP, the group's travel advisory was prompted by both a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination cases and the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by state law enforcement.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are marginalized because of their color, beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP's Missouri chapter, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints".
This is the first such warning issued by the organization to a U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist attacks on black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders of Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while driving across state lines and being taken into custody by Missouri State Police without being charged with a crime.
The note also refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The sign is designed to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers of what may happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether that means bringing bail or notifying relatives that they're crossing the state line".
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, which puts the state 16th in the nation for the number of hate crimes.
The travel advisory is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that mandated local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as the ACLU said it increases racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: What should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis viruses - hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
At a serious cost, chronic hepatitis B and C can progress to cirrhosis, or cirrhosis of the liver, and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiologist with the National Board of Health, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter symptom is also the origin of the colloquial name for hepatitis, jaundice.
Children may have hepatitis without symptoms.
The different types of hepatitis can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can progress to chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms, meaning that a person may not know about his dangerous liver disease.
The hearing aid will identify the different forms of hepatitis and describe their course.
Hepatitis A viruses are spread from a sick person to another person and are transmitted through eating or drinking contaminated food or water, through sex, through the excrement of an infected person on and from food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug use.
Those at risk of contracting hepatitis A include family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with infected people, men who have sex with men, drug users, travellers to countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and for people at risk of hepatitis A.
It is also important to observe daily hygiene requirements, such as washing or disinfecting hands, washing all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with the blood of an infected person, drug injections, tattoos, piercings, the use of blood-contaminated items (toothbrushes, shaving products), donor blood, sexual contact with a person with hepatitis and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn.
People at risk of contracting hepatitis B include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, emergency workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
Vaccination is recommended for people at risk, including those with chronic liver disease, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoidance of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and piercing, and use of condoms during contagious sex or avoidance of risky sexual behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, drug injections, tattoos, piercings, use of blood-contaminated objects, donor blood, sexual contact with a person with hepatitis and from a mother with hepatitis to a fetus/newborn.
Those at risk of contracting hepatitis C include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, emergency workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, people with HIV, and travelers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis C.
Prevention of hepatitis C is to avoid using foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using a condom during contagious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, by contaminated needles, by sexual contact and rarely by an infected mother to a fetus.
People at risk of hepatitis D are chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus and those who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective prevention is to vaccinate with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by the fecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including by eating lightly heat-treated meat, fish and shellfish, through donor blood, shared syringes and to foetuses from infected mothers.
Travellers can get infected in countries with high hepatitis E infection.
Prevention of hepatitis E includes hygiene: washing or disinfecting hands after using the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for a sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before eating, avoid eating a small amount of processed meat, fish, and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from using drugs.
Although the final lap was a struggle to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track, 34-year-old Farah found his strength and won in a time of 26.49.51.
Without thinking, Farah pulled her husband, Tania, and children onto the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
It was amazing to be on the track with them", Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the gold double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in his fifth consecutive title race in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite its title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold: Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, the Extraordinary Story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's Portrait" delves much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from the birth of a work of art.
But more in depth, history.
A more powerful ax, perhaps, would have been needed to provide the most impressive information, and a narrower subject would have allowed the title to give more impact to the extraordinary portrait.
Today, it would be as if two books were bound together: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold", by Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you into the bustling cultural life of Vienna, and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital can easily imagine what life was like in the Ringstrasse area more than a hundred years ago or how everyone in the Central Café was turned on their heads when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, and seeing a familiar name in a book makes you feel a little more cultured.
But the fact that Sigmund Freud was working in a city with an incurable syphilis epidemic and one of the highest suicide rates in Europe doesn't add anything to the story.
Or perhaps even so, every few lines of brushstrokes add color to the cultural life of early 20th-century Vienna.
Dreaming of a trip to the Soviet Union
By the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the turn of the century, about one in ten Viennese were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to open the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt's famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet was not drawn to the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "The Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna at the last minute.
The Klimt order cost 4,000 kroner at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house in a good location.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of being a love story model did not deter the sugar tycoon.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in gold.
The extraordinary story of the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, a masterpiece of Gustav Klimt", Varrak 2016, translated from the English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work with Adeleg began, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adeleg as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Golden Lady" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (in 1907-1908) another golden painting "The Kiss" was born.
The similarity between the two women has not gone unnoticed by art historians.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
"I think I owe it to my friend Klimt in memory to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had completed another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele died in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He left his jewelry to his nieces, Maria and Luisa.
A year after Klimt finished the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna but failed his drawing exam.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jews.
In any case, by 1939, the mission of the Austrian Gallery, as mentioned in Maria's will, had changed significantly - finding works that would appeal to the Nazi Party in Vienna's rich Jewish art collections had become important.
Hitler's personal art collection also included some works from Adele's home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art theft, a decade-long legal battle between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs began.
Just to be clear, if you're going to see The Kiss at the Belvedere in Vienna, you should see Adele Bloch-Bauer's The Lady in Gold at the New Gallery in New York.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book I mentioned earlier.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions after the book was closed were more about Nazi and Jewish themes than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but a family story, and a very moving one.
The Bauer family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book made it much easier to find your bearings.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada.
In the preliminaries, Gold was very close to his own 200m breaststroke personal best of 2.16.62.
The 17-year-old's best finish came a week ago when she clocked 2:16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, according to the Priit Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one to make it to the A-Final, maybe the tenth.
In the final, he ran the distance in a time of 2:15.76 and finished a respectable seventh with a new powerful record.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) was broken by Gold by just over half a second.
In the all-time leaderboard, Gold moved up to third and his recent personal best mark is Estonia's fifth all-time result.
The young prospect is yet to compete in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and the 200m and 400m medley at the Canadian Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there, too.
She won the 200m freestyle silver medal in a time of 2.03.22.
That's the fastest time an Estonian swam that distance in 2008.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Partõka has swum this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian, who lives in Canada, also won a bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with a personal best and a new Estonian season's best of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has swum that distance only a century faster.
She also reached her personal best in the 100 m backstroke with a time of 1.03.69 in the preliminary round.
She finished seventh in the half-marathon with a time of 2:17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season standings on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics are sharpening their teeth.
It's holiday time, which means a little bit of a break for US President Donald Trump.
But with Trump being one of the most holiday-loving presidents ever, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans a 17-day vacation at the quirky golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been talking about it for a week.
They're blaming Trump for taking too many days off.
The president spends his weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, Barack Obama for half that, just 21 days.
But Trump has a tendency to forget things quickly.
Days after he was inaugurated, Trump said on 60 Minutes that there would be no time for long vacations during his term because there was so much to do.
She also expressed her anger about Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president tweeted at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping off journalists' heads".
White House officials say a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly relaxation.
It's officially called a working holiday, during which Trump has no time to read or do any other leisure activities.
And there must have been another reason for the leave.
The air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House is being replaced, and all personnel have been evacuated.
The West Wing also houses the Oval Office and other presidential offices.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the West Wing in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning", said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to work during the holiday.
You can get a sense of where President Trump will be spending the next 17 days from the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew so much about bad media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start to dismiss him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken from us, and we may be led, silently and silently, like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who's gonna have to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted at least 450 posts from people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's office dismissed the lawsuit, and online comments were buzzing with "Who cares?" backlash.
"It's just Facebook", many said.
But it does.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
His approval rating is the second-best of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a rash-headed, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless, and not as much as you would like.
He has led the state with a firm hand and a firm grip on his principles.
He has also used Facebook as his primary means of communicating with his constituents, using it rather timidly, for example, to introduce his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
So blocking visitors to the Governor's Page, which is an officially-branded public forum run by staff paid for with taxpayer dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, saying that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls gossiping, spammer posting, or angry crowds.
The Post interviewed several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's what they are -- real people interacting with their elected leaders -- teachers, business owners and pastors, not Internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, was not inciting anger, but real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not reacted to the hate crimes or other recent news", she wrote in a comment section for The Post newsletter.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same issue, some people will immediately label it as a collective effort rather than acknowledging that it is a matter of concern to a large number of citizens".
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack" would likely be called "public support".
The Facebook era allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it used to be when you had to send employees out to do the same thing to collect critical headlines and burn them or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for tearing down Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked him from his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant court decisions on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the former chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal services had the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous correspondents challenged his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, overturning Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected as part of an online George Washington letter collection project, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his positions on the treaties of friendship, trade and navigation with Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And good leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty is counting on the comfort of his home turf at the Renaissance Club.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the comfort of his home turf over the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course.
The Northern Irishman, who was driving the Archerfield Links track nearby last year before being subdued by Paul Ealese on the final lap, is attached to the new venue and will replace the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad as the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see the club shine in its glory with this event", said Rafferty.
"The players see the track at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's a keen golfer and proud of what he's done here.
It makes for a great presentation of the track".
England's Eales is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, despite winning on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling", said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from my winning calendar a year later.
It's magic to be back in this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I'm reminded of last year, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win was special.
It was a very special time that will forever be in our hearts".
On home soil, Gary Orr will be back in action, having joined the Senior European Tour earlier this year when he turned 50.
This is his first event in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful", said Orr, a Helensburg man.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra-pink.
I've enjoyed playing the game immensely again and have shown a fairly decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going".
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots in the race, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold-Rich Country
When Bardina Dege cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He doesn't even use the pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarot, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife places a batata, known locally as a nota, directly over the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred mug is removed from the fire and diligently applied to the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a mud floor - he has no furniture - and there he also does his daily household chores, such as washing laundry with the mist water of a nearby pool.
The role of a spigot is played by a bucket in a room without a roof.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to tend any fields.
Polygamy is common in this country.
Working late can be dangerous, though - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five o'clock at night", he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the mountainous country of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by hand in front of occupying forces.
The movement, which had been pushing for the liberation of the region from Dutch rule, quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which still maintains its tight control over the region, keeping foreign journalists and human rights monitors at bay.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both a remote and a deserted place, a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabir, and then a nauseating five-hour drive by rented car.
There's no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs that have been rusted to various shades of yellowish-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the trip, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this kind of clothing", says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and light skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia, a gold-rich country.
Just 60 miles [100 km] from Panionia, a mountainous province of about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined approximately USD 3,1 billion worth of gold and copper from this area.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $78 billion worth of timber.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the popes, for they are the cause of the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 investigation by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military personnel and units approximately US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
The popes' efforts to secure greater autonomy threaten this golden egg and they are being treated mercilessly.
Human rights activists say that more than 500,000 papas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970's amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Birsbane, 'We are losing everything', contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (among which rape and electrocution are particularly common according to another report) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to quantify the number of victims because such incidents occur every week", says Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws are tightened even harder because Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family restaurants sell gado-gado, a stewed and mixed vegetable dish served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than local papayas in the traditional market", explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Panea, who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"The poppies of the population - the poppy mama-mama [women] - are losing their market share".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But very little has changed in Papúa and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for restoring justice", You says.
In fact, Paniai was struggling with low self-esteem just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing a Christmas carol around a campfire in Enarotari when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle in the dark.
The kids who were in the car told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses say drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Election Commission building was set on fire, and the next day, things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women, and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting costumes and performed the Papua mee pago, a waita dance, in which the birds sang and ran in circles.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
"If the crowd shows more than three times the amount of resistance, shoot them", said an official document seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media.
Jeremías Kayame, 56, of Kego Koto, a town in Enarot, sensed the imminent danger and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one was willing to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine in his brightly colored wooden porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"The people were many, let the multitude answer", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to a cousin who witnessed him being shot.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw her dead... I kissed her".
Papuan police chief Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only ensuring the safety of their precinct because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when we are threatened with death", said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua New Guinea Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapuras expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want this case solved now so it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address the human rights violations committed.
But almost immediately, an apology followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes", he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be settled by law".
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes have already been solved in Papua, including in Panya.
The families of the victims of Paniai took such claims with disbelief.
"I have been questioned four times in the past three years, but no progress has been made", said Yohan.
"I'm tired of it".
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid to unravel this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after helping bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighborhood of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a dispute broke out between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to a hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company office.
Police say villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a panic, afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured coming in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The Deiyai Parliament has demanded that the police officers involved be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of planned development is fueling discontent among the honey, moni, dan, and damali tribes of the rugged central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papal Movement (VPL), a rebel army that claims to defend papal rights by staging random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders are from Panya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai over the past years under the pretext of 'protecting the sovereignty of the state'.
Some of them never show up.
Among the Papuan people, Panei is known as "a tragically forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of their catch for the family, selling the rest at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between the indigenous Papas and the new migrants has widened, which have arrived in large numbers since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The papas themselves often lack the capital or skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the world's eyes off the Pope.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "failing to observe proper practices" despite being granted a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists trying to cover the most volatile eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua in Indonesia face new threats - visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of a pressing eye means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting at Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights abuses".
The locals want more attention from foreign governments.
When a Dutch official delegation led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, according to a source who attended the meeting but asked to remain anonymous, pleading: "We want freedom".
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai", says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to understand that in addition to the constant threat of a predatory army, the people of Panai are suffering from poverty due to poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other popes, owe their vote to Jokowi, who must pay.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting managed to cope with one last symbolic counterattack - they buried the body of one victim in the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they at least do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed", says Yacobus, his head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire swallowed Dubai Torch skyscraper for second time
A fire broke out Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter, 79-story structure.
This is the second fire to ravage a high-rise building, which is casually called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no immediate cause of the fire was provided.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who identified himself as George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Protection officials, firefighters extinguished the fire at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they're working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings worldwide.
The Commission also found that the construction of the new building was not in line with the requirements of the Restructuring Communication.
British police say they believe the insulation and panelling of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be big sellers in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a golden time for tech buffs, as phone companies release their new high-end models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium went on sale in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to hit the shelves in the fall.
According to Kristjan Seema, Marketing and Sales Director at Tele2, the flagship of the company is characterised by an innovative design, a blink-eye scanner, a 4K screen from edge to edge and a super-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has generated great excitement in the world of technology, and has also reached the top of the sales chart of Estonian smartphones.
Autumn offers even more speed charging, a more durable battery, a better camera and greater water and dust resistance.
It added that the rumors already allow for assumptions and predictions of four top models that are likely to dominate the sales charts this year.
These four high-end smartphones will hit the shelves this fall.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should hit stores as early as mid-September.
But rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what it can do are spreading.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences over the iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth anniversary is expected to see the new model completely different from its predecessors.
There are four colors mentioned: black, white, pink gold, and chrome.
One of the new design elements is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is missing, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's head of design, Jonilve, insists that the new iPhone model should look like smooth glass.
There's also talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-catching scanner, wireless charging and an even better camera, expect a faster A11 processor.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
It is reportedly even more business-oriented and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wavelength angle and the other with a narrower field of view telephoto lens.
No one knows what the dual rear camera is capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first experiment, and it's certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
But we're anxiously awaiting August 23.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, it is still missing its flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We expect a 5.3-inch screen that extends from end to end and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia is also mentioned for its aluminium body and its significant water and dust resistance rating IP68.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia has two rear cameras, with optics made by Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're expecting a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with an equally good or better camera.
Speculation about the new Sony model is that it will have a screen at least six inches.
We'll see what reality brings in a moment, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its fall flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which runs from September 1 to 6 this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump was pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has published transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop him from publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president broke the wall with him over public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press".
Trump built his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous", "crazy" and "stupid". He claimed that the deal made during the Obama administration would make him look like a "chef" because he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Court of Justice did not consider the complaint by OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the bus service from July 2019 to 2029.
The order refused the bid of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid at the bus interchange in Tartu because the bid did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Administration's Legal Service.
The procurement is for the public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Linit appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it up.
While many complain on social media that the noisy weekend festival is disturbing their nightlife and that the city is full of drunken revelers, there are many who have nothing bad to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the party people at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any disgust or disrespect.
I even saw kindness", says the monkey wave.
"It's nice to come and be and enjoy the Pärn, which has been like a winter's sleep in the winter", he adds cheerfully.
The foggy wave from the beach doesn't disturb sleep.
If living in the city center he could hear music playing on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his walls.
"But I hope I hear", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to the evening paper, says that the festival is good for Pärnu - it helps the local merchants.
He is also happy that so many foreigners have come to the summer capital.
The party noise doesn't bother the woman.
I'm not spending much time at the beach, but it's nice to see the beach come alive.
And it's nice to see people moving, and this is the third time", says the woman.
I think the first time was a little bit worse.
"Maybe there were complaints", he thinks.
But he says that the noise on the beach is normal for summer residents.
"This weekend is a great promotion for our little town", says Harry, a park freak.
The noise and the noise has not disturbed his rhythm.
But why?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interracial communication could be better.
Loud music doesn't break a man.
It doesn't matter that I live nearby.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble", he says.
He says the guests in the barn are polite.
"They've gone a little overboard with the bottles, of course, but the young are young and, my God, go ahead, but be human and we can do it!"
By then, the coastal inhabitants have traveled far away, perhaps to visit relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise", says Tiina, who walked the children in Pärnus.
Nor does the music of the festival disturb the sleep of his family, although last year it went even further than this.
Last summer, we were on the other side of the stage, so we heard more.
We live outside the city, so it's actually pretty good there, far away by the Pärnu river", she says.
Pearson is cutting 3,000 more jobs and cutting dividends to revive business.
Pearson, a British education company, said on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the threat of a business crash.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties on the measures in question.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in spending under a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its expectations for the year had not changed after reporting a 1% increase in sales revenue to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

At night, the weather in Estonia will be cloudy with clear skies.
It's raining in several places, maybe thunder.
Winds from the south and west are 5 to 11, with gusts up to 14 on the islands and coastline, up to 18m/s.
The temperature is 13 to 17 degrees.
It's going to be cloudy and cloudy.
It's raining in some places, lightning is possible.
The south wind is 6 to 12, the winds up to 15, the islands and the coast up to 20 m/s.

Conveyor attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and a translator were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabag district of the city.
The bombing is the latest in a wave of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion was caused by a joint patrol with the Afghan army being attacked with a "man-made explosive device".
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents said the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious concern for NATO forces in Karabakh.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including about 20% in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's predominantly Shiite district.
The Taliban say they were behind the attack.
A major bombing in the city centre on May 31 killed more than 150 people - the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
Correspondents said that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politicians and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reversed the decision to stay the injunction after appeals.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reversed its decision to delay the implementation of an Obama administration regulation that requires states to limit greenhouse gas emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over its actions.
The EPA announced its decision to resume "the 2015 ozone determination activities" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe we need to engage and listen to our state partners", said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intended to delay ozone levels - measuring soil pollution in different parts of the country to determine where levels should be reduced to meet the highest air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states filed suit Tuesday, along with the District of Columbia, claiming the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been trying to roll back several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader plan to market economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked a backlash among democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that breathing in ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase the risk of respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
The German pigs might have a party.
Germany's pigs and cattle may be having a feast as heavy rains threaten the crops of the EU's second-largest wheat producer, reports Bloomberg.
This year, weeks of drought before harvest may mean that crops destined for the baking industry are only fit for animal feed.
'The quality of the sludge is far worse than the sludge and worse than in 2015,' said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, double the usual amount, according to the AGRAV forecast.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by a haze that continued into August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is preventing harvests.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet begun harvesting, said local harvest collector Ceravis.
"These are some tough days", said Frank Deckert, a senior retailer in Ceravise, Rendsburg.
Harmony in Everything or the Clever Swings of Finnish Interior Design
Beautiful nature plays a part in the interiors of brass houses, as the large windows give a wonderful view of the Saimaa coastline to many (living) rooms.
At every step, we see our northern neighbors striving to create both rugged and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The Finns are admirable and worthy of respect for their skill in using wood as a building material, as a finishing material, and as a furniture and beauty product.
The exhibition halls offer stimulating ideas and clever solutions for both builders and home designers.
It is evident that combinations of black, white, and gray shades, when complemented by wood and plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair runs through August 13.
The utensils and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is a frequent cooking area.
Tonight, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival Balticule, and Martin Garrix did his best to be remembered as the last performer on stage.
The crowd was really turned around during Garrix's performance - singing, howling, dancing to the beat of the drum.
When Garrix finished, the mass of light was scattered from Pärnu Beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery of all the photos our photographer took over the weekend.
I'm sure you're one of them. Find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible confrontation.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are on a collision course to face off in the upcoming most exciting boxing match in the under-20 weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization light heavyweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over four-time world champion Adrian Bronner on Saturday's Showtime, both fighters are at the top of the weight class.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "a perfect fit".
"I'm a former heavyweight", Garcia recalled.
"I've gained weight for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm only 20 pounds short.
I want to move down the aisle.
And he's got to move up the lightweight and then we can fight.
The fans have asked for it.
Let's offer them that".
Lomchenko has agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight".
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be worth watching, part of his strategy to get Lomachenko to debut in the 61.2kg class later this year to make it possible to face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match after their lightweight title round at the Forum on September 23.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding because the fans have wanted this confrontation", Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offered the best money package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name can get as much attention.
Whenever they're ready"...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "strong fighter" and can go to his game on Saturday.
Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show off the punching power and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them to try to gain power.
"It's a struggle waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation has generated as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it", Garcia said.
Lomchenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
This is going to be a good fight".
What are the world's places of origin for immigrants?
The Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) in Mullu extended and issued a record number of over 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals, mainly travelling to Estonia for work, study or to visit family.
For example, when it was decided last year to issue temporary residence permits to 6,702 foreigners, the number was 4,928 in the past year.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
If ten years ago about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, in recent years this number is approaching 2,000.
The number of residence permit applicants increased sharply during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 people receiving temporary residence permits in 2014, compared to 675 the previous year.
According to the Statistics Office, Estonia is the country with the highest number of Ukrainian citizens - 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and, due to the difficult conditions in the country, it is natural that people seek work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many families are already ahead", said Interior Ministry spokesman Kristin Rammus.
The number of Ukrainians granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the latter have been granted the most temporary residence permits in the last ten years.
If Ukrainians come here mainly to work, then Russian citizens come here for family emigration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the strongest family ties to people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens with Estonian residence permits have moved, then Harjumaa is just behind Ida-Virumaa", he added, noting that about 40 percent of them are married to an EU citizen.
Mullu has granted temporary residence permits to 1,696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking to renew their residence permits decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of renewing the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for to settle permanently in Estonia", explained the Interior Ministry spokesman Rammus, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived in Estonia for at least three years in the previous year can apply for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia.
It's designed to encourage people to stay.
However, for long-term residents, the residence permit is for five years.
The new residence permit has probably also reduced the number of renewals of the old one.
For example, 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years were recently granted such residence permits.
Now Ukrainians can switch jobs and the Estonian state no longer has to keep track of whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular immediately, with applicants still being grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 persons were granted residence permits for the purpose of settling in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese.
By the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1,269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, when three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, there were 200.
Nigerians come to study here.
Furthermore, Estonian higher education institutions are popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens from India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely because of education.
The rule also applies to them: where a community has emerged, others will come more easily", Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, and the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6000 third-country nationals obtain a residence permit per year, this represents about 0,46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you add EU citizens, migration remains at around 1%", Maasing commented, saying that the actual numbers are small.
According to the Statistics Office, a total of 14,822 people emigrated to Estonia in the past year, while 13,792 people left.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration in the second year.
Most of the immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the departing ones.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was down by 2000 people.
Estonians mainly migrate between Finland and Estonia.
The princess fashion of Mammu Couture is charming with its satin, lace and spandex
For Maria Tammeoru, however, the unfounded idea is history - old paintings and costumes: "I could dream for hours in a museum and admire the old-fashioned arms and collars.
If you do something with passion, you explore and learn about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer doesn't.
You decide how much glow you have in your life!
I have a friend who has a sauna full of haute couture dresses I designed.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and walk the red carpet every day, she also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can live your own life!
A fashion artist doesn't know the difference between a bright event and a gray day.
It was this attitude that prompted the plan to bring high fashion to the countryside, to the forests and fields of Estonia, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
Mammu's collection was presented at the fashion show in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu, where the royal parade with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere, there's more emotion - shouting "bravo", standing up, wanting to shake your hand.
Most of the audience just came to refresh themselves, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like the feeling of being on a summer tour with my fashion line.
We had a 50-meter-long red carpet in the hallway, and the street was filled with beautiful dresses that seemed to go on forever!
Maria doesn't see it as fashionable to have a supermodel present her work to a supermodel. She likes to bring ordinary women on stage.
I often invite my clients onstage - they've always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I never saw my own show, I'm always backstage, giving things the last push as a hopeless perfectionist.
I'm nervous enough to watch from the hall.
Maria is the kind of designer who doesn't just want to be a model, she wants to be in control.
I have my sewing machine in my studio, and I do most of the sewing myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not just design, it's also styling, logistics, organization, organization, everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
I guess these fanatics are gonna be working a lot of hours.
I can't tell when my work day ends, it's just a day of joy for me!
I've been very lucky - it's like a never-ending chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, the person gets something beautiful and then compliments.
I've heard it said many times that my dresses have magic - they make me feel like a princess.
The full-length, boring satirical routines that made Maria's talent famous overnight remain Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the Estonian undergroup tournament weapon was now turned against us
I'm sorry, the fairy tale is over.
The first thing that came to my attention was that we couldn't get our table.
And when such a big gap comes into the table, there is nothing to do", commented on the 61:75 loss to Great Britain by the Estonian U18 basketball boys, our only basketball player to play in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls off the board and got so many more attacks.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, either.
Many of the English attacks were stopped in three to five seconds, we couldn't build up a defense.
But in defense, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It was a disappointment to the team.
The other guys had their homework done better.
In Müürsepa's opinion, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to slow down the opponents' momentum.
In the last quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents had already taken a few quick baskets.
Athleticism and aggression, which were our weapons in the junior tournament, now turned against us.
We didn't have the strength to fight their aggression today.
The mason made peace with his ward, Caleb, Matthias Tas.
The tournament generally has good things to say about the whole team, and so far there's been one single hitter.
It's a shame you've never faced an opponent so aggressive before.
The cup has always been confident and has played its part, but it seemed to be tired - it has carried a heavy load.
But he made some very nice moves that I have seen in training before", added the instructor.
Terrible numbers: the girls' basketball team scored 10 points in the championship game by three-quarters...
The U18s are not the only ones to play the EMI B Division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started their senior year in Dublin.
And the Estonian game against Poland, unfortunately, was in the anti-record zone.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter, the score was 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and the period was 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored four, one point in the third...
The Estonians hit two of the first four shots in the first two minutes, then 25 shots, then one three-pointer, then 21 more shots...
Maybe in about half an hour, one of the 47 shots was taken.
Plus, he got two points on four free throws.
The number of balls lost was a reasonable number in those days, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland's throwing percentage was 33 and Estonia's 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, Portugal had to concede an 83:56 lead on opening day.
NATO ships have come to Tallinn to replenish their supplies.
Today, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Action Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit over the weekend to replenish the ships and prepare for upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to sea, giving the crew a few days' rest.
Following the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and prepare for future historic explosion search operations.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the joint training they conduct in local waters is a good indication of our integration with the Allied forces", said Maj. Arto Reinmaa, acting Commander, Operations and Planning Division, Navy Chief.
As of 29 June, NATO's 1st Permanent Anti-Mine Group is commanded by Latvian Navy Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the command of the group from Estonian Navy Officer Captain Johan-Elias Seljamä.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also houses the group's headquarters.
This semester, the international unit will also include the Estonian Navy's mine hunter Sakala.
One of four groups of ships under NATO's Maritime Command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Action Group is a first-line rapid reaction force that the Alliance can deploy to various locations around the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become the site of the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klasi.
According to Risto Joost, Artistic Director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, (36), this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audience will be greeted by classics from the world of opera, such as Traviata and Tosca, ballet adaptations of the enchanting Bolero and the amusing Karlsson, and a planned production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio The Years, by the same international creative team that brought Pirital Haydn's second masterpiece, The Creation, to the stage in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose spell takes over and never really lets go.
Because the experience the listener experiences in this upper and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the Maestro Special Class shoes seem a little too big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Class, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and supported me in my early conducting career.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it all transfers to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What would you like to excite the audience at this year's festival, what special offer do you have?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet, written by Astrid Lindgren.
That's what Karlsson Flies is for.
And one curious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
He's probably had the Carlson personality in him since he was a kid.
Risto, how do you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of it.
And I've found that my personal emotions are not so much about other people as they are about myself, maybe how I deal with each new day.
And that kind of conscious tone, positive attitude, actually smiling at myself in the mirror every morning, really increased my happiness rate.
Especially this week, when the most important rehearsals are, I've been practicing this extra hard, and it's working.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises your mood.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer, but we're all just slowly discovering them.
Right now, right now, this is a big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor's chair?
Yes, I do. I'll have to change clothes for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment of my own.
But generally, yeah, I don't get a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I like to actively interact with people, even before I step on the conducting stand.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for even a not-so-great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the hilarious video with Risto Rost!
New results of Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers
In Sweden, a test was conducted to medically assess the age of asylum seekers using a novel approach.The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were over 18, but not all are convinced of the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to provide a more accurate age assessment for asylum applications after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly age a number of allegedly underage refugees.
The Migrationsverket has so far sent 6880 cases for testing and the Forensic Institute has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests are only used if the person's age is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as being older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there is evidence that the person being tested is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases the person had directly stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints and then allowing them to be examined by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some quarters.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they have passed puberty earlier or later than normal.
'I have had reason to think about this and I do not think the current measurement should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of a child being misdiagnosed as an adult is low.
The risk is highest, perhaps at about 10 percent, if the person is just under 18".

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Championships, finishing a respectable 18th place with a mark of 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female left-hander in the World Cup, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80), I immediately did my average, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear", Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my scum, and I'm very happy I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli's debut in the World Championship finished a respectable 18th.
The rain didn't bother O'Reilly, because he's training at TTÜ Stadium all winter.
"I'm hardened", he said with a little muff.
With the London Olympic Stadium almost full of people, did Orel sense the people around him or was he able to shut himself off?
I get it, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it adds up.
You can experience it when you're in the race.
Orel confirmed that he is comfortable with his MMI debut and that he will have many more good races ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, finishing 18th.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and the World Cup is all that matters.
I'm taking good experience with me and one day I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night in a meeting with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked out on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today I tell you, after much prayer and thought... "Today I tell you, the people of West Virginia,
The assembly erupted in cheerful shouts.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow", Justice added.
"As coach, I'd say it's time to play another game".
Trump had promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that "Gov. Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better than work for it".
"Out of just 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history, the Governor Justice announcement is simply the latest resignation for a party that is led from the bottom up and unable to find a positive and unifying message", RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
No wonder there are many people with many wounded.
Urmet, who was in charge of the medical team over the weekend, told the Evening Standard yesterday that they had to give out quite a lot of patches.
The furrows and the grooves are basic, the curves and the easy falls.
And, of course, headaches, back and leg pains.
Urmet says visitors come to the festival in the wrong shoes and that's what causes problems.
Paramedics have also had to treat a few more critically injured visitors - a few panic attacks and a broken leg.
We also stitched up when someone broke a hand or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the solemn paramedics ask for a painkiller to treat the hangover.
Coe praised the Russians for their honest apology for the doping scandal.
International athletics champion Sebastian Coe praised what he called "Russia's honest apology Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country's ban was correct and that he had a clear goal in fighting doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who have been stripped of gold and silver medals in the competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself admitted that they had had quite difficult times and they will do everything possible to reorganize the Union".
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the task force's proposal that now is not the time to take back Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can over the next few months to get things back to normal.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a corrupt system,' he added.
Eleven Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics starting Friday in London.
IAAF working group leader Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still does not meet several criteria for restoration.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still free to operate.
The electric car revolution will dramatically change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they're winning in one place and losing in another, it doesn't help smaller mining companies.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase.
This year, the stakes for the spread of electric cars have been raised by the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway to ban the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles for decades to come.
That's why Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars will outsell petrol-powered cars within two decades.
"For some metals, this is a game changer", said Simona Gambranini, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics, to Bloomberg.
We've already seen the big impact of metals like cobalt and lithium, which have been in demand for years.
Electric cars contain about three times as much copper as a conventional car, Glencore reported.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the exact amount of the aid.
The increase in demand for batteries for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars, from the rise in copper prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group forecast.
According to this brokerage firm, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
The London Metal Exchange has risen by 70 percent this year.
The price surge was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen 14 percent this year, largely because of economic growth.
Glencore's share price in London rose 20 percent, having outperformed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in terms of price.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who must adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries for powering the starters of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars run on lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another use is found to offset the drop in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of metals market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effects of the loose-roller trend are not yet apparent in the form of fluctuations in the price of lead.
Lead has risen in price by 17 percent this year, making it the most expensive of London's major industrial metals.
Investors see problems with the metal far in the future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps the cars competitive", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal brokerage Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead drops, it's slow.
Maybe it'll be like this in about ten years.
Meanwhile, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-acid batteries for frequent engine starts, is rising, says the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel because lighter cars can go further with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum aluminium requirement of 1,6 million tonnes already for the period 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world's total aluminium production.
Widmer said that this trend is likely to continue.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as increasing demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
The steelworkers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to make supercar bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also working to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminium minimum.
'Super-strength steel should be the answer to this development,' said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
Europe is seeing some success.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to platinum.
About half of this precious metal was used to catalyze diesel-powered cars, reported Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
"Many of the commodities that are in high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
The platinum producers believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars will continue.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, hybrid vehicles will continue to outsell all-electric cars.
The platinum producers' great hope in the 10-year perspective is in hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motor, which rely on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars", said Exane Brunet of BNP Paribas.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July when a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the home towns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules designed to prevent excessive spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League, will be with Paris Saint-Germain.
The Commission notes that the transfer of Neymar to PSG was not made without the financial support of the club.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG can no doubt spend that kind of money to sign Neymar and add him to their star-studded roster, given that the team is funded by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that go into debt in search of success are in fact engaged in fraud and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners withdraw their support.
The Commission notes that the FFP has not yet been able to provide any information on the financial situation of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potential club and then making large expenditures to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
And despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing overspending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future", Andrea Traverso, UEFA FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the transfer pricing of the assets of the two clubs was based on the market price of the assets.
The Commission notes that the transfer pricing of the assets of the two companies was based on the market price of EUR [50-55] million.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were subject to the heaviest penalties.
The Commission also notes that the French authorities have not provided any information on the amount of the aid.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to defraud the regulatory financial authorities by blowing up their revenues through companies linked to the club owners.
The Commission notes that the Qatari authorities have not provided any information on the financial situation of the company.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted in the form of a public contribution from the State to the airport.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG services may come from payments to the 2022 FIFA World Cup organising committee from Qatar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could be a World Cup winner, claiming that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The previous penalties imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant against any attempts to break the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any information on the financial situation of the club.
The figures for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, trades and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30% in connection with the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the country", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG being mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports giant, shares La Liga's view that the state funds the club.
"It's a property right and it's completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because the state may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the country".
Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting pictures on the plane of people who have pushed the boundaries of their field and inspired others, says trip.ee
As Norway's geography of operations has expanded, so has the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane.
Among the selected individuals are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured), and Miguel de Cervantes.
But soon, one of the planes will be decorated with a portrait of legendary Queen singer Freddie Mercury.
50 years ago today, a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia tore roofs and windows off houses.
The storm of the century, which struck on August 6 and 7, caused widespread damage, particularly in the Western Netherlands, Harlem and Rapland.
In northwestern Estonia, winds exceeded 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one sloping tree to another in the garden, trying to hold them with his hands.
It was dark and cracked like the end of the world.
In Taam, the roofs were already flying off the houses, remembered Linda Kurova from Haapsalus in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
Linda's husband saw his garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do with wooden hands, holding up against a storm like this?
The sea came through the window, water splashed in from the windows", said Linda, who lived on Haapsalus Kalda Street at the time.
Linda did not see the trees on the road and the roof of the train station's carriage house flying 20 to 30 meters away until the next morning, when she saw what most of the other passengers had seen.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa, the trees were lying in the forest, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm was raging through the beautiful old trees like a war.
Western Virumaa was less affected by the August 1967 storm than Western Estonia, but the damage was still considerable, wrote Virumaa Teataja in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were razed, but our parks also suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 115 feet [35 m] per second, or about 80 miles [130 km] per hour, were recorded.
On the evening of August 6, a little girl called out at the Marina Square in Tallinn: "Mommy, Mommy!
The chicken is in the air and cannot come down!"'
The building of the Pólli mansion on the farm was so badly damaged during the storm that it was later decided to demolish it.
The structures of the ski slope of Tyre, which were not rebuilt after the storm, did not survive.
The newspaper Red Star of August 12, 1967, reported that the clearing of fallen trees and branches in cities and settlements was progressing slowly, and residents could help.
The storm also hit crops hard, and the newspaper reported that "the Party-based organizations must be the instigators and guides of both the reorganization and harvest".
Hurricanes are defined as those with average wind speeds above 32.7 m/s.
The record for strong winds in Estonia dates back to November 2, 1969, when wind speeds of 48 m/s were recorded in Ruhnu.
On the island of Enindloo, a gauge broke, so the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret to clean beaches: cleaning at night and bad weather
The colder summers also mean less cleaning effort on Tallinn's diving beaches.
"If there is no rain, there are people on the beach, and if there is no rain, there are no people", says a beach cleaner.
Kayaks are screaming on the beach of Ström in northern Tallinn.
They are offered melodic competition by a low-speed landing tractor that pulls the strip down onto the beach.
In fact, the last one filters through the sand from a depth of seven centimeters, picking up sea litter and human debris - bottle caps, cigarette butts, and so forth.
People come to the beach whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and when it's not, there are no people", says Aleksandr Usov, director of beach cleaning at the Haberst Administration.
It's 6:30 a.m. and the beach is a bit of a cleanup because at 8:00 a.m. the beach needs to be clear for people.
Faithful is at work at 4:00.
Besides Ström, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and the beach of Pikaari on the Baltic Sea.
The garbage volume has decreased.
Years ago, there were many more.
People are already appreciative of what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that if you put something new up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're saving what's on the beach.
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian beaches is to clean up the sea debris that washes up on the shore.
For example, Pirita Beach has to transport 400,000 tonnes during the beach season.
"It is an incredible amount", notes Usov.
The second major category is trash, or all that people leave behind.
On the 1.5 kilometer (1.5 mi) stretch of the Ström beach, there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage.
However, colder summers have meant that garbage is one fifth less than usual.
The third category is abandoned property.
Mostly they're children's toys.
As a target this time, Usov has scooped up a dozen model cars from the sand.
They'll be waiting for their owners on the trees that line the beach.
"Usually more come out, but this is a normal catch". The believer already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take their toys and then they sink them back into the sand.
The garbage is being dispersed
Erika Scholler, a representative of the Haberst administration, admits that the tractor's screening work is disturbing the local population.
The noise, which lasts from late at night until the early morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
But in the daytime, it's impossible.
We'll have to sweep the beach twice in a month.
"If we don't, the city will fine us", says Scholler.
However, the aim is to get the Ström beach under the international blue flag quality label, as with Pirita, Pikaari and Pärnu.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work to be done in Estonia to maintain the beaches", says Scholler.
We have more gravel and rocks and harder sand to sift.
But we have less trash on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing rumors of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroomi, spontaneously enters the conversation with the reporter and the cleaners, highlighting the current shortages on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is birds and bottle-choppers who have been dragging garbage bags by hand", reports Martin.
Although it is hard to imagine that people will be able to change their habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the bins, such as putting covers on them to prevent at least the birds from exploring.
However, overall, Martin is satisfied with the development of Ström Beach.
I can see the city's taking care of it.
With playgrounds, lighted streets, and newly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
"Once, there was only one way to go on roller skates", says Martin.
Treasure hunter finds in the Strait: coins, only coins
The morning's cool weather has been taken advantage of by Dimitri, 40, who is a treasure hunter who uses a metal detector to comb the beach.
He doesn't think he'll find anything of value today or in the future.
The Sea Gods are not generous enough.
"I have been doing this for a year and have not found anything of value", says Dmitri.
As a hobbyist, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps, and dangerous nails in his treasure chest, which he later throws in the trash.
Usually there's coins.
"Gold, rings, and such things are not usually available", says the treasure hunter.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their current levels as weak growth and declining inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain stagnant as sluggish household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a hike this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the hike.
The Bank also noted that the Bank's inflation forecast for the first half of 2017 was lower than the forecast for the first half of 2018.
The Bank also noted that the increase in rates is necessary to contain Brexit inflation over the next few years and that financial markets may need to see higher than expected increases in borrowing costs.
MEPs also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus package launched a year ago following Brexit.
The Bank will end its term loan scheme in February, which provides low-cost financing to banks, although it said it now expects a £15 billion increase in the scheme, which is £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank states: 'The average MPC forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to affect consumption.'
The Commission's assessment of the impact of the measures on the level of the deficit was based on the following assumptions:
The stock market is currently forecasting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's revised growth forecasts for this and the following year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The forecast for 2018 growth of 1,8% was maintained.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 USD and by 0.4% to 1.11 EUR.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have dampened growing expectations for growth, with GDP increasing from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up a bit of momentum towards the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for rejoicing to households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying that things would get a little worse before they got better.
It added that monetary policy would not prevent a shock to incomes over the next few years, but that a significant recovery in wages was expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also stimulates the economy by increasing demand for British products, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were raised to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to plummet.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully come to life.
Prior to the Bank's last decision, there was growing demand for a rate increase, as inflation had increased pressure on struggling households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate increase to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Coreco's mortgage broker Andrew Montlake said: 'In light of the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year on a positive note.
The stock market seems particularly attractive to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.'
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a Supreme Court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England has announced that the NHS is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people, in an initial three-year clinical trial, a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is given before sex and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people of around 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens hailed the move, announced on Thursday, as "a new large-scale intervention", while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "tipping point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register, with more clinics to be added in October before the programme is rolled out across England by April 2018.
PrEP is a course of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people with a high rate of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that you have a sufficient amount of certain medicines in your body to prevent you from getting HIV.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sexual intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-infected and not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international procurement.
The aim of a clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about who the drug is intended for and how it is used and administered in the big picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and reinforce the broad and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of mankind's greatest health problems".
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, has the potential to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial, which is self-managed and does not depend on a partner to negotiate, improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly rolled out nationwide and that no person at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that we have a clinical trial drug for PrEP, we're on our way to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, assistant secretary of public health, said: "The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and government drag.
The evidence shows how much this drug can change the way HIV is prevented and the way this life-altering infection is stopped.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society".
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity on the day after the stock exchange between the price zones of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock market price for electricity last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour, rising by 12% compared with June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% from EUR 36,27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the Nord Pole system price was EUR 26,37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 percent of the electricity was supplied in the direction of Estonia and 16 percent of the electricity was supplied from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours were spent without next-day transactions between the two countries.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity was used from Estonia to Latvia 99% of the time and full transmission capacity was used 73% of the time.
According to the transactions on the last trading day of July, the price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX may be around EUR 34 per megawatt hour in August and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September.
The price of CO2 affecting electricity production rose last month and transactions were priced between EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
The half-floor high-rise and clever design ideas have turned this tiny room in the Earl's Court apartment into a home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker and a passionate real estate developer, traded her grand Knightsbridge home for the Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in a much larger area in Knightsbridge", Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would match the price I was offering.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same height charts.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day".
Since our first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - the bedroom was accessed by walking through the kitchen - and Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a second floor to take advantage of the high slopes.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands", he said.
She hired Erfan Azad from Notting Hill architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12-foot-tall (9.8 m) logs to create a home that would be more than just a development site, but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to put two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-story where you could stand.
Erfan had to be creative.
"The metal structure is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bow.
It was not just a platform construction, but we used a steel structure to make sure that the height of the upper and lower rooms was right".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in the room next to each other with plenty of dramatic elements.
Halfway up, an old-fashioned bronze-lit Retrouvius window opens onto a glamorous living room with a view.
The gold mirrored furniture, silver details and the retro Serge Mouille lighting emphasize the room's style.
The use of mirrors adds to the theatricality, spaciousness and lightness.
The short hallway has mirrors at either end to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored back wall gives the impression of a window to the other room.
At the entrance, a mirrored cupboard provides storage for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the charm of the living room is the ability to close the kitchen when not in use, creating the illusion of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But the unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a garage-type sliding door.
"It took some design work", explains Erfan, a door made of MDF with a steel-strength spoon.
"It has counterweight, so it slides very easily when pushed up".
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne now has an additional 50 square feet [16 sq m], an additional bedroom, and a better floor plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor is what you sell - or what gives the property value", says Erfan.
"A real estate agent walks into a room in an outdated uniform and makes calculations based on the floor area".
Here, they have been able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you touch and that helps you to form an emotional bond with your home", says Erfan.
"You're not gonna fall in love with the power cord in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart speak".
It shows that good design and increased floor space can help turn a fairly ordinary apartment into something amazing.
In fact, they may make you want to stay, as Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter at a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the money you make, and then you forget about ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the movie, I'm starting to think this is the business version of House of Cards, even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler have similar lines.
But as the film progresses, the less the film-like element becomes, the more the moral intent of the filmmakers becomes apparent.
The main character's life-changing experience is when his son is diagnosed with cancer.
Now you have to choose between work and family life.
A son with dreams of becoming an architect makes his father think about the really important things on his walks to the great buildings of Chicago like faith, kindness, love... not even the twin towers disaster.
After the third scene, when the son opens his father's eyes, it seems that the filmmakers' goal is to make the audience cry, for even the most loving viewer cannot hold back tears as he sees the suffering of a beloved boy with cancer.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his work and gives a good deed to an old man looking for work.
Now, I'm gonna bet myself that if the movie is happy, I'll reward my transparency with coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, I can give the writer at least one surprise.
For a moment, I suspect I'm missing my coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes slowly down the hallway to the palace.
Instead, the son has made a miraculous recovery, and even though his father has just lost his job, that is a positive thing, for now he has time to care for his family.
I feel good too, I can predict the end of American drama pretty well already!
In honor of the truth, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are present.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie's gonna be a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do this for real.
In that case, he'd be first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope of keeping the chief in line.
Here's a clip from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day in office, he brought up the key problem President Donald Trump had in the White House that he planned to solve - the access of bad information to the President.
Kelly told the officials that information had to flow through him, whether it was on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information".
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits have not gone away.
"When candidate Trump was upset about dishonest media coverage, it paid off to show that he was also being honestly covered by influential publications", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaign officials said the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes praise".
- I got it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't -- that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about any tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his aides could save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from continuing to stir up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing cliques, people are trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldview, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, covering the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of questionable strategic value.
One example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is this:
"Present and former Trump aides say Trump can react to negative press, especially damaging leaks, "explosively, obsessed with revealing their source.
This was the case in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article on the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of several leaks" to the White House.
It doesn't matter if Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for mocking, or if he didn't provide any concrete evidence, or if he has made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system to manage and document the documents that reach Trump".
How did you do that?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad who come to the capital don't get permission to perform on the picket fence.
There are a lot of foreigners playing music in the center of Tallinn.
Those interviewed by the Evening Standard admitted to playing in the old town without a permit from the city.
The first thing we found near the gates of Viru were three street musicians who had brought along as many dogs.
It was clear that the Rastafarians in their ragged clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the company played a song with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to her juggled three balls and called on passersby to come closer.
A third man was sitting next to them in a backpack, smoking a self-made cigarette.
These three dogs were not disturbed by the crowd.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled with the balls, said they were playing in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the association's performance was to raise money for a boat that would sail to Finland that evening.
When asked if they had asked the city for permission to perform in the old town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two and usually they give us permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
When we returned to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women with the musicians driving them away.
The company moved to the intersection of Viru Center with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three Polish youths also performed on Viru Street, one playing the violin, another the clarinet, and the third even carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide entertainment, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and housing", explained piano trio player Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that they must have permission from the city to perform.
"Of course we don't have it", he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we have to try", he added.
Estonia Bank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million in July under the public asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, increasing its bond portfolio to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not disclose any further details on the purchases.
The Bank of Estonia has previously explained in response to a question from members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase programme comprises three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold the bonds to invest elsewhere.
The purchase effect reduces the returns on lower risk assets and motivates investors to take higher risks.
In general, each central bank purchases its national government bonds under a public bond purchase programme, and no foreign government bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substitution purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Icelandic authorities on the measures in question.
The Commission notes that the Bank has not yet been able to provide any information on the capital requirements of the Bank.
The Commission notes that the sale of the assets of the Bank was not completed until the end of the restructuring period.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds will be purchased by the Bank of Finland on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again been caught in a fierce showdown with determined migrants who have ignored a ditch dug by the council to win back the land away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer villas in the open fields near Solihull Street, dubbed the "millionaire district" of affluence.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and wagons after being driven out of the land of corn, undisturbed by the ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the defensive lines, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left to walk.
Angry Moroccans have cursed the Solihull City Council, saying it is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved in on Monday night after they were evicted from Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at passersby.
The council needs to be shamed into taking action because they're useless in dealing with this problem.
The travelers were there, they were driven away, and now they're back.
"They came last night, probably more today".
He added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this sort of thing by procuring long barriers to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay city tax when the city council can't even stop something like that".
A local resident, who also asked to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last of these migrants leave and another invasion is already underway.
This time the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the pasture".
A Solihull council spokesman said: "We are aware of the unauthorised camping on the land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to paint a picture for the court when we present the case to them".
The weekend festival will be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that the world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replied that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three days of the festival.
But he says that the real makers of their field have come to Pärnu.
"If you look at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this does not happen often in our district", says the Minister of Culture.
But which festivals are the most talked about?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, there is certainly one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
"I think we all have at some point gone off the deep end", he says.
But he's gonna come up with a bunch of other names, like the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian entrepreneurs too: starting with NOËP and they can be read in a row.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high", he says.

Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW CEO, the company believes that "there are smarter options than restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these actions as recalls.
European carmakers have been promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help them comply with carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitric oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of installation of equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles for car manufacturers is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of indulging powerful carmakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which quietly abandoned the use of so-called "fraudulent devices" that allowed it to adjust the exhaust emissions to meet regulations during testing, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former CEO Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused Audit of installing a system to evade European emissions standards, thus expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
EU flags are purchased for 20 000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
The European Union flag measures 105 x 158 centimetres and has 570 educational establishments.
The flags are intended for indoor display and must be printed in high-quality printing techniques, including in indoor areas with tunnel seals, the ERR news portal reports.
The banner reads: "Gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education's price, or EUR 35 per flag.
Murder of journalist highlights growing danger in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the state of Sinaloa's most recent chaos, which is being sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and a relentless drug war.
But today, they're gathered here in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two parent journalists discuss which seems safer: to take their children to the office that was the target of a shelling in 2009 or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a sign in front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names for each column - no proof needed, just impressions and gut feelings.
Suspected of being government or cartel employees are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists - a list of villains who make reporting on Mexico's chaos a threat.
The violence is not a passing fad, and the more bodies pile up across the country, the more journalists are killed - at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. At least seven journalists have been killed in seven states so far this year.
Among the latest casualties is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere - a large picture of Valdez with a middle finger on the facade of the Riodoce building with the words "Justice" hanging there, and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his signature Panama hat.
The meeting is less than two months after his death, and reporters are discussing shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
In 2010, the Ministry of Justice established a separate public prosecutor's office to handle cases involving journalists, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been brought to justice.
As with most drug-trafficking and organized crime-related murders, which number in the thousands, journalists' killers rarely face justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to report on the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killer's information and justice, Ibarra says the security briefing is of little use.
"It's very stupid to waste your time in this meeting", he says.
"Until you know why, you don't trust anyone".
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only made it a few blocks before two men pulled him over in a red Toyota Corolla, forced him out of his car, and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates to "the twelfth river".
The gunman drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
There's been little to no word on the Valdez case.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions battle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter if a few people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa or if the cemetery is filled with lavishly decorated double-decker drug kingpins' mausoleums larger than many living people's homes.
Let's forget for a moment that peacetime refers to a coastal state with valuable ports and long drug routes to the United States run by a single cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, co-founder and director of Riodoce, 60, feels a great deal of guilt for not having been able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes facilitated the killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartel gang member who competed with Guzman's sons and was at war with them.
This piece of writing may have angered the boys - suspected gang members bought all the copies as soon as they reached the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure occurred in another newspaper article that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would live forever.
He was working for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he teamed up with five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50 dollars worth of shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with journalism without touching on the drug problem".
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters enjoyed publishing powerful research without fear of censorship and enchanting readers with printed stories that no one else dared cover.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous pursuit of the Mexican drug cartel wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on", he said when he accepted the AKC award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the responsibility that comes with being a journalist - the other option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was happening".
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the joker who cursed like a sailor, the friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from his office across the street to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love affair was his undoing.
His death has also left them questioning how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs".
"These things were not to be touched", said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and isolation even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells fishy, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that is what happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly banned from the room where Riodoce employees were meeting for security training; a few days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two policemen were outside the house, looking for relief from the 110-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office, a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered half-heartedly if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police the governor himself has branded untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters have traveled to the mountainous countryside where de facto drug gangs are in control.
This week's issue of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a story about the government spending money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so I had to be careful when it came time to write what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a favorite spot for both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant is registered to a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for most of the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of extensive coverage in corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to cover previous incidents in the same area, including how Guzman's son, who we call El Chapo, escaped from military custody.
Just a few months ago, readers would have looked up Valdez's column to get information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"Earlier we would have known what happened", said Villarreal, 46, whose slim build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been cut".
Valdez's office has become a storage space for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has been given something they never expected - activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was found and officials say DNA tests indicate it belongs to her.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country, writing the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On that day, Director Bojorquez is out in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from reporting government activity, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "locked in" by organized crime, complicit government officials and any society.
In his latest book, "The Journal of Drug Abuse", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who are embroiled in organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year on police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, presumably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my reporting".
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of their correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.
Others continue to shoot, as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its editor in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with the front-page headline "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still have to patrol the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're hunted down, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four other women in a Mexican apartment in 2015, three months after escaping from Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting on the drug trade scares her.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
One recent Friday at midnight, after the latest issue had already been locked, Riodoce editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside their office sipping beers when suddenly everyone's phones started to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in gun battles between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continues on the front lines, as promised by several cartel messages found in the area.
On the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day's cover needed a change.
Sirens were ringing, another gun battle in the area.
Bojorquez peered at the officers on guard to see if they were awake.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, with his middle finger visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce staffers edited in his footsteps.
"How could anyone even think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
The dinosaur used a protective dye to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a figure, although it's quite scary.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the incredible size of a rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by his armor was a reddish-brown color and that his past had been somewhat "convoluted".
A report in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredible preservation has fascinated scientists, who describe it as "really remarkable".
This armoured herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He found something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done to dig the animal out of the 2,500-pound [1,100 kg] plot.
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you look at it a little, you can almost believe it's asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
By examining its skin, scientists found that this herbivore, although covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely under significant threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This multi-armed dinosaur used red and white protective colors to hide from predators and employed a technique called camouflage, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, experts say, allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, since larger dinosaurs likely hunted it.
This 110-million-year-old creature of the nodosaur family made the news for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a lab technician at the Borealopelta Mark Mitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering the animal's hard-to-find nature.
Thanks to the remarkable preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the arches on the animal's body.
They discovered the shading, a common defense mechanism in the animal kingdom, which meant that the upper part of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although sheltering is common, the findings come as a surprise because the Borealopelta is much larger than the sheltered animals of today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs actively enough that evolution preferred to hide as a survival tactic rather than confront.
But most modern-day animals that use shielding - such as deer, zebras, or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nodosaur had to work really hard to survive.
"The fierce hunt for a dinosaur covered in enormous and abundant arches shows how dangerous predators from the Cretaceous dinosaurs could have been", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the fins also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell to its death in the river, reaching the ocean with the current, where it sank to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably extended farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved arthropod skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, preserving the original form of the animal", Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost exactly as it did in the Cretaceous.
It takes little imagination to reconstruct it - just blink and it seems as if it is asleep".
The Cretaceous was a time when the Earth was inhabited by giant, two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that was 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighed six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The existence was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and it is intact from the cone to the hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet [five meters] in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two 20-inch-long spines protruded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armoured herbivore ventured through what is now western Canada until a flooded river threatened its open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve its arches in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the mucous plates along the dinosaur skull are still covered with skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Such a level of sustainability is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it seems.
The fossilized skin remains still covering the mucous plates of the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to it and the five toes are extended upwards.
I can count the arrows he has on his back".
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock.
Just one day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb room, surfing Facebook on his phone.
He got the job after his old schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying in the street".
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user post with the extension @TheePharoah was shared repeatedly on his timeline.
A St. Louis-area rapper posted a live tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, left there for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up his phone, but later that night saw another tweet, this time announcing a gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police birds and screaming people were shared, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream of a police officer standing with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another officer, he said, brandished a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals".
Ferrell recalls thinking, "This is unusual".
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to, and what we might call typical.
I felt the scary stuff in there.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a flight back and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?"
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, they resumed the conversation they had had many times before that morning - about the experiences and living conditions of blacks.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he remembers asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right".
"I couldn't help but take her", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow up in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, and at the same time, he needs to know about the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we have to do to get free and to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without her experiencing a personal experience of blatant racism, she's no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice if I were to protect her from this world".
The first stop they made on their way to Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place across the street from the police station that had become a sort of campground where activists waited for news of officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9", she said, noting that when she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Union and focused on food rights and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just all went wrong".
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, co-director of a film, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell's question was, "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to the myriad cases of people, often white, coming into the community and trying to reap the benefits of its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already signed with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
Her involvement made the project compelling for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the cast of "Whose Streets?" for years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or to us, we speak for ourselves", Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed because that's how I was portrayed".
Although the focus was not on Ferrell's experience - it was to show that the movement was not about "a savior leader, but about bringing the community together", as Folayan put it - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw a finished linen work.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people has to come with a certain vulnerability".
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights and re-focuses the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement that came up with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin are gay.
"Black gay women have kept the movement in its prime", said Ferrell, "because we have to fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black gay women have to carry all that burden".
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women".
He also claims that "it's not about creating any kind of equal opportunity thing" - Ferrell was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man who breathed the right energy", she said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the line, "because as a black gay woman, "there's a lot at stake in living at these junctures.
His energy can be felt through the screen".
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The suspended sentence imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road during the protest will continue for another two and a half years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home as simply "a dust bowl".
Yet he still holds to a mantra he has memorized since he walked the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
7 Tips for Getting Over a Cough After a Weekend Party
Some tough guys find that after a party of drinking, whatever the hell it is, it helps.
Or, as they say, "stay drunk, stay drunk".
But it's just inevitable procrastination and a healthy snack.
After the weekend trolley ride - or other party - today and tomorrow, what can you do to feel better in the morning and to get over the cough as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Alcohol down and over, after a big party in the morning... or even alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it consumes alcohol, it must somehow replenish it.
Minerals are also eliminated from the body along with water, and therefore mineral water is a good drink.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a sip, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly be a mistake to go to Grandma's house to chop down trees - a fatal mistake.
But a brisk walk helps the body recall what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and coughing up coughs is a more time-consuming way to recover.
Give your body energy back slowly and gently.
If you're sick of the last night's drinking, you shouldn't try to load up on a big fat steak.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains the fruit sugars that your body will slowly swallow.
If you're already in a bad mood around lunch, you might want to try a broth.
And a little later, the back.
- Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will drain your body of every last drop of water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on the painkillers.
If you take a pain medication to prevent nighttime dizziness, your liver has to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and it loses performance.
You'll damage your liver even more and the stutter will get worse.
Besides, the painkiller doesn't stay in your system very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already full stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along fine.
It's kind of like walking, except walking doesn't bring you to orgasm.
Avoid over-exercising and crazy poses - exercise should be moderate during the stutter.
- You got to be kidding me.
Talk silly things to your fellow sufferers, do simple stupid things, and laugh at yourself and others.
Laughter may not stop the cough, but it certainly makes the aftermath more enjoyable.
One day the cough will go away!
A Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder.
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a Chicago apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder in their alleged connection to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the files, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and found the victim with multiple stab wounds on his body upon arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at Northwestern University, said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem has been suspended and banned from the Northwestern campus.
"This is now a criminal matter for the proper authorities to investigate, and Northwestern University is working with investigators", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way we can".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of communications for the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly working to locate them", Guglielmi said.
According to Google, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Google said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police description, it was a wet scene.
According to Google, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren are in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship", Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza administration sent a letter to residents: "Police are now working to establish the chronology of events and the victim's background and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute".
Startups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even though he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"The system was just not consistent and objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco that sells hair care products.
So he called in outside help.
A new type of HR startup is emerging to help companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the explicit purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct snap polls, target specific teams and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases allow speakers to go past C-level managers and directly to management.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where's Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, cofounder and CEO of Glint, a Redwood City startup whose software analytics tools companies use to measure employee engagement.
Erretti says that in the three years he has been using Glinto, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys targeting specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the least support, allowing it to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay on top of their work culture so they don't become the next Uber, which has been mired in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment that punished those who dared speak up.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have a view is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity this year amid Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message hotline to allow employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has been hijacked by regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating or unethical, it can face serious consequences, including consumer boycotts, layoffs, and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to follow up on employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, it is possible to identify and address problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices more quickly, which previously did not reach managers who worked in offices in other cities or states.
"I can get closer to a holistic 360-degree experience for employees", said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees".
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after the collapse of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen for ethical violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media matured" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being washed publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent was funded in February with $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the capital raised to a value of $47 million.
In November, Glint was invested $10 million by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today's workers have more expectations at work than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the bets on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy at a company, feel heard and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to making the company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of overall benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergent and Glints.
Investors earn a return when the companies in their portfolio do well; companies do well when their employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder they're gaining traction.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to work culture experts.
But that data is useless unless the company's supervisors do something about it.
In fact, asking employees for feedback can create expectations that change is coming.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough or at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 interviews", said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management firm, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too heavily on data collection.
"Because when things don't go as planned, the employees think, 'Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who now conducts surveys of employees every six months, was able to implement the measures on the same day the problem was reported through Glinte.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
However, new data on employees are being collected on Ruby Tuesday and it is hoped that this will lead in the long term to a greater commitment of employees in an industry known for its high labour flow.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you lose people", Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.

The Baltic States are the brightest star of the euro area: income is growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income levels of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg reports, citing a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
The success of the programme is due to low debt, rapidly improving institutions and pro-trade and free-market policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita is significantly close to the EU average in terms of purchasing power", the central bank said.
Although the aim is to bring GDP per capita to the level of Western Europe, in 2015 the GDP per capita of the Baltic economies was only two thirds of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the enlargement cycle in 2004.
Low wages have led the Balts to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the locals are not enthusiastic.
According to the most recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians rated their economies as doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents felt this way about their economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice-a-day practice is making the Bruins' days longer.
It's almost 11 p.m. when a trio of UCLA football players stop to chat on the edge of the team's new practice field on campus.
Some of them have stripped their shirts, revealing the sweat from their first day of training camp.
For most of the crew, those power-ups provide a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players in the summer camp will head back to the community center to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 a.m. meeting the next morning.
"The next three days are going to be a real challenge for them", said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the players' twice-daily practice to reduce the pressure has actually made their days longer - at least until they're halfway through their finals on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three practice sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 to fit the players' already busy schedule.
The transition from two training days to one training day means more training days - the start of Bruins training camp was moved up almost a week from last season and for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood, training will be held during summer classes.
They have 18 practice sessions until August 20th before they officially begin preparations for their opening game in September against Texas A&M.
Mora says he's in favor of changing NCAA rules, even though it adds another item to the players' busy schedules.
"They have a huge load for three or four days and it's a serious challenge", said Mora.
"And they break through the challenge; they push hard, they're nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really fun".
Once camp is over, UCLA will shut down training, which is no easy task given the clear view of these fields from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskini Center, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by a defensive net surrounding the goal post with footballs that have escaped.
As of this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora admitted that there may be problems with rooms available during the season.
"We're taking security measures", said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a training session from there.
If you have a recording of the training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use security there and in parking lot eight.
We're gonna do the best we can with what we've got.
I'm trying not to worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born in revenge for the Centre Party, the election union formed by the merger of the forces of Kristiina Ojulandi, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, forced to leave the ECRE, Our Tallinn, and the businessmen's election union, which hopes to show its hand to party members in Tallinn, Act - it seems that the election union created on the initiative of those who were burned in party politics will participate in this year's local elections at least as much as the parties.
But the tibs are counted in the fall, and the key question is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
The small number of Edgar Savisaare's supporters is indicated by the events organized in honor of his campaign union.
One member of the Rajya Sabha, some former and current centrists and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral alliance?
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare are not running in Tallinn be that the "Savisaare list" of corrupt officials, led by corrupt officials and suspected corruption offenders, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song filmed on the roof of the municipal government, featuring an elder in the Lasnamäe district, and a completely original computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid the bitches and squirrels on the road while riding his bike - is this how the Centre Party is trying to get the votes of the 16 and 17-year-olds allowed to vote for the first time?
We'll have to see what other parties think of the youthful campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, a viewer of Kanal 2 or TV3 is to watch a black box instead of entertainment programmes, he will have two options: agree to watch only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels in the future, or hand over the tenth of each month to some television operator.
There are likely to be those who at first publicly enjoy an ad-free TV experience but who eventually - reluctantly - pay for the television and the ads.
Deafening music, noisy crowds, and trash left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the noise, instead of getting your head knocked off at home, it's worth exploring your homeland and letting the festival guests sleep in for a hefty sum.
Washington is changing the green card rules.
The media is quoting President Donald Trump as saying that a new US immigration plan is in the works that will change the rules for green cards.
The plan includes a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family orientation visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The bill will reduce the chain of command and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process will give preference to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media reports.
Siberian settlers move to the city, retirees back to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous gold miners of the ancient settlements on the banks of the river Mana.
He works as a truck driver in a gold mine on the Kuvai, a tributary of the Mana River, some 90 miles [140 km] from his home.
It's hard work: two months of 12 hours without a day off, then only 10 days at home and back again.
In three years at Artel, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There is a strict policy: no liquor is checked when entering, and no gold is checked when leaving", says Anatoly.
Mare Piho talks to a local resident, Jan, who has told her a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture of the Siberian setos, which is still intact, is beginning to influence the home setos because it is simply so amazing, says Piho Mare, the most thorough researcher of the distant setos.
It's been 30 years since his first expedition to Siberia.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers did migrate to Siberia in the late 1800s and early 1900s to get land here?
It's an open question.
I say eight thousand.
I figured it out from the stories of the Siberian set men who have thought of it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, since at that time a group of up to 30 people could enter, but only a man was given a passport.
Only one person was issued a passport, but he had children, sisters, and female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was several times the size of the historic Setom.
It had to be educated, managed somehow.
The Setos came here as farmers, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (plowing), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many of the coyotes later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet government built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the settlers make up the majority of the population in this area at that time?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of intermarriage and the practice of having many children persisted for a long time.
Seven or eight kids in a family was normal.
How different was the culture of the Siberian settlers from that of the native settlers?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folktales.
They did it themselves, but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change has had a profound effect on the traditional dress of the Sete, since it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setol, they salted the meat, but here, they just froze it.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Sete and what kind of life is lived there? / Graphic: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
I think it's starting to give Setland back to them, start to affect them.
These girls who have lived in these families have heard amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the delegation of Estonian settlers who came to Haida in early July for the Seto Kingdom Day and stayed in the houses for four days - J. P.
What's left here, it's amazing.
"It's very easy to get to and from the city because it has a great location: at a railway junction and at a road junction", says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapal.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural places and pizza is everywhere.
Kill is the top of the top of the city!
There's a small island in the White River that runs through town where the assassins usually have a Javanese feast.
"You can't see that beautiful place from the train window", Reigo murmurs.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there. I can do it.
You can picnic by the river and just have romance - face the river and think about life.
I've been there myself, taking walks with my girlfriends.
Among other things, Tamm, an opera singer, has been to the riverbank between three bridges to practice her arias: "Because this place is on the edge of the city, no one may come to see me when I tell my stories".
"The mountain offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play disc golf - a golf course is built, you can borrow chairs from the sports centre", says Reigo.
Old pros go there with their records, of course, but I haven't been there yet.
I think we should invite our colleague Rasmus Kull to visit us, because he's an experienced disc golfer and he has chains.
I think he's gonna lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and victories left on this mountain in my sporting life.
Not to mention the broken sleighs and skis.
"The whole city centre is now full of construction, it's all changing to an unknown", says Reigo.
But killing an old and tired waxworks is a very attractive place to play summer squash.
I am happy that in 2012 the head of the R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to make a summer theater in the Vasa with his theater.
Although this year's season of "Alexey Karenin" has just ended, on August 11th, the train station will have "Awakening", as the old waxworks is moved back to the 1980s.
"From August 11 to 13, the town of Tapa will be a day of open house cafes and cultural events, including a rally", says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old town on those days.
The small yellow house on the 1st of May Boulevard has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but it has a lot of exhibits and a lot of information", says Reigo of the place, which is full of history of the city of Tapa, much of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo says that if Talla goes through all the recommended places, the big guy's gonna be hungry, but luckily, the small town is full of coffee shops.
"We have such good restaurants, and sitting in cafes sometimes feels like you're in a foreign country", she explains.
The educated and young soldiers who come to the plain spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but around you there is such an international society together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry was quoted by bTV as saying that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people, including two Bulgarians, who were camping illegally on the Sithonia peninsula.
They were released the same day, but they're under investigation.
The Foreign Ministry told the bTV television channel that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught camping in a place not intended for camping.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry says the court can impose a fine.
Puppies are taught wolves go to the sheep to break.
After the year is over, the farmers in this area must again give the wolves "learning material" from their herd - the wolves who trained the puppies have probably already killed a number of sheep.
Wolves have killed sheep three times this year, injuring 23 and injuring eight in the county, reports The Wolf Magazine.
I only had three of those before, 124 the year before.
The data from the Environment Agency also shows that there were no wolf packs on the island and the information from the Hunting Council of Hiiumaa that two wolf packs were recorded on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves attacked 15 sheep in the village of Emmaste in Kabuna, wounding half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves attacked a sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and severely injured another, which had to be euthanized.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent to the coordination group the draft law on the release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the amendment to the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act eliminates the need to create a separate database for both the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops and the operators, for which the plant health register will be used in future.
In addition, the obligation for the operator of a GM crop to have a prior agreement with the apiculture operator within the specified radius is amended.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
At least until the decision is made to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health at the Ministry of Agriculture.
'It must be borne in mind that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors,' Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the database of locations and handling training of GM crops in the GMOVS, and establishes the requirements for handling and starting economic activities of GM crops.
Specifically for beekeeping, the obligation to inform the beekeeper of the start of the GM crop is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the production.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and to submit their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if they wish.
The planned changes will mainly affect persons working in the crop production sector, beekeepers and the Agricultural Office.
Only one GM crop, MON 810 maize, is allowed to be grown in the European Union, including Estonia.
However, so far no Estonian farmer has shown interest in growing GM crops.
This is due to the absence of the maize pest, the European corn borer, to which maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, varieties of this corn line are grown in southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to ensure that this is the case, the Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GMOs in the seeds of various varieties of canola, maize and soybean grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the investigation concluded that the seeds of the rapeseed, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia did not contain the genetically modified organisms.
The Commission also concluded that the conditions for granting the aid were not met.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40million Chelsea signing started United's final pre-season game in Dublin ahead of a 2-1 UEFA Super Cup win over Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in the defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free rein on the attack.
But having been sidelined by the Blues on their pre-season tour of Asia, Maticus was badly short of form and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he needed to fix before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset", Mourinho said.
"Let's get him back in shape as soon as we can".
Like Matic, the other new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting lineup at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho began to quietly put in his starting eleven for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho was still keen to sign three more players, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "great job" by signing three of his four priority picks.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four", he added.
"I'd be even happier if they could do four out of four, but they've worked so hard for me".
Another of the blood brothers got a GSM transmitter on August 1st, this time in Muhus.
According to the birdwatcher Matt Martinson, the first offspring was born in the Ring, and the nest is already flying around, leaving the nest and joining the large nesting colony of the Great White.
That's because there are no crops in the Finger, says the Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, relatively late for the ringing of the ears, another stepson was delivered to the sender, and that was on the Isle of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
I had a stepson named Matt equipped with a GSM transmitter in the Ring of Turkey.
'His activities are all over the Internet: he went to Spain for the winter, came back and spent some time on the German-Polish border, then came to Iceland,' Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to allow him to enter his house and car with his handcuffs.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could simply wave his hand to open his front door, enter an office, and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip placed between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hospital of Winchester in the Hampshire Hants to ensure the implant procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces the locks on houses and cars to match the chip, charging £300 for each lock.
This married father of one has now installed the technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which fires when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents leaked to TIME magazine, the White House decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month to celebrate American manufacturing cost the South Side taxpayers a whopping $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the president's time on board, was the centerpiece of an event at the White House on July 17 to introduce America's construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured the 50 states to review industrial products.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was on display along with a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi-made fork lift.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the helicopter's operations team, the White House War Cabinet requested a helicopter presence subcommand, or FARGO, for just under 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Side yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event", the commander of HMX-1 told his commanding officer, the deputy commanding officer of the Navy's aviation division, in an email the day before the event.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the south courtyard on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the event, which would begin at 3:15 p.m., and remain there until the courtyard was cleaned between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. that evening.
It added that if the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to work hours restrictions.
The initial flight crew was with the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its ground time.
The documents provided to TIME magazine did not indicate whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event might violate that provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told it did not", wrote the commander.
"You don't seem to have a choice", replied the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event an official "Made in America" event and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts to reform health care that were being discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for photo shoots is unusual.
Trump came into the spotlight in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, was backlit by a presidential jet, and his Twitter account is awash with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the jet.
"The White House is very excited about the 'Made in America' exhibit, which showcased products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials", said acting White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct test flights around Washington and the South Side courtyard to practice landing the President of the United States on the White House with centimeter precision.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 test landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight was considered part of the "Made in America" training flight schedule for the flight crew that month.
The helicopters of the squadron flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit from this event was a burden on the taxpayer.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organization of the exhibition in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents for presidential flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year hourly rates, the VH-3D's compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The flight records stated the duration of the flight from this base to Quantico Naval Air Station in Virginia was 30 minutes each way.
The White House claims that the actual cost of operating a helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayer costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading", Walters said.
'These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
The 2015 RAND study shows that the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but do cover fuel, maintenance and contract-related costs.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The point is to showcase this week's Made in America", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to bring it up".
It's unclear if Trump was involved in a helicopter crash while performing a tour of the South Side courtyard, but he was behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, making fun of the media for the company's products in his personal fleet of aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of their products".
Grit Shadeiko - Through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Shadeiko was caught in the last area, 800m run on the foot ramp and the girl was carried off the stadium with a crutch.
Just before that, he had scored a zero in the long jump at a university in China.
In 2012, she was injured in a crash at the Helsinki EMI, but she finished 23rd in her debut Olympics in London with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Championships, the Estonian record holder injured her finger in the long jump after the opening day.
Two years later, she finished 15th at the Beijing World Championships, meeting the Olympic standard, but even that was a disappointment to the athlete who wanted more.
The heaviest of the jumps was only passed by Shadeiko when she failed to score in the long jump at the Amsterdam EM.
I just want to put together a proper multi-event for once.
"Once", said Shadeiko.
Worse still, a month later, his Rio Olympics were cut short by a thigh injury at the first hurdle.
Time to take off - should we even continue the Seven?
Is two days of effort still worth all this?
She thought long and hard, but she found peace.
I've cleared my head.
It's a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, I had time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in my bag yet", says Shadeiko about her self-cleaning.
I got to start fresh and move on.
Coach Anne Mountain said that it was very hard to watch the sufferer suffer, but she realized that the athlete must first of all find his own way.
He was so dismissed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said she wouldn't give up and that she wanted to prove herself", says Mountain.
Now he's at peace.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The competition returned in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzi multi-event.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal best by almost a metre (13.89) in the javelin and ran a time close to the record in the hurdles.
Then the multi-athlete felt that it was not a limit of ability, but was merely a first competitive hunger.
The Mountain, who has been her mentor for years, says Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete, good to train.
If something's wrong, he'll tell me right away.
He knows his body and trusts his instincts.
That's the way to go.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not a workout person", he says, adding that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, which will ensure a good result.
The happiness of a baby is a joy
The happiness of those close to Shadeikole has also brought good emotions.
Both his former training partner Maris Mountain and his sister Grete recently became parents and the multi-sport athlete has gained the support of new climate citizens.
"It's been really interesting", says Shadeiko.
One alcohol that drinking is equivalent to "brain training".
Livestrong reports that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big wine fan that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
He was not talking about alcohol or its effect on our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
When we smell the glass, swirl the wine in our mouth, savor it, and taste it afterward, we are activating our brain to create the taste of the wine.
According to Shepherd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is produced by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" color.
"Taste is not in wine, taste makes wine taste", says Shepherd.
Other factors that affect the taste of wine include our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Of course, Shepherd warns that wine is not for getting drunk.
"There must be more to the action", he says.
If you take too big a shot, the system overloads.
Excessive drinking can harm the brain rather than help it - a 2004 study found that people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, impaired balance, and decreased mental function.
10% of Estonian ICT workers are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment firm Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT workers are paid less than their colleagues.
The gender pay gap is 10 percent, reports the portal Genius.
The Fontes ICT salary survey involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of the positions were held by men.
'Although only three companies claimed that the pay gap is in favour of men and the remaining companies claim that there is no pay gap, in reality, when comparing similar jobs, men's monthly basic pay is on average 10% higher than that of women and men's total annual pay is on average 8% higher than that of women,' said Fontese analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel is at the center of the Netflix hit series.
Despite the fact that the second season of Narcos exposed the killer of Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed on the streaming service and the first of them has already been produced, which will add new villains to the show.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug cartel, the Cali Cartel.
They operate like a Fortune 500 company, run by four powerful godfathers, just with more bribes to the government and more violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brains of it, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the ties with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released commercial, Pedro Pascali returns as Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos season three opens on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics.
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only be representative of the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN aid mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"The importance of the role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Commission will also be able to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will be held on 5 April.
The Taliban have threatened to delay the election process, which coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes more prominent.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything great, big and small.
Time alone is always too short, but training with the kids is a good way to combine the meeting, the play, the intimacy and the load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you sail in the summer, you will always have the live deer with you, eagerly reminding you in their delicate voice, "Let's get some exercise!"
Start with warm-ups - a regular game of pool or a beach-jumping game is very good.
The thigh is the foundation for staying fit on your feet and in the ash - who would want to take the shape of a sand pie crushed by waves during the summer?
It's amazing to use children instead of a cane!
First, it's safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also make a fuss with quite large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to be heard and to be important.
Older children can make their own dumplings at the same time.
Range of motion: Fix by touching the ground and holding your hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, have the mini-assist hold it tight.
The kid can read the rehearsals and feel like a coach.
The plank is a superb exercise, but hopelessly boring for a child.
But it's easier to make it more fun!
Playing board: take a long plank column, which you take turns to go through.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun than shaking hands with a friend.
To add weight, you can stand on a flat, small stool and walk around in this position.
The extra weight may be to sit on the younger child's hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs hiss in the sand, the trichops, the spleen and the abdominal muscles are burdened like a snail.
The child is placed on his feet so that his body weight is distributed evenly between the front and back of the body.
For safety, you can hold hands.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
A bird can fly, have fun, balance, and be a burden.
Life is extra fun for a little coach when he gets a little kiss every time he steps up.
The extra load is caused by stretching the legs.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Kids themselves have a lot more fun doing their abs in pairs and clapping.
Handmade and pulsed.
Keep the child in a safe position, the knee position, and keep the back in a neutral position.
A favorite of all children and a great fun!
For the elderly, it's a really effective whole-body workout.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Spark (8), and Happiness (4).
From the Philippines, a journey to the heart of the world, or shoulder bag
The summer classic, the beer bag, has become a hit in its own right in recent years, a must-have for any true summer lover, and a price tag that has been known to be a hit by merchants despite its modest origins.
A shoulder bag is probably one of those things that has been around for a while and that has not caused you any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, nothing's broken.
Now, though, shoulder bags are in full swing, and fashion fans have traded in their fancy designer bags for simple shoulder bags for the summer months.
And it's not just a beach bag. Today, it's a popular street bag, and even the bolder women walk into the office with it.
But before you do, you might want to decide if your boss still wants to wear that summer look or if you'd rather put your laptop and laptop in a more formal place.
But the ever-changing wealth has made the shoulder bags a real summertime love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that strikes one is that fashion goers go to the local market on vacation and buy a shoulder bag that they will wear throughout their vacation, and that they will wear to the beach, the market, and even to hang out with their girlfriends.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags at the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is noteworthy, though, that the demand for bags is so great among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to become the happy owners of a bag.
In a sense, this madness is understandable, for there are few times in the fashion world when a high-end item can be bought for just a few tens of dollars.
True, clever merchants have also found a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably so the wealthier customers don't feel like the commoners who walk around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag that costs over a thousand euros.
Chanel's shoulder bag can cost around 6,000 euros to interpret.
Unlike most fashion designers, shoulder bags did not originate with a major fashion house.
Shoulder bags are said to have originated in the Philippines, where they have been worn widely.
The export business is the most important, and local people are not often seen to be involved.
The technique of brewing beer is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the traditional basket weaving.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as tightly folded as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it to make it more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently, bags with colored ribbons or leather straps have become especially fashionable.
But the shoulder bags can be sent in particular to Jane Birkin, the actress, who is the biggest fan of the shoulder bags.
It was a shoulder bag that matched all sorts of outfits and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
Not to be overlooked is the fact that the bags are a pain in the ass to care for, and unlike all other sumadans, they do not require special care, but are treated with water and a wet towel.
As with all trends, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations beyond the classic look.
For example, if desired, a shoulder strap or a small shoulder bag may be provided.
But it's worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag will never go out of style, but the shoulder strap will.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a shoulder-length bag, which is shaped like a basket, open at the top and has short, shoulder-length sleeves, has been considered a classic.

A woman builds a house - a wooden house instead of a funk house
A man who went missing three days ago has been found on the island.
Aare left his home in the Alevik of Kärla on Wednesday evening in an unknown direction.
The last contact with Aarga was by phone yesterday, Friday night, and the phone's positioning gave the man's location in the Western Isles, some village, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and dogs until the early hours of the morning.
Then the battery on her phone died, and the man could no longer be located.
Police have resumed their search this morning.
The police thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is waiting for confirmation from the management of McVitie's biscuit factory about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the investment at the Tollcross site.
The factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products employs over 500 people.
The owner of the McVitie's company, Pladis, said they've invested more than £5 million in the facility over the last couple of years.
There, more workers were hired and union leaders were "the first to know" if anything changed in the factory.
In a letter to the company's facility manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to 'resolve concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise the production lines'.
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the facility manager on the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plan is a matter of deep concern to our members.
It has been home to generations of families and a workforce largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow area, providing a vital support for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So Glasgow East needs a firm in McVitie with a strongly growing productivity in terms of jobs, wages and welfare and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production.'
A spokesperson for Pladis said: 'The manager of the Customs Cross facility received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place at Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we would be reviewing our operations on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and facilities - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'Over the past few years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand the legacy of the Tollcross facility and if there are any changes in the operations of the facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know.'
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago not to approach Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain are not giving up on their bid to lure Neymar into their ranks, making a £189 million offer to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest?
This hilarious approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is poised to more than double the current world record for acquisitions, set last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with a salary of over £500,000 a week after the payment from PSG.
Barcelona are angry about both the approach and Neymar's release, although a source close to the Catalans board confirmed that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif issued a stern warning to any club considering signing some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will respond and contact those players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign any of our players, they'll face the consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be hit by this interest, losing one of their prized assets in the form of Neymar.
PM: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
'Brexit threatens to severely tear the divide between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland,' Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from this", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of people and goods that we have today, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders", he stressed.
Mr Varadkar said he would prefer the UK to remain in the EU and, if it could not, to remain in the single European market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the UK's exit smoother would be to create a customs union between the EU and the UK, the Irish prime minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have one with Britain".
The alternative would be to return to customs posts, which would herald a historic split and political failure.
"An obstacle to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Mar Avandi, who completed his first half-length triathlon, said that anyone can do the Ironman.
Today, the Baltic's largest triathlon festival was held in the winter capital, Otepää, with about a thousand triathletes from over 30 countries taking part in the half-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of a 1.9 km swim, a 90 km cycling and a 21.1 km cycling.
Among others, Avandi won his first triathlon.
"I thought it would be difficult, and it was", Avandi admitted at the finish.
Despite the difficulty, Avandi realized that triathlon is really a sport that can be enjoyed by all.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace", he said, implying that with a good pace, almost everyone will get to the finish.
Except for Ott Sepp, who says, "Ott's body is fine, but he can't swim".
Avandi had been training hard since February.
Four or five hours a week at first, then ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, she finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he beat other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model", lost to Avandi by seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan by 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm by about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The overall winner of the Ironman series men's stage of Otepää was crowned the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Groot with a time of 04:14:09.
The women's race was won by Helle Frederiksen of Denmark in 04:24:01, while the Estonian Maria Jänese won by losing to Frederikssen by almost half an hour and clocking 04:58:58.
Avandi swam a distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
