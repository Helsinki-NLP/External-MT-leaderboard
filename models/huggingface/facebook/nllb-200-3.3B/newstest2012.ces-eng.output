Parliament has not supported the amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to abolish the paragraph that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko as part of an amendment to the penal code.
A second reading of a motion to reduce the penalty for economic crimes rejected by MPs paved the way for the release of the jailed ex-prime minister.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into an unprofitable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be heard in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict political revenge of the regime, suspicion of bias of the court has raised the process even in the West.
The motion to remove section 365 from the criminal code, which convicted the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 MPs.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, has already had its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It's just a matter of deciding the winner.
As is the custom in the country, the elections will be won by the Islamists, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has subscribed to customary Sharia law, and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will be a crime-free country, because the hand is cut off for stealing.
Women can forget about emancipation, apostates face execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
Libya will be in an order that we cannot imagine and that we certainly do not want.
But our way of life is neither the only one, nor the objectively best, and it probably wouldn't suit the Libyans I mentioned for a change.
In fact, it's odd that Islamic militants have taken the bait with the help of infidel dogs.
Their only excuse is that, in their eyes, the NATO air strikes were not led by some American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every strike.
So when they look for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have engaged in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians have disposed of a political ally in the person of the dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we're not going to invade Libya.
This eliminates the problem of local people driving out the "crusaders".
But without the occupation, will the oil companies have a mouthful of Libyan black gold?
Maybe they won't, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless we're interrupted by those Sharia law enforcers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the hunt for investors
A statistical blizzard swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have released GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated for the past three quarters, while Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary forecasts of economic developments for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their second quarter figures, with Germany ranking better than expected (up 0.3% from 0.1%), while France reported a slight decline of 0.1% (the previous figures had suggested stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated, confirming the trend of gradually slowing economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, based on preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The euro area and European Union economies grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2% year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc., are beginning to feel the effects.
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, despite the deteriorating situation in the region.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and are celebrating the progress of 200 million.
The National Football Team has completed the toughest challenge of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and a beautiful goal of Peter Jiráčka, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a big dose of luck, in the second half, grabbed a luxurious lead from home and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the match in-depth coverage.
Hardly any excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home defeat in the final, the great Czech and hero Jiráček, won in Montenegro with a happy 1:0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
The Montenegrin team was put under pressure in the second half due to the precision of the Czech team.
The match was won by Damjanović and Vučinić, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the domestic football box office will receive a reward of about 200 million crowns.
There was a lot of fighting football going on from the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to get into the mix and played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home football players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely repelled the long kicks for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They 've created a living shield .
A few hundred college students have formed a human shield around an Iranian nuclear facility.
By their gesture, they want to express support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the facility at noon on Tuesday and then chanted death to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They are showing that they are prepared to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently concluded that Iran has apparently not stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
There is talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In an attack designed to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said that the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz would be the target, along with the Isfahan facility.
The diet of an obese child: no breakfast and a steaming dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, while 9 percent of school-age children are overweight and 5 percent are obese.
And obese children are more likely to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as a recent survey has shown.
Once again, the environment in which we grow and the patterns around us are important to the healthy development of the human being.
For example, tablecloths in obese children are up to half as likely to be clogged as those in families of normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of obese people ate French fries for dinner the day before a study linked to a global campaign called Obesity is Not a coincidence.
The families of the obese also tended to be less athletic, but this is true of most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children said their parents found time for physical activity at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event, sponsored by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4 to 8 have participated in the project.
Proper diet and adequate exercise in the family are among the factors that have led to a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children.
"For example, only half of those questioned said they ate breakfast-eat-lunch-eat-eat-dinner five times a day, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition", says one survey.
No breakfast and no dinner
Experts point out that even relative details, such as a regular family breakfast, are essential to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
Most families eat breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that ten percent of the households don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper diet.
The questionnaire showed that obese children's families are much more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks a sugary soda every day (70 percent).
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly participate in sports, less than half of the parents - 15 percent - did.
Make your own menu
The second part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own menu according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition".
Their favorite foods include many meats, sweets, and meats.
"The high prevalence of sweet lemonade is particularly alarming", says the final report of the survey.
For lunch, pasta won the day over poultry.
But the children practically didn't want legumes, and the popularity of fish and vegetable lunch is low.
Health Care
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits if given the right information.
"A control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire at the end of the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' seminar showed a significant shift in preference towards healthy eating principles in a number of cases", the project results state.
It was particularly striking in the sweet soda scene, where more children would have preferred plain water.
Children were also much more likely to cross off poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and to limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylists must also be good psychologists, say professionals
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was already a lot of it in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures by three industry experts, dressing up for problem characters, and a seminar on how to get on set.
And it's going to get worse.
As we approach the final exam, more information and practical assignments await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is truly "trampled".
This time, the headmistress, Alenka, and I were discussing (there is not a single boy in the class) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly balanced figure.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Some have short necks, some have a boyish figure without any curves, and some are overweight.
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to make a Jennifer Lopez-type woman, with bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waistline, look good and not dress too revealingly.
For example, if the difference between your waist and your hips is such that your skirt or pants really don't fit, it is worth having at least one of these made to measure.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You'll feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that's constantly shifting, twisting, and slouching off your waistline and so on.
The boy figure can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery, and embroidery.
There's a lot of information and character types, of course, so I'm glad I have a whole week to sort all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the homework assignment, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design two outfits: a daytime outfit and an evening outfit.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and type of character.
I'm going to be dressing Miranda Kerr, who you may know from her Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my mind, I'm definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained maybe 100 kilos (please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or go online and print them out and then do the graphic design.
The moodboard, as the whole thing is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is important.
Stylists not only dress physically, but also create, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, loaded with information about character types, was packed with three guests from the field.
The stylist is Honza Pokorny, the fashion designer is Jakub Polanka, and the fashion photographer is Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to exploit that.
And a good stylist can work with one piece of clothing in many ways.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, a trench coat (or trench coat if you prefer) can be worn classically over jeans and a sweater as a coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear it on the shoulders and wear it as a dress.
Or you can just roll up your sleeves or your collar and the whole look is different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But the advice I appreciated most was this: "To do the job, you need to know the rules perfectly".
"Then you can start to violate them", said James.
So I finally understand why we're all scrambling to figure out what to combine with what, why, when even in fashion magazines we see something else.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more options than they can photograph.
So for a fashion story that's going to be ten pages long, I have to be prepared to "show" at least fifteen.
And that in photographs, clothes look and act differently in combination with other items than they do in reality.
So that's what we have to consider when we're designing outfits.
That style and image makes up half of success, Honza Humble confirmed.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes find it useless (it's enough that I know something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone lets us design their hair, we can expect that they will likely dictate a completely different (smaller) size than the one they actually have.
Then you just Google it and see if the tabloid has written about the celebrity being fat or thin or whatever.
Honza and Mario on Sunday made it clear that it's not enough for a stylist to know fashion and know how to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily interacts with the people he's dressing, so it's important to be a good psychologist as well.
Being able to judge people, not be pushy, stand up for yourself.
"If a manager asks you to go through her wardrobe and fill it with pretty clothes, you can't just throw her a whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.' "
"Find at least a few things that you can praise and recommend to wear", says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what must be in a so-called "sack", or carry-on bag.
It's the one you wrap around your waist and you have all the properties you need.
In addition to bright objects, such as scissors, hair rollers, or closing pins, there are also silon threads (used by stylists to help with the photographing of products such as handbags or hats), special clips to be sewn on the back of clothing if it is large (a pin or other braid is not allowed, it would damage the garment), or a sewing.
To help them not only listen but also practice, we learned how to tie their shoes properly.
Even in a studio, where the surface is flat, the sole could get damaged, let alone outdoors.
So we glued and glued.
We don't even touch the toe of the shoe, so it doesn't accidentally break.
So it takes real skill.
Mario delighted me by complimenting my creation without reservation.
The skill you're talking about is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming clearer to me that doing styling at a professional level really isn't a walk in the park, no matter who says it is.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you race across America.
Other
What started out as a carefree drive turns into a routine morning shift due to a series of completely unnecessary lazy mistakes.
While the ambition was largely achieved, it was not worth it if no one was willing to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, was highly anticipated upon its release.
He promised to take the long-running Need for Speed series in a new direction, and from the game's graphics, it seemed like a game that could not be outdone in the action racing genre.
We were also curious to see what would happen to the inserted passages in which the main character gets out of the car and runs around.
But as is the custom with the NFS series, a lot of it turns out a little different than we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing just brings down a few unnecessary bugs that have been running in the series for years or so.
So, these aren't actually mistakes, but rather some kind of inexplicable laxity on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story in which the protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution he offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
You're driving down the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to be the first to New York.
There are some interesting elements to the idea.
The circuit is divided into ten stages, followed by more than fifty races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and that the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It's not like the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics is similar to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world war.
But driving across the desert, through the autumn landscape, or high up in the snow-capped mountains is visually very pleasant.
And the races are occasionally colored with some unusual elements.
In the desert, for example, you may be caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be caught in an avalanche.
Besides, the races are pretty well set up.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of competitors (basically a classic race), then you try to catch up (a classic match with a stopwatch), and then you have a duel with a single opponent.
And the police are involved from time to time, making your efforts even more unpleasant.
New is the passages outside the vehicle.
It's more like an interactive animation where Jack is mostly running away from someone and you have to help him by pushing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not that complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer of these passages in the play than you might expect (maybe even only three).
But in the end, it's to the good of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it's one of the elements that make the game more layered.
The ride pattern follows the pattern of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely not a big deal these days, but it's not a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But in the realm of racing, the local driving pattern is still quite good, although we could do better than the competition.
So far, everything is perfectly fine.
But the problems start to show up after a while.
Unlike the road model, the collision model is not in good shape.
We don't expect a game of this type to calculate complex deformation and collision, but if you have no idea of how your car will behave before you hit anything, then it's probably not all that bad.
Typically, in close overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other lightly, but other times in almost identical situations, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack.
With the restart system, it doesn't really bother you, but it sure does.
Restarts are designed so that if you get beaten or run far off the track, the game throws you back to the last point of interception on the track.
But only five restarts are available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a "if things go wrong" kind of thing, rather than a "you can count on that" kind of thing.
But sometimes even the re-parties don't help, they're solved by the need to learn a particular section of the race by heart.
The great downside of games is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners require you to make a specific way to go, or you simply cannot get into them.
Other times, you'll find civilian vehicles in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
It's especially irritating in situations where you see the other car in front of you passing between two opposing cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happens right under your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you'll come across several places where, again, regardless of the time, you'll always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It's most striking at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there before you, obviously, at any cost.
Because when it's in front of you, it makes it harder to see the cars in front of you, so you're probably going to get a little bit messy at first.
The intention to make the game more thrilling and adrenaline-fuelled is understandable, but the execution is so obvious that you'll get bored easily.
And that's a shame, because even though it's a simple ride, it's fun to play and sometimes so action-packed that you literally don't have time to see where it's flying.
And it doesn't matter if it's the 50 unique tracks, the race sequencing that doesn't allow for boredom, or whatever.
The unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be careful at the roadside gas stations because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you'll settle for what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, heavy American bikes for smooth highways, and exotic super sports for technical driving, such as on winding mountain roads.
And with the main story mode, there's also a challenge mode, which is racing in the locations that you know from the story.
Here, you not only earn medals, but experience points for your profile, which is common to both the challenge and the story.
To get a higher level of driver, various items are unlocked: from cars to wallpapers for the profile.
It is also back-linked to the online Autolog function, which compares your scores with other players and provides additional community features, among other things.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
You drive your car into a subway tunnel, where you ride the tracks in the dark.
The speedometer flashes between 90 and 120 miles an hour, and the subway train is coming up behind you, and you're being uncompromisingly scrapped.
We'll probably have a debate in the newsroom for a few days about whether or not anyone really thought a bit about the game when they made it, or whether or not the writers think we're really that big of a jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes so that at certain moments of tension, the imaging drops, in some cases quite tragically.
But it's mostly for larger groups of people, where you're not going to get any of the smooth-scan stuff.
The soundtrack is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a wider, younger audience, the soundtrack was created in the category of "every dog is different", but it can be assumed that because of the music, people will not buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so very embarrassing.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would be safe to say that The Run is the best NFS game in years.
But this is how the game works.
I'm sure it's fun, but be prepared to have your mistakes bludgeoned into the air with the power of airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
'The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously disturbed the balance between the institutions.'
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war".
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit, for things to calm down and for all the players to get used to their new roles", Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how serious she was about her motto 'Clearly and openly about Europe' in the first part of her lecture, when she managed to describe the different EU institutions and their relationships in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the UK Law School could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First came the criticism that he was a dull, gray-haired official, "that he couldn't fill any role, "and I must say that everyone was astonished that he had done so well.
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go".
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", thus a significant step towards unifying and making the EU's policy more transparent towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban the cheese.
Vicen also devoted herself to the agenda which the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency has described the meeting in Foreluna as a success.
The Czechs have dealt with the looming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or hosted the Eastern Partnership summit.
The fall of the government at that time was a great negative, which caused the Czech Republic a lot of damage.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the fact that it was a flop" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being dealt with today.
The new seven-year EU budget has yet to be adopted, which is made even more difficult by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and frugal, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, all this is on the agenda for the next round of talks.
The EU's newly elected President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has been a key figure in the EU's efforts to bring the EU closer to the people of Europe.
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, idioms that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that Brussels really does not invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that we really need to be banned from cheesecakes".
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czech Republic has a reputation for being Eurosceptic and for seeing the negative rather than the positive side of things.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
She blames a lot of factors, like the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole or a Hungarian comes to see me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what's up with your Visegrad Four?' and he doesn't look at it with any enthusiasm".
The EU's future, according to Vicen, will be dominated by new and tough rules for the budgetary policies of member countries.
The concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new 'European federation' is seen as very real.
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, we have the institute for enhanced cooperation".
"The first time it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate should cooperate and those that did not want to stay away".
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe", she expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's innovator begins its second century
If you were to look up the word that most accurately describes IBM's strategy, the closest one would probably be "longevity".
To the general public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution, a company perceived as very modern, yet it was founded a hundred years ago.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by the company's first chief, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already made it clear that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would revolve (as well as the name of an internal IBM magazine that began publication in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continually moving toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it stayed true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else.
That's what's allowed us to transform technology, business and society in our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next century", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the firm's current director.
A sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson's approach to caring for his employees was similar to that of the Czech entrepreneur Baťa - the people at IBM were among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer's insurance plus a sleek employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and traders.
Well, as elaborate as it is, IBM has a long-term relationship with a customer.
The company was a genius at harnessing talent from the very beginning -- one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any discrimination so that they could choose.
In line with the company's anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisano to be replaced as IBM's CEO by a woman, Virginia Rometty, next year.
She's been with IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing what's called jams, online brainstorming, in recent years, and a lot of future strategies and innovations have come out of it.
No wonder the company has so many ideas - it employs almost half a million people.
Institutions with a good reputation
The firm's strong internal and external image ensures its position in the business.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an institution than a technology company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, to The Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using technology", added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between entering the market and actually creating the market.
IBM, or "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include the ATM, the credit card, the financial swap, the bar code, and the disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company this year by market capitalization (first is Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers and the times - IBM, for example, did not bet on its own operating system OS/2, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past", notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, they leave.
Unlike, say, the rival Microsoft, which basically stands on Windows.
Prospective technologies
IBM's biggest sales share is in services, with software and hardware accounting for about one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still the strongest player with more than half of the market share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold off $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, while investing $58 billion to buy promising technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the world first experienced the modern financial crisis.
IBM is following the example of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be coming through the current crisis unscathed.
The IBM stock price has risen by a rocketing 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net profit has been rising steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
So it's safe to assume that if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will be able to handle it.
IBM history: from cheese-cutter to space travel
IBM, the International Business Machines, was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally under the complicated name of the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for what would later become IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history stretches back to the 1880s.
They had technologies such as the famous "pigeons", or clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then represented the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still the foundation of an unconquerable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started out by making and selling all kinds of machines for businesses - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson headed the company, it doubled in sales to nine million dollars and began a massive expansion of the company to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly 40 years in the top job, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., succeeded him.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960's, IBM's computers and humans helped NASA to control space missions to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous manned flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "kit" that set the computer standard at the time, called the IBM 5150 was released in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer business to the Chinese company Lenovo, and in turn bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to focus on consulting and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been following for the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to use technology intelligently, in areas that may not have been planned yet, and to improve things, for example, in transport and urban management.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the domestic market as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, the company also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is based in Prague and has a world-class voice recognition research team.
The story of the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtar, 53, has called it quits!
After her husband, Josef Rychtár (53), became not only a protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from his rosy dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait any longer, and she's made a very clear decision for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtář gave Bartoš refuge in her home that summer, she probably had no idea how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of the River after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship openly, and even said good-bye to him for good.
Ryu-chan doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtár and Bartoš had broken up, he would not have been welcomed home with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our common home, no one will kick him out".
"I will not see him as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties", revealed Rychtářová, adding that she has already broken with her husband and insists on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't care that Darina closed the back door on him.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be a saint and I'm not going to change it".
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that".
"The company is moving on, I'm doing the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I'm shopping".
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed", said Lightning.
If the fairy finds a new love, she won't be prevented from doing so.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she has any boyfriends.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivetta and I take all the responsibility", Josef concluded.
The Worst Womanly Habits - Are They About You?
If you ask men to name any typical female vices, they'll usually be quick to point out.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which lists a few female vices that can perfectly pump the blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy yourself a new sweater at least once a week?
Do you like to shop at discounted prices?
Then in your case, shopping is a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their shopping habit.
But who could resist going to the clothing store to look for a good-fitting outfit and then trying them all out (ideally in different colors) in the locker room?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can become a living hell for men.
Just think of all the times you told your boy to wait for you outside the door...
Constantly Dissatisfied
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least ten pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these phrases ring a bell?
Is that so?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their looks.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent the harassment, the more annoying the women are.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless loop.
They wash windows, vacuum, wipe the floor, dust off, scrub the bathroom - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a scrubbed sink and painting the glass wall of the living room that you took so much trouble polishing?
If you suffer from this "deviance", try to remember that nothing is to be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should not be the priority in a family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and your family well-being.
Plowing
"Throw those used sneakers in the bin".
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"The wet towel is not meant to be on the floor".
If you're going to be shouting at your partner like that several times a day, you can be sure that you're going to be able to get him off your back.
Of course you don't mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is all right.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't be so worried about them.
Slander and slander
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insults and conspiracies are also common.
Women are relationship oriented, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us will unleash a little harmless gossip or slander here and there.
I'll give you that. It's a woman's thing.
On the other hand, the coarsest of grains, which like to gossip and gossip often, are perhaps despised by everyone and are especially dangerous to their environment - especially within the female work collective.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assists.
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists in Philadelphia's 5:3 win on Carolina's ice and is again leading the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
The 39-year-old star was overshadowed in both games by Claude Giroux, who added another touchdown and was named the game's MVP.
Two assists in the match were also scored by Jagra's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr told the overseas press that he predicted the Giroux would have a big night.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", explained Jagr, after which action Giroux scored the first goal of the Flyers.
A little later, the second shot was the Czech team's own.
The pitcher fought back the Hurricanes' goal and passed it between the rings to scoring Max Talbot.
With one second left in the first half, the Flyers' Patrick Dwyer took the lead in the second half.
Specifically the Giroux.
He scored the third goal after collaborating with Jágr, then his shot was passed by Wayne Simmonds in the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm glad to hear it".
"I want to play him".
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around", Jagr added.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic with Tuoma Ruutua's goal and once again Dwyera, who had come through on a penalty, was on the one-goal line.
But no further complications were to be allowed by Matt Read, who finished the countdown two to one.
"Pronger has made a great hit in our zone".
"He kicked the wheel, I picked up speed and [Read] drove to the farthest pole".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked", he described the last goal of the match from his point of view, Voráček.
Philadelphia has won the East Conference.
Montreal's Czech defensive end Jaroslav Špaček missed the entire game against Buffalo, retiring in the second quarter with an upper-body injury.
The Candiens lost their two-point lead to the experienced Beka and lost on a penalty shoot-out 2 to 3.
One of their raids did not turn Thomas the Pussycat.
The home team coach was more concerned with the back row's extensive bruising than the points lost, with the game ending with only five defenders.
"This is bad".
"We were only able to finish the game with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters".
"But there's nothing to do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"We were hit by it in turn and we couldn't resist it".
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our belt".
We had gaps in that", added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondrej Pavelec contributed 30 shots to Winnipeg's 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' five-point game-winning goal came from five different shooters.
How fares have changed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold overwhelmingly only trips to the socialist bloc countries, since travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled to the East (GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime sided with the West and the visits of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter of invitation from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but you had to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" at the travel agency.
But it still wasn't won.
The so-called foreign exchange allowance, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange guarantee it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for travel to the West.
By far the most common holiday was spent in the Czech lands, resulting in a large number of huts and cottages that the Czechs acquired, and this custom survives to this day.
Thus, since 1989, Czech travel has undergone a real revolution.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our max, last year 4.5 million Czechs spent holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
The huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that Croatia, the most popular country for us today, was not a free country to travel to until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
The abolition of visa requirements for Western European neighbours in the late 1990s triggered a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Austria's Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovakians could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in the parks because our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was to carry their own food, canned food, sausages, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the free Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to finally buy Western currency after many years of being unable to do so.
But our standard of living, and with it, average wages, were rising, which led to another important moment around 1997.
With increased travel demand, travel agencies began to arrange tours by charter flights on a regular basis from 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past, thanks to the possibility of contracting quantity discounts.
By the late 1990's, the Czechs had visa-free access to virtually every developed country in the world except the United States, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to exotics, from the Czech Republic, was sent to Thailand due to a significant demand.
Starting this year, direct charters to warm distant countries are taking off with Czech tourists every year, and this winter, there will be direct flights from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic country is now visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists, and our country was finally ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history, and spent more than CZK 15 000 per person for a single holiday abroad including costs at the place of stay for the first time in history.
The General Assembly is to find a chairman, but again there is a threat of a
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general assembly, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on the electoral procedure.
Without it, there's not even a vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest to lead Czech football is held by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashick resigned in June, and as he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hask era, football has slipped back into the fray between the two union chambers, who can't agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House in Prague on Smíchov in vain, because the meeting was blocked and it was not just about the election process.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote at the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
On this one point, there has since been partial agreement, helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law that representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral system.
The situation was not made clear by the Executive Committee, which, in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, does not deal with anything else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do you proceed in the third round to eliminate the possibility of a collision?
"The issue is whether to follow the statutes or to find another model", stated one of the three vice presidents of FAČR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win in the third round.
Morava is reportedly willing to make a concession to win the candidate who gets the higher total percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is pushing for the winner to have at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage.
"But that would make the previous two rounds meaningless, it would completely negate the two-chamber concept", the Moravian Svoboda party objects, according to which it would be best not to bend and to vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, although it is estimated that the electoral system determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I wish to vote as per the statute at the most".
"So that no representative nonsense like the last general assembly is invented", declared the owner Viktor Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his remarks he was mainly against Pelt.
The Pelta remains optimistic.
He said the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the excitement will be put down by the national team's eventual progress to the European Championship today".
"Football will be back on the wave, there will be more willingness to cooperate", says the Jablone official, who has the most experience of the three in managing football at both the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope we can reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very fractious".
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations purposefully".
"This could cause the blockage of the assembly to occur again".
"But I hope that common sense will prevail", Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for a mutual agreement.
Some of the action was supposed to take place in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete by the game.
The airline, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to travel to Podgorica, did not fly from Prague this morning due to a technical malfunction and an alternative was being sought to transport part of the Executive Committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Finally, there may be a crucial ministerial-level meeting, which is supposedly to take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobes would like to bring the divided parties within the most powerful sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming ČSTV general assembly, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
The Packlick is running for president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football players of Plzeň Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary crowd, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even signed up for the top position.
"If there is a quality adept, I will fight for him and not run for office".
"But in the current situation, no one has been found", said ČTK Paclík.
In the match against Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rajchlo, Paclík's motivation is to try to block Pelt, the alleged favorite in the elections, from becoming the leader of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasises that if he wins, he will only be able to serve as president until 2013, when the next general assembly is scheduled.
He'd like to see an experienced and top-notch manager in the job who's not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some people who might be considered".
"It was crazy for me when some people said that they didn't want to identify with Czech football at this moment".
"That's the look I want to change", he said.
Pacovilik says that what bothers him most is Peltov's connection with the president of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the General Assembly.
It's so unacceptable to Paclick that Pelta becomes chairman.
"If he wins, the status quo is preserved and nothing in football moves forward".
"Combined with the support of Berber, who is a skilled businessman, it would not be much better for football", declared Paclík.
He also points out that Pelt's name was on the wiretap in the investigation of a corruption case years ago, but Pelt got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelt win would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who also took his previous statement that he would "sell the Plzeň club if Pelta became chairman" seriously.
If Paclík wins the election, he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
The same is also being considered by another candidate Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to".
"She has great powers".
"I could imagine him as the head of the team".
"But he couldn't manage the association".
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't know how", said Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention by supporting the dismissal of the arbitration committee headed by Luďek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
The bouncer says he'd be a fool to run the association.
He's been managing Plzni since last summer, which celebrated its Premier League triumph in May with his support.
"I have the power to change the football environment, to contribute to its cultivation".
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes as far as unpleasant situations", said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy for example to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínsky.
He would also consider strengthening the FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee as a priority, with the help of which he would lobby the political elite to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing".
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but on the level they have to say where the money goes", he noted.
As a result, Paclík does not even claim his connection with the Plzeň club, even though he claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal".
"But I also see no point in hypocritically transferring my shares in a club in Pilsner and returning to it in a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised new constitutional provisions that would eliminate the electoral pat
Two days before the Football Association's general assembly, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would sit down to ensure that the FA would have new statutes that would definitively rule out future disputes over the electoral rules.
The Jablonski functionary is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that he would focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general election, so he could have a two-month reprieve to defend his ideas about football management and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"He feels it is high time that the association was led", says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablone Club but has served for many years on Sparta and the union's executive committee.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria of the Ivan Hashi's administration is behind the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had thought".
"If they didn't allow for different interpretations, we would have had a chairman since September", Pelta warned.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he had taken as a fan to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal duty and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails".
"It's a principled thing that we can't be without", Pelta says.
He's trying not to compare Dallas to his rivals.
He had already indicated that he could imagine working with Heinrich Reichl, whom he admired for his legal training, and knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He didn't attack Tomáš Paclík for long, who, on the other hand, didn't leave a trace on Peltov.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, "he's already had some success".
"His attacks were undignified, however, and surprised many people in a campaign-style manner".
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character", he said to his opponent, Pelta, who he said remains faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
His greatest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football, from the lower leagues to the national team.
That should be the football locker.
"And I'd also try to put an end to all the Bohemian affairs or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"Immediately after that, I would rush to negotiate with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football", the 46-year-old told CTV two months ago.
He also promised at the time that his coming to the helm of the football team would not mean any purges.
"I would have to get acquainted with the staff first", he said, referring to Strahov, who was understandably nervous after a long period of inactivity.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the forthcoming General Assembly, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday in vain.
"If the only point of contention is how the election will be held in the third round, we can get through it".
"Football needs credibility, and it will only get it by finally having its leader again", Pelta remains optimistic two days before what could be the defining day of his career as an official.
Raj has promised that under him, the FACR will work hard.
If the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic were elected at the general meeting on Thursday, the current vice-president Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be happy.
Rajchl promises to work hard if he is elected.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I'd like to focus on football as a whole".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth football".
"I'm not saying that I'm doing everything myself", Rajchl said in an interview with CTV.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the responsibilities on the executive committee so that each member is focused on a particular area".
"And I will hand out hard tasks to move the football one step ahead in each of these segments".
"I think a lot of people would be unhappy because it would be about working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
He said that because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every move", he explained why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because then others would give up too".
"That's a trust I can't just throw away", he said.
He says he's also motivated by continuing the work he started with Hašek.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away now".
"There are processes that have been started that will have an impact for a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that if the next candidate, Miroslav Pelty, is elected, the situation in the union could return to the time before the Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta knows".
"He is especially favoured by those who would make football a privilege for the chosen few".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I can't be blamed for being partial".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to do football for everyone because then everyone will be happy and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be a Czech chairman.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I plan to do the best for Morava".
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league".
"This would have prevented the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Plzeň club Tomáš Paclík has also joined the fight for the presidency, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees that I have clear successes", said Rajchl, who credits his successes with saving tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
Instead, he blames himself for the fact that the union is not working together.
While he declares that Peltá is "disqualified from restoring confidence in Czech football", the other of his rivals, Paclíka, is considered a strong candidate with football to offer.
"No one can deny that he did a great job in Pilsen that year".
"If he had been elected, he would have continued the work that Ivan Hašek started here and would not have changed the personnel of the committees in any way".
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage", says rival Rajchl.
The Most Beautiful Pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
The first is that
The spa at Ufon, the luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Travellers in Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after sightseeing or traveling, let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book shows where the water wells are the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder set out on her explorations a year and a half ago, her suit of clothes was not to be missed.
Lying a little on the water, she looked up at the artistically shaped domes, swam across the marble putti (positions of a naked boy, child (with wings)), waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored secessional baths.
If she liked a flower shop, she would quickly record it in her notebook - along with remarkable details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 floaters have been explored by the architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her newly published book 'Badefreuden': the Folk Floaters in Munich, the historic float palaces in the Schwarzwald, the 'hard core of concrete buildings' in Taunus.
13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the swimming culture.
With sports, he says, it's not much of an exaggeration - only in the water it's something else.
The only irritating thing is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of pine forests or listen to the merry chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools had to be so ugly", says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming trunks".
The water level doubles the architecture
The plunge in the diving pool and the sauna essential oil - the comfort factor is so great that it affects all the senses, so much so Mrs. Meder.
And when founders try, the floating baths can be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of floors, you have a bath in the surface of the water".
"It's transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is optically doubled: the high arch, the colorful fireplace, the jumping board.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" (The Joy of Bathing) contains 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of the Plovdiv family, Mrs. Meder, during her search in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in the original karstic cave (the cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and in thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
The many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer a wonderful view of the city from the rooftop pool in Zurich, while the outdoor pool in St. Anton offers a view of the snow-covered Arlberg - and: The steam baths have a window that allows you to observe the movement of the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
The three open basins on the mountain in winter are steaming with steam rising as the Ötztalu Mountains rise to the sky in the background.
The Alhambra in the Schwarzwald
Not every float has a swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder smell of chlorine in the nostrils.
Many thermal baths have a sulfur smell, and the Árpád Baths in Békéscsaba, Hungary, smell of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that one has been in a thermal bath.
The smell comes from the healing water, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as you step into the pool - a rather peculiar wellness experience.
But Iris Meder's search for a nice spa was disappointed in one place too: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the baths designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic were closed.
As Mrs. Meder looked out through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Secession building, she saw the weeds growing enormously between the tiles.
The two of them faced each other in the magical swimming pool of the Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date from the time of its construction in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite bathing place of the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, and not only because she comes from the Schwarzwald.
"It is quite an achievement to combine such a variety of building materials into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
With a palace like this, a dip in a thermal pool seems like a marginal affair.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is having commodities trading audited
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank abandon its business with agricultural commodities?
SPIEGEL-ONLINE reports that Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor of the world.
Then in January, the CEO wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg - The
For the German people, the picture is clear: according to one study, 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate in agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even demand that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions pull out of the deal because it deepens the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey by Force commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices upward, and that the banks are therefore complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also taking similar action.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have been distracted from supply and demand - and profiting at the expense of the poor.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and saying that no deal was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation on the line".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is reviewing the Foodwatch-Report report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - together with recommendations on how to deal with it.
The bank officials want to announce the consequences of the decision by the end of January.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trading or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report but intensified his criticism of the financial industry: "The bet on rising food prices shows especially drastically how ruthlessly banks are damaging the general welfare today".
Let Ackermann, as the bank's top lobbyist, be held to account.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items that use money for food price bets", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned about the starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's vision may seem surprising at first, but it is clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors will not be joining the supervisory board, unlike planned.
By steering clear of the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about any possible losses - that's something that should be handled by his successor eventually.
Every second one of them would have given up on their investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on November 7 and 8 among 1,001 people.
Accordingly, just 11% consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments involving food price betting.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, as a result of the survey, abandon all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would warn their acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing their account and moving to another institution.
A 21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion moved
I 'm not going to be able to do it .
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won awards, became a museum in Vienna, and remained empty and inert.
Now it's reopened as a show house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, with its bright forms, glass halls, bold strokes and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition of 1958 is a striking and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and imposing steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the Austrian pavilion for the next World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus the key made by the side building in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building after the World Exhibition, was placed in the Schweizer Garten at Vienna's Südbahnhof (Southern Station), reconstructed and opened in 1962 as the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls to hang art exhibits, no climate to accommodate.
It was used until contemporary art found a new home in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more dilapidated.
Now the pavilion has been reconstructed by the architect Adolf Krischanitz, now it bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a happy intention in every way.
A new beginning was made by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a prominent art historian with a distinguished career, including as a young skating wrestler, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, pushed the reconstruction heavily with politicians and memorialists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and identified uses.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotrub should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be established, and an office building should be built.
Tight surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was the perfect cast for the role.
Not only because he had sensibly reconstructed and expanded the Secession buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he had studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where he viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design and the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and changed its use.
The current reconstruction had far greater problems: The building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The glass façade window profiles were replaced, the glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
The cold steel bridge beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings were repaired.
Two underground floors have made room for the new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost new construction, but still a magnificent Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is exactly the same as it was before.
All this under strict heritage supervision and a low budget.
"Often, a material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked the monument office", says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Through all the pressures, the challenges, and the renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficulty was with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-story".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet "to build up proper self-confidence".
But in this case, the 21st Century House is not in the wrong place, because an urban lucky coincidence has happened: In the circuit around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City District at the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is emerging.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another of Krischanitz's buildings, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and is reportedly already negotiating with the city about a neighbourhood in the Schweizer Garten.
The railroad is planning a winter relief package worth millions .
The railroad has developed a contingency plan to prevent train outages during the winter season.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It's going to cost millions.
To combat winter-induced train delays and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper 'Bild' provided a preliminary report referring to an internal group plan that said that a total of around EUR 300 million was expected to be invested by 2015.
It is said to help improve the use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
The plan is to double the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 for the removal of snow from railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to clear the platform before the start of operations and to clear 90 per cent of the snow and ice needed for the four to five hours of operation of the shuttles.
Two months ago, the head of the railway, Rüdiger Grube, warned after a high-level meeting with government and industry representatives of train failures and delays also during this winter.
The passenger traffic on the line suffered from considerable problems in the winter of last year, due, among other things, to the lack of reserves in the difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railroad Administration.
In addition, there are delays in the departure of ICE trains
The railway has also been unable to cope with the fact that ICE train axles have to be inspected more often by the workshop, after the axle of an ICE train at Cologne Central Station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the U.S.
After the uproar over the boss Josef Ackermann, there are new trampolines in the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of dollars in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in the sector has also caught up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (106 million euros) in one settlement procedure to settle the bankruptcy disputes of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage bonds.
The NCUA, the regulator of the financial markets, blames a number of large banks for luring cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced risk.
Such securities lost much of their value during the crisis, taking the banks down with them.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the matter without having to drag the parties to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank settlement does not admit any guilt.
That includes Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz has welcomed the accommodation of both MFIs.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the authority for cooperative banks in the US and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The settlements now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took on other major banks, and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage-backed securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events of the past few years, the wind is now blowing sharply against the banks.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous lawsuits to rectify or punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It blames 18 major international banks for the two state-owned American real estate firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's mortgage business, which has been at a disadvantage of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a FHFA lawsuit, which involves a series of transactions totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority asks the Frankfurt office to answer for 'substantial losses', without specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it wished to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is going into IBM with 10 billion.
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
He's bought over $10 billion worth of stock since March.
The great American investor Warren Buffett has always said that he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he's read the IBM business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was mainly offering services and purchasing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investments are considered a knight's errand in the financial world.
As a result, the parent company of IT IBM can now be called 'Sir IBM'.
Because Buffett revealed on CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, became one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM didn't even know about his involvement.
He praised management for trying to keep even a decent profit during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said of strategy.
IBM has long been investing in lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The 100-plus-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies until now.
He claims to only invest in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett went after the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the production machines.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and holds stakes in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over a small textile company in the 1960s, Berkshire Hathaway, and built it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with his wise investments.
Yet, his way of life is modest.
It has become a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His near-infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became public, IBM stock went up 1% before the stock market opened.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a market value of over $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, but he wouldn't want to join.
The founder, Bill Gates, is said to be a close friend of his.
The Danger Is Tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media has doubts about the German rule of law.
The newspapers even speak of "bloody ideology" now being revived.
The murders of eight Turkish-born small businessmen and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news was met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this is a return to a specter long considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, there was never any doubt about it.
But the newly discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a dimension whose dimensions have long been unseen.
"Bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" however, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the department for the protection of the constitution and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with caution: It commemorated the weekend of demonstrations by silencing the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish conscription agreement.
A life together was staged in cheerful colors - as a success story.
The box is filled with news from several Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifties" is the headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet cannot fail to make this connection.
"It's Starting to Stink", is the title of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made important contributions to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical discussion on German-Turkish Internet forums is the police's approach and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically ready to use drastic measures: "If the activities here continue to be carried out so superficially, the immigrants will have nothing but their own defense and armament".
"That's probably the best defense".
"The quality of the explanation and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network are very much dependent on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What this means if internal peace in Germany is threatened is made clear by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen crematorium is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and alienation can result in right-wing violence.
But the attacks have made a more visible sense of reciprocity on the part of the Turks.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The main criticism in the Turkish press at the time was the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkeel - Kinkel, in his speech, calculated the fees paid by the Turks.
It's almost as if a man's worth is measured by his tax dollars.
The current coverage in the Turkish media shows once again how deeply distrusted many German Turks are of the Turkish legal order.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reassess right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The scandalous bank on Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
Now some German's gonna fix it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
Following his noisy departure from the Federal Bank, it became known in July 2013 that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job: chairman of the board of Swiss giant UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praising Switzerland for both its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turning point".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September, it was clear that things were going to turn out differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS, Oswald Grübel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of UBS has since been replaced by a shadowy figure, and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already become known that Weber is allowed to advise the bank as of February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board in May - not in 2013 as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's more like a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he'd certainly need some time to get used to it.
Naráz then takes over the responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proven itself worthy of the title "The Bank of Europe's Biggest Scandals".
Because UBS is both huge - until recently the largest asset manager in the world - and it's been slipping from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid but also shrewd asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a mark in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 managed $1.6 trillion more of its wealthy clients' money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it's become an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker and later longtime Zurich banking professor Hans Geiger relates: "I always gave UBS as a model of a good bank to my students back then".
"In retrospect, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'"
He was wrong.
In 2007 it became clear for the first time that something had gone terribly wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the chairman of the board, Peter Wuffli, who was considered to be a highly intelligent and also a genius banker, resigned.
A few months later, it was obvious why he had left.
The bank's investment division was wasting subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To ensure this, UBS had approved a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, but investors that it would have been hiding from until recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet that one couldn't even name it.
But that was only the first blow.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
Disaster struck in October 2008: UBS was on the verge of collapse because of its investment failures during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the State.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problem securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in convertible bonds, which could have made it a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shaken - because it realized how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
The Commission notes that the capital injections were made in the form of a capital injection of EUR [0-5] million in the form of a capital injection of EUR [0-5] million.
"Once again we could not save UBS", says banking expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated to its tax dispute with America and expressed willingness to release the data of wealthy clients who, if possible, helped the banks to evade taxes.
In addition, it has agreed to pay $780 million in restitution for the unlawful profits of these deals, including the fine.
UBS thereby admitted more or less openly that it had assisted in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
The resignation of the head of the board and the chairman of the board followed.
And an exodus of customer money.
So, in the space of a few months, the bank lost its credibility in two core business areas: investment banking for bad speculation and asset management for aiding tax evasion.
And just when things had calmed down a little bit, just when you thought UBS was back on its feet, here comes this unfortunate business anabazis: a single dealer has lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank has noticed that something is wrong.
And it's clear: the risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The Adobe case may have shown that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Institute of Banking.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot control risk".
But this was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become the guardians of the world's great wealth: no too great risks, but safety for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic the world collapsed.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for the exceptional quality of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - only a little bigger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rents of the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's are found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli's.
For centuries, it has been home to Swiss banks, from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The entrance to the reception hall of UBS is through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are huge leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo is a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of Swiss banking was suppressed or betrayed by the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He'd rather not have his name in the paper, but he ends up, like all Swiss bankers, doing business with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too big, he says - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
I guess the Swiss have nothing to say about that.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago".
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS transformed, bringing it high profits at first and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, disaster was evident.
"In the middle of it, the governing coalition of a small country of seven million people decided to launch the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the failing bank.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and kept growing.
It helped that the two distinct banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: one wealthy but dormant bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management, and a poorer but more internationally engaged bank.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers had a lot of money to play the big wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest man who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who runs around his stomach, who has worked his way up from banking".
But Ospel was relying on Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He probably thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragically, I suppose.
Pride came before a fall.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: "Drop Goldman Sachs from the throne".
Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a ranking that documents the success of banks at the time.
In it, UBS was trying to get the top spot.
She's already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock markets, she was playing the top game.
But the corporate advisors who were commissioned point out one weakness: In the international interest rate trade, in the language of the "fixed income" bankers, there seems to be a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has a gap in the American mortgage product.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that repackaged securities into American mortgages and passed them on - while also keeping its own risks.
Even when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the housing market was in flames, that's where UBS was buying", says banking expert Geiger.
As great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
Manager after manager had to leave when attempts to clean up were harder than expected.
The positions at UBS became a catapult seat and are still swinging today.
Whoever runs a big bank now has a job that's almost impossible to handle.
He must find a strategy for a bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea: end investment banking, concentrate on wealth management, return to Swiss roots.
That's as far as the bank is willing to go.
But investment banking is going to be hit hard, that much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss-Italian was only seen as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly split with its predecessor Grübel.
He's set to run UBS's business for the long term, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are down.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's he gonna do for money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he's only publicly said that he and his wife will find a flat in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe is weighing on the U.S. stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged American investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have the intended impact.

Industry in the 17 countries using the euro has reduced its output significantly and is preparing to end its boom.
The output of enterprises in September was 2% lower than in the previous month, Eurostat reported.
This has made investors in the US skeptical. "We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman, a senior executive at Goldman.
Europe may not recover from the recession as quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this view: he said in an interview with CNBC that it may not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it can to end the crisis.
So it's probably too soon for him to invest in European sovereign bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has boosted the stock price of a traditional company, and left it up against the trend during the first trading session by almost one percent.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, ravens are considered "problem birds": but experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to be removed from the cities.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quickly enough: Crows have been part of the city's landscape for centuries, yet in some towns and cities, complaints about filth and noise from the animals are mounting.
Yet, no remedy for "problem birds" has yet been found.
Crows may not be able to leave cities, say experts at the first crows symposium in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Conservationists have also attributed the problems of cities to the exodus of specially protected wild ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The persecution, increasing construction, and the cutting down of typical nesting trees make life difficult for the birds.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies of over 600 nesting pairs are found in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer, among others.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to kill crowds in a rural county made negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals into bird traps and the beating of the sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, intimidation, nothing to gain", so much did the urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer discover.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting and moving to other places".
The only exception to this is hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them".
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive habitats and luring them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who said that the best way to deal with animals is to "get a little bit of a facelift".
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Training Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide lessons on the life of the highly intelligent field raven.
I heard the project has already been taken over by tourists.
Mrs. Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "It's all about the volume of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: The ravens do not merely use a tool to reach their meal, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of four field ravens to see how far birds' intelligence ranges.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones had to cause the structure to collapse in order to reach the moth larva.
Without much training, they learned what size and shape a rock had to be to cause a platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In the vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a mole larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their teeth.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From these, all four animals formed hooks, which they used as bait to catch the vessel from the tube for the holder.
Three of the four ravens even made it with the stakes.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting for Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks were not dashed.
Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are the favourites to take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.

The Czech Republic had to settle for a 1-0 result in the play-off against the outsider Montenegro, when the first game was already a clear thing.
Croatia didn't even give up a goal with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a free-kick with 1:0 against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) also scored for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvzestane Misimovic converted a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia already lost in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal got off to a great start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo quickly took the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 yards into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in the long-range shooting and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who had been inactive in the first half, had their first clear shot at goalkeeper Edina Dzekova.
The former Wolfsburg player from England, leading the table of the Manchester City club, placed the ball with his head on the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, in the center of the court, was Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the other side, Stark executed a controversial penalty kick after Fabio Coentra's action, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion made all that clear with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
And with that, the 1976 European Champion is off to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Norimberk) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented a possible own goal by Tomáš Sivok (9.) at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the penalty area just outside Chekhov's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already downed goalkeeper of the world-class Czechs, again lowering the striker FC Soul (50.
Branka finally clarified everything just before the end.
Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go over 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to vacate his place on the third-place bench at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can look forward to its fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience a near-fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot, and Kazim could not get the ball in the goal.
After that terrible second, Croatia took control more and more.
Also, after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
Besides Mario Mandzukica from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute, the legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Mnichov) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had made it 4-0 in the first game, to a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) has settled for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defence prevent a possible leading goal.
But in the 32nd minute, it was quite far.
After a poor defense by goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

A Massacre on a Personal Level
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a list of characters that makes you dizzy.
A word of advice for the moment: carefully tear out this page and make it a backup.
You will get to know all the characters in Mr. Englund's novel very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - a beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He's also the new vice-president of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "an anti-historical work".
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties, and famous battles, but it is almost devoid of ambassadors, energetic journalists, and discussions of tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as "a book about what it was like".
"Beauty and the Sorrow" combines the wartime experiences of 20 more-or-less dozen men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and civil servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go insane, or die.
Their lives are like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones added to the web of destiny while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classical historical novels.
It dispels the notion that World War I was all about the horrifying trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where the war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book, the soldiers deal with the problems of being hit by a beehive, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or dealing with the presence of tsetse flies.
It's a very moving read almost from the beginning.
War will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina with the stench of gunpowder.
When the cannon fire starts in the distance and you're a woman at home with your children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming, anyhow?
Almost no one understands what is happening, or even why the whole war has been started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts", Mr. Englund observed, "was filled with conjecture, conjecture, hope, fear, prejudice, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and the Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other published material.
Their life stories may sound terrifying and fascinating, but the inclusion of minute moments and details make them vivid and believable.
Many of them are about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Substitutions, substitutions everywhere".
"Coffee embossed, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, and wooden buttons". That's what I was thinking.
He goes on to describe food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "rice pressed in sheep fat (with a fake wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, wooden-soled shoes".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for sausage and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in himself an inner urge to savagery and brutality, and declares of war: "You will at last understand that this is human nature, not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, or an evening paper or a good book, and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that behind that starched self there is no barbarian lurking within".
The British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
"When one is finally willing to make a sacrifice, one would at least expect it to be in front of an appreciative audience", he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict being secretly hanged".
Other comments relate to the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition and a competitive battle", Mr Englund writes, "a war between factories".
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: the eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in tailored dresses who carries out his bloodbath without leaving his table".
People are acting out of the blue, and meanness is being replaced by heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes to avoid the front.
"The most egregious example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed on their genitals in the hope that it would end up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate were rubbed in the eyes, often blinding them for the rest of their lives".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is lively but not flashy, which fits his human theme perfectly.
In dozens of small-scale broadcasts, he records how the war "brought out forces that were completely out of control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on the First World War tended to be allusions rather than complex narrative, such as Paul Fussell's "The First World War and Modern Remembrance" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "On the Western Front Calm".
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most devastating ending in popular science literature.
I'm not going to tell you.
But you'll feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped a page out of your list of heroes and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time a minute-long, precisely-planned raid.
Hundreds of police officers participated, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were told at first that it was a training exercise.
The action was spearheaded by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the many challenges the police department had to face in the operation.
We must not repeat the cases of the last few weeks, when pepper spray was used against demonstrators, breaking the rules of the department and the wave of public sympathy poured into the squatters.
That's why the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and training.
The executives were inspired by the operations taking place in other cities.
A massive emergency behaviour exercise was held on the Randalls Island side, in preparation for the Zuccotti Park event.
Officials have stepped up so-called riot-suppression training - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid deployment of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the urban area of Lower Manhattan.
The final part of the training took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park came literally "at the last minute", said someone who was initially told the move was just a "drill".
"We know a few police officers who were called in on the action, and they were not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that he was going to Zuccotti Park".
Part of the reason for the secrecy was a lesson the town had already learned.
On October 14, city officials were scheduled to clean up the park, but then backed off the plan because, as soon as the protesters heard about it, they were surrounded by hundreds of them before the operation began.
Tuesday's action involved police from various units, including task forces from around the area - dozens of police officers who are routinely used to reinforce high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, the park is filled with people coming and going, so one o'clock in the morning was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there are as few people in the park as possible", he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, with emergency trucks carrying arc lamps and amplifiers.
The light and the recorded message from the amplifiers frightened many of the demonstrators.
As the members of the security forces entered the park in their blue windshields, many of the protesters packed their bags and left.
Police say they didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police have been seen gathering at the edge of the park to break in if arrests are needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their own safety.
However, many journalists feel that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing the police in action, and some police officers have treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that the Church Street TV cars running along the western boundary of the park could film without problems.
Police marched westward, interspersed with a dense web of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the sanitation department, who quickly swept away what was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged from the park, and documentary footage was posted online shortly afterwards.
The most active group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen of their campsite, which lay near the center of the park.
Some of them created a roadblock and the police began to arrest them methodically.
About ten people in the center of the campground were strapped together.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "organizing riots and resisting arrest", he explained.
The highest ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the police department, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the management of the operation", Mr. Browne said.
The second group of officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case there was a need to call it in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these locations, the police have developed a security zone further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of them armed with shields, were seen pushing people farther across the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest action of the night was south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., a protester south of Pine Street was seen leaping onto the hood of a police van, and several others were seen blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of tile flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The auxiliary workers union is suing the city for layoffs
Unions representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
A lawsuit is probably the last option left for the unions in District Council 37 in their quest to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, 672 school assistants, parent coordinators, and other employees, some of the city's lowest-paid employees, were fired, described by union leaders as retaliation for the city's denial of access to a workforce-managed health care fund last spring that the city was using to fill a budget gap.
City officials have flatly denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Secretary of Education Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One board member immediately countered that the budget made no specific reference to layoffs of support staff.
District Council 37 officials announced that they had completed the necessary paperwork and warned the Education Department that they would be suing the district, and they are holding a press conference Wednesday to formally announce the suit in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
The defendants in the suit will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore will not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by The New York Times, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor neighborhoods to support their claims of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more staff because they have been denied adequate funding for a long time.
They point out that while no redundancies occurred in the Staten Island school district and minimal in the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants were laid off in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and as many as 46 assistants were laid off in South Bronx in District 8 and District 9.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, even though the school is one where 68 percent of the students live in poverty.
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates bonus funds for each poor student it enrolls.
The unions, among other things, allege that high school principals may have been confused by the way the document approving the firing of the parent coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parenting coordinators were fired", the complaint says, "and not merely moved to the database for available positions".
Mission accomplished, Congress is ready to accept the Libyan settlement.
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Congress are agreeing on something regarding the Libyan uprising.
But before that could happen, the revolution had to succeed, the long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops had to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on a statement endorsed by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) congratulating the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking American troops for their "bravery".
"With this declaration, we want to recognize the courage of the people of Libya who have embarked on the rebuilding of their country", Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic aspirations".
The sentences may seem innocent, but no debate that has touched Libya has been easy.
Over the summer, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle argued incessantly with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of statements approving or rejecting the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of the differences between the two political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the House rejected the bill, the House also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding American operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in Libya literally in a legislative purge - Congress criticized the way President Obama was running the mission, but apparently the members of Congress were not so incensed that they stopped supporting him in his actions.
Eventually, the enthusiasm of the congress was overtaken by other events.
Rebels captured Tripoli in August, and on October 20th, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The International Relations Commission, in its statement, "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in the effort to liberate their people" and "commends the men and women of the United States and allied armed forces who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The statement also "affirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new proposal get the full backing of the International Relations Committee, or will lawmakers be split again, as they were when they approved the June proposal?
The latter was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar, the main Republican on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he hasn't seen the final version of the new bill yet.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for almost every Republican and Democrat in Congress.
The measure, championed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other issue to be voted on by the full House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far, despite considerable efforts, failed to get their proposals through to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that have been introduced in Congress and that have touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same bill before the House and the Senate - and some were minor variations on others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendment and a handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the bills are identical, but their proponents - especially the fledgling Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship".
The budget adjustment bill, which was approved in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms that congressmen can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that a president can serve.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (Ill.) proposed a series of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the amendment banning burning the state flag remain in place.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they are not significantly off the average compared to previous years.
They offered 77 amendments in the 111th Congress, compared to 66 in the 100th Congress.
Their activity pales in comparison to the early 1990's, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than our politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated", says Gifford in her first televised interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being shot at close range by a gunman at a public meeting of voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords of Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, singing along to the tune of the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", declaring that she wants to heal more than return to Congress.
Giffords appeared on ABC News's "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear that she was still struggling with her sentence structure and needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessitated by a bullet wound that fractured her skull in the front, penetrated the left side of her brain, and her head came out the back.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House to triumph over the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, the forty-one-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long "20/20" special broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
Specialist has been following Gifford's recovery since the shooting on January 8th.
The videos that Kelly shot during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can do no more than lift a finger or two during that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair with therapists teaching her how to perform simple tasks.
The nodding.
Lip-swelling.
And then, her first word: "What".
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" - when she demanded changes to her breakfast.
ABC videos show that music played a key role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings along with her therapist to the melody of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
During the interview, Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she had no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that he read Gifford the newspaper reports about the shooting until March 12th, when she first asked him who the six people killed in the incident were.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri state prison, where, under the influence of a violent drug, he is awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Horrible, horrible, horrible" is what I'm saying.
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point during his recovery, his wife said, "I lost".
"So I told her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly described.
"You just got a beating.
But you'll make it, you'll pull through, and you'll come back stronger than ever".
Military units meet with more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala night that raised millions of dollars for New York's homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in their formal attire stood up and clapped enthusiastically.
"The men and women serving in the military were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The ceremony was attended by the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units in a somewhat different way.
"They were all introduced as some orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was pity.
Such starkly opposed impressions only illustrate the fraught relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is awash in praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise is worth something, say the soldiers.
The public is acting more and more like they feel sorry for the uniformed man.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some people can support us is by putting us in the role of unhappy souls".
This is a very sensitive issue for military commanders who don't want to seem ungrateful or to damage their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Marc Cancian were returning from combat duty as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by people outside the military.
From the perspective of some, he will feel awe and awe, for having defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the surface there is a vicious, violent veteran", said Cancian, who served in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a government post.
He said that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were tacitly suggesting that he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from the war.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to expect negative reactions", Cancian taught his sons.
The military's dissatisfaction is partly due to America's indifference to war.
Battlefield successes are rarely appreciated in a country that has little awareness of its own military and little of its own in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was common during World War II", declared Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are decorated for the number of actions they endured, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a decision will be made as to whether to bring 28 women and men to trial against the military for allegedly failing to act in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to sue.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was allegedly raped by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego, and after dinner with a friend, she came upon a male colleague carrying a case of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her for a drink in her room.
"A warning light went off in my head", Lyman described.
But the native Texan ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19".
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I had followed my instincts".
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked up to her, threw her on the bed, and raped her.
This week, November 18th, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will be awaiting the verdict of a potentially historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, on whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is a violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
The charges were filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff group at the time had 17 members, but in the months that followed, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the military, after reporting the attacks, failed to investigate, punish or any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's going after the highest military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The military is a directive system", he says.
"Who are the people in a position to prevent the effort to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Rather than lump all the charges into one case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will pursue multiple cases if the pressure is to keep up.
The defense team for the Department of Defense is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense's strategy - essentially, that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court ruling known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs' military service", the document reads.
The Department of Defense has declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950's.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, it's a play on words: in modern warfare, it's hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: Between those wars, 150 female soldiers died - two thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to modernize, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and there are three other attorneys working on the case.
At Yale Law School, attendees of the Veterans' Legal Services Seminar are preparing to sue four major military academies for allegedly fostering a climate of misogyny.
A separate non-profit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military, which focuses on diagnosing "personality disorders" that were allegedly found in rape victims in order to give the military a pretext to dismiss them - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for negotiating with veterans, accusing it of discriminatory practices in processing requests for help from people who claimed they had been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and representatives from both political parties, proposing a range of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number represents approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
A report released in March also breaks down the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported to the military went to court - half the rate in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Deputy Burke's case describe the assault as just the first in a series of trauma.
Private First Class Lyman, for example, reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have occurred.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had all the tests necessary to establish rape, and the attacker's blood was found in her bed - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was in a court hearing during which she was questioned about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six witnesses were called to testify in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran screaming out of the courtroom".
"I was put in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his trial. It was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered her to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, thus rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged from the military and therefore without the right to parole.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs move to the next stage or not, it's a long race, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes, "From my perspective, they should be able to move on to the next stage of the negotiation".
But between them and the verdict stands the doctrine, which has been criticized since it first saw the light of day.
I myself have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their duties don't give them the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds: "The odds are heavily against them... but it's important for them to try".
Change will only come when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't decide in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will gather hundreds of other people ready to press charges and begin working on other cases related to this topic.
"We will continue to fight with the military on this issue, as long as there is no reform", he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists are studying you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who was presenting his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing spree that left 77 people dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social media pages.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists are eager to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - just go to the Facebook.
"We realised that it's not that hard to get them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a UK research team on digital populism in Europe.
The pool of personal information on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that it was enough for researchers to simply use ads on the site to pinpoint the target demographic with absolute accuracy - something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, and they targeted them and sent them ads, but instead of inviting them to the new group or offering them dietary products, they asked them to fill out questionnaires that asked questions about their level of education, their attitude to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, driven by rising immigration rates.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen".
The DEMOS team's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and policy researchers use these sites to study everything from health issues to social trends to hidden status updates, wall posts and clicked "like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users, each of whom provides an average of three pieces of data a day, making it a "information supernova" that is driving a lot of new research.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be that if you wanted to do a poll of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to get into a party that would never let you in", says Bartlett.
"Facebook is taking all of this down - you just go straight to them".
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify social health problems and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students who discussed their drinking habits on Facebook were much more likely to have a drinking problem than college students who were silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"You can't solve a problem if you can't diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the study with Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children that we wouldn't have had a chance to find otherwise".
Facebook itself is constantly probing its users' data.
The site's information team compiled statistics on the relationship of relationship status to Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction rate (mainly using information they had access to - advocates of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information available for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is tracking them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site must give their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules for how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
"I think most users didn't even think that scientists could look at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he did using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as a matter of information between themselves and their friends".
Next, the question of methodology is also to be considered.
Even when research is done offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There's no way to verify how much of the information on a profile and posts on a wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, feels that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tools to use in research.
"Going out into the real world and talking to real people is something that cannot be replaced", he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities -- and a hell of a lot of social activities still happen offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "warfighter" during his first public trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar", he declared before a courtroom of 500 people.
"I object to the court because you were given a mandate by an organization promoting a hateful ideology and because you promote multiculturalism".
"I confess my actions, but I do not confess any guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which he could state his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him from any contact with the media for 4 months, and announced that the competent authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was being held tight.
All of them attended with the goal of moving the case to a speedy closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", one of the survivors told NRK.
"It was not pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I was mentally moved a little further".
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, entering and leaving the building without difficulty, looking into the eyes of the journalists present and the survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For some, it may be a comfort that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that still exists in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a creature, but she doesn't", said a relative of one of the victims.
"If it were, everything would be so much simpler".
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in the movie heading to theaters this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, there were people who started comparing him to Henry Ford and voting him the greatest modern inventor because of his genius.
In a recently re-discovered interview with Jobs, which was taped for a special film that's heading to theaters this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind had a perfect understanding of the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was a brilliant designer, a dreamer, and a self-styled hippie, but he was also a pedantic organizer and a man who worked out every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered from "the notion that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] there's a long way between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of the Computer Fools, which was about the dawn of personal computers.
It was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, eagerly anticipating the Internet's adoption by the general public.
The TV show ended up using only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview, and the original copies of the interview were rumored to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This very material, slightly edited, forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone famously reluctant to give long interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about talking about his philosophy of technology and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there's a long pause between the question and the answer -- 10 to 15 seconds of thought, where you see Jobs perfectly think through the answer to be as precise and as accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringely's questions, and urges him to get to the more important problems and issues faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, and it's filled with eerily prophetic thoughts as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong, offering his own vision of the future in the computer technology field.
It's one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as an avid dreamer in the prime of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It was not long before, after he had expressed his thoughts, he began to put them into practice as well.
A quick summary of seven scenes from Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"In my years in business, I've always asked, 'Why do you do this?' and the answer has always been the same: Well, that's just the way it's done".
No one knows why they do what they do, never think deeply about business matters.
I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were being recorded - often starting with the words "standard costs", the amount of which he could only guess - and at that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that the business costs could be determined in a matter of moments.
How he did the Pope's roast:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
There's been a lot of writing about this device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally infectious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and allowed themselves to be switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've done this half a dozen times around the world, so that when we yell something on a pay phone, it rings a minute later from the other phone at the door", laughed Jobs.
"We were young and we realized that we could build a thing that could control a billion-dollar infrastructure around the world".
We made a little thing that could control a much larger giant, just the two of us -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would have ever been born without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke that he and Wozniak almost made, calling the Vatican in the middle of the night via the Blue Box, asking if they could speak to the Pope, best impersonating Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, senior members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they could wake the pope himself to the phone, the pair laughed and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and got on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a speedometer, he found Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's Palo Alto research lab, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with it instantly.
As a teenager, I was working my way up at HP, hanging around the computer, writing programs for it.
How he invents innovation:
In several of the interviews, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the run.
Early in his career, when he was trying to sell a couple of circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days in which to design, build and deliver the finished device.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing the computer mouse:
"I remember we had this really wild argument... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a $300 mouse], and I got tired of it, and I went out and found a designer".
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How the big companies are running out of breath:
Long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs had predicted with foresight that many of the industry's leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be a successful company.
By now, sales and marketing are in charge, so companies are run by people who are in charge of that, while people who are in charge of their own products are kept out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has brought the company to its unshakeable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could be 10 times bigger than it is, it could be the Microsoft of the '90s...
Instead of winning, they have earned the right to lose.
How to take innovation as an art form:
"There's a long way to go between a great idea and a great product... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and expands".
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a whole series of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories can't make you do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your mind all the time -- different concepts -- and put them together...
Ultimately, it's all about taste -- trying to think about the best things that humanity has ever created and trying to kind of project that into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh Company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked for it were the best musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally, the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technology, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with the opponents of the health care bill while their case was being heard.
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will be participating in the trial.
The event occurred last Thursday when all nine justices met to discuss the motions that were filed.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the appeal, but a five-and-a-half-hour hearing is expected in March, which will further complicate the presidential election scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the ruling.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and try to get the bill thrown out will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long been a champion of conservative legal principles.
The other company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which vast funds are at stake.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court hearing on the case.
Attending, among others, was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a staunch opponent of the health care bill.
And the guest introductions?
It's nothing new: these two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's certainly not about anything that violates the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the code of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
If this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which states that 'a judge may participate in events organised by related and other organisations for the purpose of raising funds, but a judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour or be featured on the programme of an event'.
Still, Scalia and Thomas' relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with huge financial interests in the case, was enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct contradicts the assertion of a few justices that the Supreme Court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges have been drinking and dining at social functions along with legal counsel awaiting their case before the court".
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this event undermines any claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they too had no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly-regarded conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is with Justice Elena Kagan, not with Justice Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was serving as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Critics of Kagan's pressing her to recant her involvement in the case, arguing that she was fighting the law too hard then to be impartial now.
Kagan has made no indication that she's going to resign.
Boeing has won a record $18 billion contract for jetliners
Emirates is ordering 50 twin-screw Boeing 777s with an option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it receives more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, it's usually not a cause for celebration.
But if that company is the Boeing Co. and the price of those 50 planes combined is a record $18 billion, that's another story.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in dollar value for commercial airplanes ever - 50 twin-engine Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Dubai-based Emirates airlines.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
Then on Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8 aircraft, sometimes called Dreamliners, which boast significantly improved fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total price tag of these six planes is over $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company", said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing nations.
That means not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly hurting airlines, because it's one of their biggest costs - is not as critical, because the country itself is making money off of higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay orders for aircraft due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection", he says.
The Emirates order consolidates Boeaing's leading position in the wide-body market and puts a strain on Airbus SAS, which had tried to undermine Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport aircraft.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be delayed.
The shift was caused by customers demanding greater payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
Boeing Co's share price rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president was apparently defeated in the election in Michoacan.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejo of the PRI, was helped in his bid for the governor's seat by drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderon, who appears to have lost the violent state election for governor of Michoacan, on Monday claimed that one of her opponents was aided in his victory by drug dealers.
Preliminary results have given Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the lead in the Western state gubernatorial election.
"The interference of organized crime in the electoral process and especially in the election yesterday is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country", said Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview the day after the election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... they confiscated the ballot boxes, they built roadblocks... and they made people vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
But he plans an early return to power, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems Vallejo has beaten Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, by a very narrow margin.
Calderon, the candidate of her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Third is Silvano Aureolis, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has held the governor's office until now.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, has denied any ties to drug dealers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and it was in Michoacán that he launched the military campaign against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew in fear.
But whatever the outcome of the Michoacán election may be for the PRI, a victory will help the party gain new momentum.
The PRI's presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallej from Washington, saying, "I think this victory could be very encouraging for the year ahead".
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be prepared to help the eurozone out of its severe debt crisis, otherwise a global downturn could occur that would negatively impact growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the Manila-based ADB's chief executive, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help speed up the recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European troubles "with too little interest" and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and resources would help to forestall a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is welcome", he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is certainly not immune".
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it".
The European Monetary Union has been severely tested for several months by the serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised concerns that the global economy could be plunged back into recession, and calls began to be made for the emerging major economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds by the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners in European countries greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have a tough job and we have to keep up the growth rate".
"It's not an alternative, it's a fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies such as India are not in a position to help European economies when they are facing serious economic problems of their own.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain European aid to India's 1.2 billion people, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find out that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain to them", he noted.
Lee Howell, the CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paying jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as railways.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatened a 'dangerous domino effect'.
The bank's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia for 2011/2012 now faces a "risk of slowdown" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must develop "unpredictable spending plans" to protect themselves from downturns and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was on the hook in Congress Monday when he warned that the looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields of Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next 10 years, but now it's worried about another $600 billion in cuts if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the entire resort", Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to agree on a budget and the resulting so-called "lockdown" will cause a 23% flat rate drop and the shutdown of many new projects.
"With such a huge cut, used in this reckless manner, it will not be possible to carry out most of our building or shipbuilding projects - you can't buy just three-quarters of a building or ship.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will almost certainly also have to put civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet target requirements".
"These changes could shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness".
Eventually, the cuts will affect combat units, Panetta said.
"While the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this shutdown, operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets", warned Panetta.
"There will be cuts in contract personnel, "which will result in delays in contracts "to support our people's war effort".
"Will reduce salaried staff, which will result in late payments to suppliers and consequent disruption of legal and political support".
Both senators wrote to Panetta ten days ago asking for details regarding the possible impact of the automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The fallout from the Department of Defense shutdown could cause a rapid degradation of the United States' standing as a world military power".
"We are strongly opposed to this harsh measure", the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign".
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, and we should not allow it".
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to pass a budget and amplify the voices calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of targeted areas.
Panetta has been more open about the possibility of cuts in recent talks, even though he's moved into his senior Pentagon position with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to have a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the Secretary of Defense hinted at a glimpse of what his department could expect - a shell of the military, but without a core.
"It will be like a ship without sailors".
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition".
"It's like the air force without trained pilots".
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission", said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"He will be like a unit without morale, unprepared and unable to face a possible enemy".
"As a result, it will welcome aggression from...
In the annex to the letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitation of the possibilities of deployments and deployments worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could be waiting to be completed, including those already being tested and those in the early planning stages.
The list included the F-35 project, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new land combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F-35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but advocates say it's a necessary next step in upgrading the military needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Tell When a Lie Is True
A glance at recent headlines reveals the seriousness and pervasiveness of lies and deception in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with accusations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to suppress a record of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on camera telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and destabilized many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing campaign funds to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that erupted around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating at school and university all over the place.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their own assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that you lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times a day.
Let's assume that many of them are charitable lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Detecting lies, or "detecting lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it's not a social game, like, say, a charade, where a person shouts, "I've got you". Deception detection is a serious branch of science, working with scientific data gathered over the last six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're snuggling, or making cocktails, or blushing, or getting tattoos.
But don't assume that liars are difficult to spot and detect.
A trained lie detector can detect the truth from sentence structure, subtle facial expressions, the way questions are formulated, and their timing.
I've spent years gathering scientific evidence from the vast and growing field of lie detection, and it's clear that deception detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and can help you a lot in today's complex world -- especially if your job involves hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing people.
Good liars can read other people, let them cool off in their vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively perceive how the other party is perceiving them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "other-centered" lies -- often to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less to their partners than single people (but the lies they tell are often "horrible").
We also know that if you're perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know when someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "initial observation".
It'll give him something to compare it to later.
Notice the subject's posture, his laugh, his voice work.
You should know if someone is habitually tapping their feet so that you don't falsely accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider these only warning signs, not proof of a lie.
People who tell a lie may stop moving their upper body as they try to remember their invented story, turn the tips of their shoes toward the door, lean out, change their posture significantly, or exhibit "after-conversation relief" - exaggerated relief breathing and a change of position when difficulty is behind them.
People who do interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see how much relief there is after the interview is over.
Also feel the subject's language.
There's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once crossed over and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals may also express themselves in a measured way: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question over and over.
The most common verbal signs are very minor.
One can use a lot of "softening language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge".
Such a response leaves much to be desired, and it is often another warning sign.
There is no spell that can expose every lie, but it is possible to develop skills that can detect a lie.
Such skills will help you to avoid being a liar and a cheater in your personal and professional life.
A controversial pipeline plan is being redirected after the threat of delaying US government approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - turning labor unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists - the company building the pipeline announced it was willing to re-direct the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska and is confident the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Statehouse.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even if it goes a different route.
This announcement comes after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a federal permit for a project to study alternative routes that would allow it to avoid encroaching on the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really a step forward", Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely delay any decision until 2013, a year after the election next year, but officials deny any political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
A 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil flowing from Alberta to the refineries in Texas every day.
We're gonna have to go through six states on this one.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created working on the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan and considered legislation to force the company to stay out of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the Department's inspector general had commissioned a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing on two issues.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's adviser in 2008, was a conflict of interest in the program.
It further questioned whether the company that was hired for the original study was not inappropriately chosen because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making the toddler throw up fear.
A New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter so bad she vomited in fear.
The Lady Marmalade hit singer's performance scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family claims in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan's highest court.
On November 10th of last year, stage tech Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family outing.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk took the luggage down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard home, taking Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter does?' I said 'yes' and went to pick her up".
LaBelle was angry and scolded the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter against the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
I told her, "I'm not interested in your opinion".
She became furious and began to speak foul words - shouting out loud the simplest expressions...
She had a water bottle and started pouring water on me.
She says Genevieve had a hysterical episode.
"I told the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter.' " The child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother, who was still holding Genevieve, and had to be stopped by her attendant, who dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
Meanwhile, the daughter was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter to LaBelle asking for an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit is asking for more vague damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all proceeds to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions", Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child".
Climate change has crippled the economy
During the first year of the government of María López Valdez, unemployment and insecurity increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined, and with it the economy
The year 2011 will be recorded in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of the government of María López Valdez, who calls herself the government of change, and brought with it high expectations for economic progress, but due to the adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was recorded and even the main indicators of economic development declined.
The low temperatures in February caused losses of millions in agriculture, limited the growth potential of the national economy, and were responsible for a decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first half of this year.
According to a damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of cultivated land were damaged, with 78.03% completely destroyed and 21.07% partially damaged.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population.
Less liquidity
According to Gerardo López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
"We are seeing rising unemployment related to a variety of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the limited resources due to the legislation passed by Congress in the fight against money laundering, and it is not easy for people who illegally take dollars to earn, invest or use them", he said.
Stopping the migration
López Cervantes said that demographic factors also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of the difficulty of entering and because even when they do, it is difficult for them to get jobs, so people stay and demand jobs from our state, and unemployment is rising", he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also worsened by the increasing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions.According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state work without paying benefits to the social security administration.
In addition to unemployment and unreliability, other characteristics of the labor market include low wages, which are the lowest in the country according to the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 also saw the biggest drop in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years.According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 in the January-June period, a decrease of 87,74% compared to $5,143,312 in the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government reports investments of PTE 17 280 million per year, mainly in service companies.
Debt and other liabilities
In a scenario of economic decline, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be allocated to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy.
Reaction
According to business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés showed a lack of government management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination of will between the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really modest this year, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, we have to double our efforts in 2012, there was a lack of harmonization of all our efforts and especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government, and we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Loredo López said events like the frost earlier this year had halted the state's economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic momentum was caused by a number of events, including frost, and one of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain the momentum needed to achieve acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefining the Mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally see that work is being done, we believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and the economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The Work Ahead of Us
The Coparmex Chairman stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the Government's efforts.
"Generally, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan", he said.
He said the current administration has shown progress in public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that there is work being done and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us", he said.
Convicted of eight kilos of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in jail for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically the possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military forces on June 7, 2010 while on a drive in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80 station in El Castillo, Navolata.
The dealer was driving a white pickup truck with a black bag in the trunk and a small backpack in the passenger seat, and the soldiers found eight kilos of marijuana.
For these reasons, the man in custody remains at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programmes such as Habitat, Save Public Places and 3x1 for migrants are in danger of not being completed or of being delayed because of lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if the construction work has been going well so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to provide the necessary supplies, which require more than 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, 25% of which is owned by the state, and that until now only the Federation and the city have provided the funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"Almost 12 million has to be secured and although the year is coming to an end, we have received nothing at all, even though we should have received some in July", he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started projects and are continuing very well, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not met the corresponding deliveries, and therefore, at the beginning of the new term, the city had to apply for a loan to be able to pay more than 7 million that the state administration had not given them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went ahead.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from the state representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armando Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance, to speed up the process and the corresponding percentage to arrive as soon as possible.
"We were supposed to get 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we still haven't gotten a peso".
Court approves "end of analog broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that aims to accelerate the so-called "deactivation of analogue signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juana Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority when he issued a decree outlining the steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
The action brought by the Senate was dismissed as a result, since the qualified majority of eight votes required to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question was not obtained, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero, proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
The only people who voted for the project were Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure through general standards measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, noting that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, related to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, as digitisation is not only technical but also 'concerns economic, social, political and national security issues'.
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfered with the area of congressional jurisdiction, to introduce into the area of administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán, they're analyzing the possibility of a voice-by-voice count.
According to the PREP data, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is less than 27 percent, and 879 of the 6,074 precincts have not yet been counted.
The "vote by vote" option emerged in this year's election in Michoacán, where according to the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is less than 27 percent, and 879 votes out of a total of 6074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of measures to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially ratify its political constitution, nor its State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadline set by the Law of the Official State Gazette, saying that he had some objections against them.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the vote of the head of state on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "approve or veto".
Asked about the possibility of counting "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for the partial and total counting to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial counting of one or more ballots will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not match; there is no record of the vote count and the calculation in the relevant box or the President does not have it available; or there are errors and obvious irregularities in the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request is made at the beginning of the session by a representative of the party and/or coalition that has proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recount may also be carried out if, after a proper count, the difference between the likely winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, and whenever there is an explicit request from the second-placed political party, in which case the ballots for which a partial recount has been carried out shall be discarded.
It should be noted that this is the situation in the elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament.
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortes were transported to Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, with a solemn ceremony and funeral mass on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane, where they and their closest friends attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel located in the street Nazario Ortiz Garza, where also came family and friends.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school technologists and members of the football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a member during his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinama mountains, as he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his game, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, son, a loving brother who lived for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo at a very young age and entered the Colegio del Aire flying school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he had just arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to attend his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
They said their last good-byes
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, senior officials and students of the Technological High School of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died days ago after the helicopter he was piloting crashed, with the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people on board, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of Bacio Cortés, a native of Saltillo, arrived (crucified) to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez, in the square, where in the meantime the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found at the estate of Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 individuals who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men, shot in various parts of their bodies and heads, were found in an abandoned farmhouse in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find was made on a mile of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved around these places noticed that the beige-coffee-fence cottage had its door open from time to time.
When they looked in from a distance of about ten feet, they saw three bodies, so they alerted the authorities immediately.
One person was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing a boot, and next to him was another person in a white striped sports shirt.
A few yards away, the body of another person was found, wearing a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the information obtained at the scene, all three people were probably murdered in another place, because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the hut, messages were found addressed to one organized crime group by another, as well as a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were arrested
The Secretary of National Defence has identified 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group operating mainly in the Cadereyta area and linked to kidnappings, murders, persecutions and illegal burials.
According to the information published, in the first attempt on November 11th, in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detainee was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid occurred at 6 a.m. on November 12th, when military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they spotted a car without a life jacket and two people inside.
When they stopped the car, they searched it and found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds.
Then, based on these testimonies, on November 13th, at around 2 pm, one of the accomplices was arrested in the area of La Frauda, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burial in the communities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will confront the crisis that has kept this country above the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government to face the crisis that has kept this country from the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a statement announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to form a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were being overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual, while Italy struggled to combat the political and financial crisis that had driven its debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders, the only way to restore Italy's battered credibility.
Monti is under a lot of pressure to hurry, because of the volatility of the markets, the interest rates on Italy's 10-year BTP bonds have exceeded the 7% threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this predicament.
Monti's hopes of success have been boosted by the support of the PDL's Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to be successful", Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now, a number of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government formed by Monti.
Support to Parliament
Monti's new government must have strong support in parliament to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacles or delays in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations.
The round ends Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who has made very rapid progress in responding to the crisis.
After a brief dip late last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields have returned to critical levels, reacting to uncertainty about the new prime minister's success.
Bailing out Italy, whose public debt is 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the capabilities of the euro area's current financial reserves.
Monti has said that his government should stay in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that politicians will give him time only to implement reforms and then call early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to get Italy out of the predicament the country is in because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to integrate both the government and the political establishment.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will cross the 50 international mark.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the 50 game mark.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare the 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the World and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a wide range of mid-table A matches to their name, Costa Rica's only defender is Michael Uman, who has the distinction of being the only player to have played 50 international matches.
He reached that mark last Friday against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star Game and in the powerful clubs of the English first league, maintain an intense activity for over a year in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League.
To this we must add the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited options for foreign matches in the region, for example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest number of international appearances for the Spanish national team is on the account of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) overtook former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international appearances.
Casillas will play Costa Rica again today and set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player for Barcelona, has 106 matches to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week, along with other Spanish players who have a hundred games to their name, including the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's centre-forward Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol is also close behind with 97 matches.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Uman, left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only five other players have made the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are also among the players who have been selected for the club.
The national under 30 team is led by Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even make 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to deliver one of the greatest concerts of all time at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've waited over 20 years, but the band themselves assure us that for them, the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is on the South American continent on their 20th anniversary tour and on Sunday the 20th, they will make a unique stop in Central America.
This day, he will perform from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium with the angel group The X and the national musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true, Pearl Jam will be playing in Costa Rica, do you realize what your fans are going through?
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream come true.
We've been to South and Central America twice, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're very excited to bring our music to you.
I ask because they love the band here, and the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most ardent supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been created in a matter of weeks.
We've put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that'll get us into shape for the Costa Rica show.
We're actually looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle, and for both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its surf-worthy waves?
We have a lot of fellow surfers, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends go to Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico to surf, and those are the best places to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
Looking at your tour, you put on a great show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can do.
We're gonna try to put on a show that's as diverse as possible, and we're gonna try to play a couple of songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good, diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why would I do that?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have a song or two in our repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on it and we're surprised because we remember why we liked it so much and maybe we've forgotten about it.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour is celebrating 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe all that you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you do.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much power we've been given and it's touching that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to see the places we've always wanted to see.
We couldn't have landed better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the birth of the grunge genre?
We've always been honored to be part of a group that's represented by all the greats.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising that when a movement starts from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
Occasionally, a group may form in a city, but it is much less common for five or ten groups to arise from one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them sometimes.
Last year we went to the festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're lucky to have all of them as friends, and we're honored to be a part of this movement that's been born in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is already much longer than the usual length of a band.
I think that, first of all, we're all lucky to be alive, and secondly, it's important that we're all constantly interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and because of that, we've been able to open up musical pathways that allow everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you can do whatever you want.
How do you find balance?
As we grew older, it became progressively easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you've put into it, and you can't get carried away by being famous, by being a rock star, and none of us ever really cared about that.
What do you remember about the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and it was something spectacular in the beginning.
We'd been a band for three years and had never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we're still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out with us in the band, and when I hear a song or look at a picture, I remember Andy, how amazing he was, how I laughed with him, it was always a joy to work with him, to laugh with him, to talk about music or football and so on.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The National Band of Las Robertas will be commissioned to open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with some of the designs and we liked this group the most, so we're curious to see what Las Robertas have to offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
The first to attack me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... and the rest of the guys.
There are so many I could spend the whole evening talking about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge in the past?
I think we've all always felt a little detached from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I mean the bands I mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out around the same time, and if that's still the way music is today, that's a great thing, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
At first, your music was a little bit gloomy, but now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
It's interesting because I feel like there are some songs on the new album that are a little bit lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they can sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have some kind of trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to affect your art and your music, and those two songs are just that for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.

Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday for tests due to muscle loss in his lower extremities, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four surgeries and is currently under medical supervision.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days to determine why he is in pain and losing strength in his lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, however the former president himself does not want to be pardoned because he feels innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, lost 60 pounds [18 kg], and had other problems, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Directorate of Police Special Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by the illegal military assassination squad in the early years of his rule.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to expand trade between the two nations and touch on political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday, the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with political, business and Uruguayan community leaders in Mexico, the schedule was released by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy added the South American country to the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked a negative reaction from Uruguay and consultations with the ambassador in that European country.
Mexico has been the G20 chair since November, a group of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries, and has had an information-sharing agreement with Mexico since January of this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to concretise fiscal swap agreements in order to get off the "black list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a trade perspective, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber is running in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
For over 25 years, Super Mario has fought tirelessly to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to all retail stores worldwide this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how the stereoscope without glasses is supposed to work", said Omar Álvarez, a press officer specialising in Nintendo of Spain, during a presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this platform", because up to this point, successful titles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being a 3D movie, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and fluid gameplay experience.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you've passed this level, you can move on to the "second round" of the game's more challenging levels.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new entry in 3D also involves the return of Super Maria to the handheld console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the tune of the series' viewers, repeating the successful formula of previous installments, in which the bearded man's plumber must traverse dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds new moves, environments, disguises and enemies, the "playful" Luigi also appears.
Colom authorized the extradition of Portilla to the United States.
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to extradite former president Alfonse Portillo, who is being held in the United States for conspiring to launder $70 million.
This ends the process that was intended to get Guatemala to respond to the North's request for Portillo's extradition so that it could try him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, and that he remembers that the criminal court has already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he had "not interfered" in judicial decisions and authorized all issues that came to his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that prevented extradition, but the Justice Department appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijova has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The organization was created to help children without an education, to avoid being marginalized.
The first 25 years of Trinijov's existence are very important: 6,000 young people facing social exclusion have been helped, and the organisation has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long list of 100 jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary was also the occasion for presenting the balance sheet at a ceremony held in the former Fabra i Coats factory premises and attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployment, drug addiction or in situations where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of the organizations and institutions that have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified character of the work carried out by Trinijov.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujola, the ceremony was attended by the former Socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former Deputy Mayor and current Ecological-Socialist Councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Adviser for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General for Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also appeared in the large hall.
Mas said Trinijov was born in a very difficult time and that the present times also have a lot of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to the present day "is a good foundation".
The President cited Triniov as an example of how to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new to this organization and the work it does", he said.
There was an eviction of a foreclosed house that had been hosting gigantic parties
The intruders have taken over 11 of the 13 apartments in the Balmes, 51 building.
12 squatters left the house yesterday at noon, without resisting.
All signs point to the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street have been living through is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they were illegally staying and where they were hosting gigantic parties that were being thrown by neighbors, leaving the building by court order and without the need for police intervention.
After the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded", declared the caretaker.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, painted the walls, and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were used for huge parties that lasted up to two days and roused the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the period in which the building was occupied, sales dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco stresses that the occupants of the building were unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco costs 10.
In addition, the entertainment business owner had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, but the problems were caused not by visitors to the discotheque, but by the occupants of the house, and especially those who participated in the parties organized there, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even made a deal with the owner of the building and have been releasing her from her nine-month rent.
City police also confirmed that they've received several complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP's city group in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be evacuated immediately, and put an end to the problems of civic coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Council explained that only one floor had been taken last summer, but in recent months the occupiers had entered all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there had even been robberies.
In this regard, he added that "impunity must be ended and we must be consistent when it comes to acts of civil liability that have occurred in the building".
City police also evacuated a building in New Barris yesterday.
At 3:30 p.m., police were called to the 35 Mont-ral Street building by neighbors who had seen four people enter the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
The park or the mountains?
The architects have come together to draft a lawsuit that involves more than a controversy over the fee
The 16 gates municipal tender reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), which had already ceased to exist, the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to many people's minds as the upper limit of Barcelona, as the Catalan metropolis is one of the few that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, but up (up) - down (sea).
Qualifying Collserola as a nature reserve goes in that direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wild boars instead of the bear Yogi.
That was the position until September, when the City Council announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrances to Collserola.
The gate, of course, is more of a recording of the park's thoughts.
Either that, or someone's trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question is, Collserola, the park or the mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and from the reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all the Barcelona architects.
It's as hot a subject as when two members of this old caste of elected officials meet in an elevator and shake hands.
And it was this feat that produced one of the rare coincidences between the thinking of three Barcelona architects and the leading university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the Gulf side was discussed, "it is necessary" to discuss the "Mountain side", so Ildephonse Cerda's speech on green apples was not questioned until the end.
"We have to assume that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "Gates to Collserola" is a "lexicological trap": we must not think of them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a demarcation of zones where it is possible to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urban planning, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The danger of "the uncertainty that the public space project represents today", after the experience of the 1980s in the Forum area, which had "its song swans".
The first concern is the very definition of where to build.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, in principle, to go one step further.
"New urban planning and planning tools need to be kept in mind, as the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause a real disaster".
Looking at the question in more detail, Modol considers that the Collserola valley slope can be 'considered a park' but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola which 'must not end in a landfill', although he welcomed the fact that the municipality offered his council to intervene in the project 'from the very beginning'.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of gateway that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "he doubts" that it should be this technical profile that leads the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should be just tools".
Bayona suggests that the question that gave the name to the game is complicated because the selection criteria lack Collserola's global vision: "There have been 16 selection procedures covering all the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
That means that at least he signed up for all 16 auditions.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may conflict with the concept and definition of the architect of the next gate.
In his opinion, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should be provided with facilities along the whole length of the zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino has forgiven Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days in prison, the legal guardian Cadino Red granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal guardian of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the district, which was hearing a case of blackmail in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was accused.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos that had Manuel Jonas asking him to pay economic quotas to the city of Monterrey to allow the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry's Agent Number 3 for Property Crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained at this location for the next 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued and a Public Prosecution Service agent ruled out the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red for one and a half million pesos.
The authorities have allowed him to remain in the city cells of San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to allow him to prove Jonas' guilt, including the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the casino's representatives in exchange for promises to allow the operation.
This Monday, the legal guardian of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecino to ask for a pardon for the brother mayor of the region, on the basis of which he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damages had been repaired and which of the associates had decided to grant a pardon.
By virtue of the official document 197/2011, Jonas Larrazabal is granted a legal pardon, and no complaint can be filed in the case against him, nor can he be asked for compensation or punishment.
After a hearing with the legal representative at about 15:50 the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yanez, went to the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case had been put on the books.
He also informed him that the judge had ordered his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) has informed that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed the Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter hit the ground with full force without the pilot having the chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, stated that before the takeoff, the pilot stated that the weather conditions were favorable.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit has made several contact with the ground, "the wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, therefore it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
He also stated that, based on the investigation conducted in the area of the crash, no parts were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that the aircraft parts were not found in any other location, so the plane struck the ground as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed to carry 19 people, meeting all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary assured that at this time the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general director of airports and support services, said that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was traveling at the speed of a normal flight and the accident occurred on a gentle upland terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident, it was a routine overflight operation", he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome identified six basic points of the investigation:
The visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must be able to see the terrain during the flight.
The weather conditions:
The AICM report indicates adequate conditions at takeoff, according to which the aircraft is proceeding towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico, cloud layers were visible at low altitude.
Routes selected:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew searched for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the helicopter's last radar readings match, so it's likely that there was no loss of control or alteration of flight trajectory prior to impact.
Dispersion of aircraft debris within the restricted area:
The information we have at present allows us to assume that the impact was on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The scattered debris diagram indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of the impact.
No fire or explosion reported.
No evidence of an explosion or fire was recorded at the scene.
The latest test results indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the fieldwork, the wreckage of the plane was found at an altitude of 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain is sloping, the slope ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of what appears to be a disintegration along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have made contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search of the area surrounding the accident, in an area larger than the designated area, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the assumption that the accident occurred while the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Health Insurance Institute launches research on the gene that causes obesity
The Health Insurance Institute is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for child and adolescent obesity.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to identify the gene that causes obesity in children and adolescents.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the National Center for 21st Century Specialist Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research is open to the general public, with or without a licence, and can be accessed at the participating IMSS sports centres in the Valle de México, where tests will be carried out on young people every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and that since October 8 this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (Eastern Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are collected, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and to trace the risk factors in Mexican children and young people, and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He said that every Saturday, all participants are anthropometrically measured (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (to try to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health-care worker concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and a 47% increase in obesity in girls", said an IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the Earth is different from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and five percent African genetic makeup, a fact reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was that they would receive an overall assessment of the children's condition, which would reveal whether they were overweight or obese.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential, and doctors give it to parents in writing, explaining all the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that involves a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using public transportation instead of walking short distances.
Obesity is also caused by a high caloric intake, i.e. a higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, breads, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content, and genetic load, which is the subject of this study.
There will be no gaps in the asphalt of UNAM.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, is creating modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture with improved functionality, independent of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving were done properly, almost 200,000 potholes in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area would not need to be repaired after each rainy season, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, the potholes would be significantly reduced or even eliminated.
In his lecture "The Technological Cause of Dirt", given during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that a laboratory under his direction was developing modified asphalt with polymers, which would produce a mixture of asphalt and asphalt-like properties but with greater mechanical strength, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve functionality and reduce the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltene, and low molecular weight molecules called malten, which together give asphalt its typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to crack, he added.
This means that the strength of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform but varies during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, noted a chemical engineering expert.
A chemistry faculty scientist observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with a flexible tile made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is the asphalt layer, made up of small stones that are poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He pointed out that each stone that makes up the cartridge is covered with asphalt.
This allows the forces in the tile to be distributed well when cars pass or pressure is created.
If it were modified asphalt, they would have decomposed even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt cartridge is to be covered with a final layer, called a mantle, made of fine stone, that is, sand, also covered in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle's rims, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and ensure road friction.
Since the coat will be subjected to a heavy load as part of the grooming, it must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken to ensure that the material is not too heavy.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to bear in mind.
Once the ground is wet, the water spreads inward and is hard to get out, causing all layers of the pavement to soften and form a pothole.
He explained that the first damage to the asphalt matrix occurs after the film has been destroyed during the formation of the voids, but that this damage does not occur in one moment, but is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of debris, and therefore the thickness of each layer of paving must correspond to the load of the vehicles and must be guaranteed not to exceed this load.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, much work is still ahead and research is still in its early stages.
What did the candidate from Valle need to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to be crowned Miss Colombia.
Valle is the 14th first runner-up.
Valle del Cauca once again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winner's podium, earning a silver crown and a sherpa, making her the new first multiple Miss Colombia.
The department was awarded the 14th first multiple title in the competition, based on the results of the final in Cartagena, where she won the title of Miss Atlántico. Melina joined the ranks of the Valle del Cauca women who were on the verge of winning the crown, but were eventually declared first multiple.
A question many ask themselves.
The result is the defeat of the big favourite, who in all the previous rounds has shown that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing she became the Royal Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the Miss Colombia title.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury chose to name her only First Plus Miss was the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary editor Leamos.
To the question, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very strongly in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me as a child was The Little Prince, a very profound book.
I'm currently reading Crime and Punishment, which is a piece of world literature that we should all know, and I have with me today a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer was disliked, first, because of the term 'culturing' and, second, because the candidate did not explain how the books in question affected her.
After the ceremony, Melina expressed her peace and joy at the outcome: "The world is wise, what is to be, will be.
And you people, read it if you can, The Little Prince is a wonderful book".
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who won all the previous awards (Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for the best artist's dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on the stage.
It was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was a bright light on both sides, it was clear she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN's "Home Like Home", believes that Melinda's winning the first multiple title confirms that the contestant who wins the most titles in the competition does not end up with the crown of the queen.
Plus, Valle's been holding a rather unfriendly stance towards the media in recent days, and it hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Pageant.
Just to add, two days before the vote, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"The beauty of the Miss Colombia competition is not enough, you have to see something more than just physical beauty, you have to focus on social feeling, it's important that the candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
There is also speculation that candidate Valle lost points because of her back-story and fibrosis, which was visible on her butt, but this is in complete contradiction to the verdict of the jury that elected her as Miss "Natural Beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the buttocks, which in my opinion were not too noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine thinks that the Valle native made a mistake by undergoing several surgeries.
"Surgery is fine, but it didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong point, and it took its toll here".
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Assembly of Beauties, after the swimsuit parade, a cruel prediction was made that came true, claiming that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had given to Melina, so that he would not have to give her the highest crown.
Whether or not this is true, what is certain is that Melina has begun her reign year today, not as a queen, but as a princess, with a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, to which she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her resounding success at Cartagena, failed to reach the crown.
Such was the work of the resident of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cana
A fingerprint expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's supreme leader, "Alfonse Cana", through fingerprint matching.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week it was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the Chocó City Hall, where he often had to walk for more than five days through the forest to reach the location of the bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints, a science that deals with the study of rubbing the skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Can, the Eliazar family was told to bring clothes for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He left Palmira for Cauca on a helicopter Friday night.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the body, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance, which was completely different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, no glasses, much thinner.
But the prints are not lying.
With a Galton magnifying glass, an ink and a transplant machine, and a light, Eliazar began to compare the daktyloscopic records of the corpse with the entries on the card.
The eye did not disappoint: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was tasked with confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the FARC's Supreme Commander.
Finding the Trace
For the dactyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Canva" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without room for error, that can play a key role in criminal justice.
In addition to identifying bodies, these people help investigate crimes like robbery or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of the injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house because that's where the thief leaned to get a safe full of jewels and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take prints, but in this case we were able to take a fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator, who was involved in several thefts", he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicion in a murder case.
A man was found dead with liquor bottles around his neck.
Investigations revealed that a family member could be responsible for the murder, and the fingerprint on the bottle did confirm that.
Although it's not 100% certain that he was the killer, it's clear that he showed up at the crime scene.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the items are "cleaned with chemical or physical reagents".
When they do, a grafting machine or a tape is used to remove them.
Then the prints are sent to ASIF, which is the database of delinquents, or to the Registratura.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data is not recorded anywhere", said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it is on CSI.
Just like everything that glitters isn't gold, not everything you touch leaves a trace.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
The "outrage" is protesting in New York
Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they were planning to camp.
A large number of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday as they sought a court order to reenter Manhattan Square, from which they were removed earlier this morning, and then attempted to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they were hoping to get through a court order allowing "indignant" people to return to their homes.
"If the court doesn't allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the "outraged" response to the eviction ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg went all the way to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the protesters to continue to live there.
In addition to the "outrage", they took another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and a parish lot at Trinity Church.
They managed to occupy the site for at least an hour, but then police arrived and detained some of the protesters.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious leaders have also come to express support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed, pending a court hearing, which is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation is analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to the officers guarding the square, causing "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or using "laws that were published after the shutdown began, or from prohibiting protesters from entering the mall park or other places they used to use".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that in light of this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the public space and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's highest official personally defended the morning's evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and was initiated because the protesters "broke the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square evacuated because it was becoming "a place where people didn't protest, but broke the law and in some cases hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about their quality of life".
"The early morning eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people", added a spokesman for the movement, which accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of speech".
Occupy Wall Street also said they plan to hold "big actions" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be portraying the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a swimmer on "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of veteran musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 as the Virgin Mary.
CTV today aired footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for her Internet home pornography, appeared with her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe motorcycle racer, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll of Jesus in her crib.
As Joseph, Peters will appear on stage, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
Besides Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called Kim Kardashian "a fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Revives After a Devastating Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of decline that began in March.
Japan's economy has been paralyzed since March last year, but it is now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September reached a position where it was possible to turn the page with definite effect: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the second quarter results - for Japan the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the January to March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machinery necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending down by 0.9% compared to January to March, the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to get us out of it, or to rebuild the infrastructure, to use the shortage to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly because of the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokens have been handed over to the internal market as the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the 'rescue assets' for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying prospects of the US.
The stronger the currency, the more expensive the products abroad, which is a negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their poor results in July to the fact that they had just taken the course in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by the EU's peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen", said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, yesterday.
And the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economies of the major powers are slowing down.
It's down four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even dropped below the average, which is at 100 points, and it has risen to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty
Papademos says that austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With fast and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty re-emerging, Greece is increasingly entangled in the maze leading to an exit from Europe's major debt crisis.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek government is more a result of Brussels' demands than the real convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day term given to him by his appointment will probably be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections to be called on the supposed date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit", Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarasa's message leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the transitional government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing more".
The Conservative chairman went a little too far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, who are supposed to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he said he would not support or sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already furious at the impact of Papandreou's referendum gambits, stressed yesterday that its demands are unassailable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of 8 billion.
The Greek queen has a little more to do.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has 'achieved a significant position at the global level in microfinance'.
Queen Sofie yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor to the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, whose essence is that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
The Queen opened the 5th World Microfinance Summit in Valladolid yesterday, saying that there was "no doubt" that this type of operation was "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve the reduction in half of the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the amount that sets the poverty line".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", for whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have achieved much" and "many challenges still lie ahead".
The Microloans Summit is not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to support the 'core objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the aim is to have 175 million poor families accessing these financial services by the end of 2015 and to have 100 million families lifted above the poverty line below which they currently live.
The concept of micro-lending spread to Spain and other countries after "the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, set out on this journey", the queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and a necessary recognition".
She described Otti of the tool as "an admirable idealist who embarked on a path of fighting poverty". She first became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to see his loan policy on the ground.
The experience has been followed by others, such as the first World Summit in Washington and others, such as the one in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, and the one in Canada in 2006. 'In all these meetings, I have seen a continuous development,' explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for the project, earned the title of 'head of the family' awarded to her yesterday by the 'movement of the poor' in the Valley.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and find solutions to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohoby, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-lending is "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not let solidarity itself become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, which celebrates a concept based on giving people the trust that everyone else is closing the doors to.The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was without serious problems for Chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not on the agenda originally, but became one in the autumn, mainly to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps towards the Italians tomorrow to be lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission put forward by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of ovation at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and then a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: "no less Europe, but more Europe" as a response to the crisis.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor, "the time for change has come" in Europe.
This could be expressed in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission under universal suffrage 'to give Europe a single face'.
This is, in any event, one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree to this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is marked.
Likewise, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to rank each country's weight on the European Central Bank's board according to its economy weight, which would obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
In her efforts to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to win the Congress by talking about "small" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the European proposal devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Lipsk.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is disability fraud?
After the support, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against the disabled.
On Tuesday 15 December, Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the social assistance office in Bordeaux, where he will make a speech on the theme of combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity, a recurring theme since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on the incapacity for work.
First, to save money, the government intends to impose a fourth day of disability on private sector employees before they start taking sick pay.
To put it bluntly, without the company's consent, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic impact: giving state employees one day of unpaid incapacity for work (which they still have no incapacity for work as opposed to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under debate, the right-wing majority also raises the issue of fraud, this time focusing on the evils of work-related disabilities.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return", Xavier Bertrand warned in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in the face of the truth about the inadequacies of the incapacity for work.
In fact, they have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressure that has paid off.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily allowances, with their 11.3 billion euros, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity benefits and occupational accidents and 54% for incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So just 2.5% of the health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, French people had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that hides some deviations: another survey published in 2007 by the job-seeking website Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time by the sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of incapacities were for less than 8 days, 22% for 8 to 14 days, 15% for 15 days to 1 month, 15% for 1 to 3 months and 11% for longer.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to disability than elsewhere.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for medical reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11.8% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on work disability is a very small fraction of the black market.
As for the frauds, these are only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on incapacity for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that, out of 1,5 million checks, 13,8% of the 285,000 carried out were 'unauthorised or too long' due to short-term incapacities, i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million checks were 'unsuitable or unauthorised', i.e. 132 000.
This means that a total of 169 000 'unwarranted' cases per million of employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents a lot less than the number that represents black labor.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing from the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words to parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government of unity would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan", the prime minister said in his first public speech on Wednesday, as he opened a vote of confidence in parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October Eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos expected the country's public deficit to be "around 9%" of gross domestic product by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures", Samaras stressed at a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
We agreed on the goals of reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste, but we are against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of €8 billion without written guarantees from all parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are being denied the right to die.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including for cancer.
Canadian society lives by the idea of death denial.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make a decision accordingly.
That is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option is deemed necessary in a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
To start, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, an independent agency, that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medication or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, say experts with a mandate from the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire to die at home, which is the majority of Canadians, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This is the average for all of Canada, while the province of Quebec has the highest number, with 86% of people dying in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is caused by any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are incompetent or non-compliant.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in teleconference more than a dozen cases of this kind of overreaching in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that according to a 2010 survey by the Angus Reid Forum, 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will help alleviate the suffering of those at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who commit assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear-cut when it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest that the criminal law should state in its list of recommendations that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally established refusal is not a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requires that medical professionals be trained in the duty to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer.
Finally, on the issue of palliative or final mutilation, already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts' reservations
Some experts in medical law have already expressed their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of the experts signing the report as 'extreme' in that it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide", says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the individual above all other values which constitute the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a 'manifesto for euthanasia'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the report's data on the absence of wrongdoing in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated outside the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russian support, is resisting it and talking about a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership of the Arab League was suspended, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring country, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "hand over power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts of Turkey to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who cannot live in peace with their people and satisfy them in the Middle East will leave", he said, referring to neighboring Syria, which is facing an increasingly hard line from Turkey.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's disloyal behavior" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking a more and more harsh tone" toward the Syrian crackdown, noted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Toner.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 16 civilians and 19 pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during the same period.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated heavy machine gun fire in the town of Jobar" in the Homs area.
But at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "made its way out of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus as a member, which he described as a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow down", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favours the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he says is behaving "paranoidly".
A new special League meeting is being called tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the resolution plan agreed on December 2 that included, in particular, the withdrawal of the army from the cities beset by riots and the release of the imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League decision "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to accept a plan to resolve the crisis, but completely avoided supporting any sanctions against Damascus.

Monti demands time and sacrifice from the Italians
The next Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to assemble his team and start implementing a programme of 'sacrifices' to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner held talks with political parties yesterday before meeting trade union and employers' representatives today.
He would have to form a relatively thin cabinet of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the prime minister-designate.
The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask the parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
Mario Monti will end the consultation by presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
He stressed that "democracy is a matter of timing" in terms of the government's preparation and its programme, adding that he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns re-emerged after the unexpected collapse of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should make the team mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include 'politics' in it.
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, the date of the next elections.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of the parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti, on taking office, promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy 'a strong link' of Europe once again.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that 'even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy remains unchanged'.
The European Union is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of a balanced budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, and calls for further tough measures.
Confindustria boss Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that is not growing cannot keep up with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, the former European Commissioner (1994-2004) renowned for his expertise and independence, the 'Professor', who, according to the authors of the introductions, symbolises 'a call to seriousness' and 'another Italy', represents for Italy a 'change of era' after 17 years of 'berlusconism'.
The great unknown will be the lifespan of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, as Italy must place 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization that specializes in nuclear risk reported Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is relying on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its'serious concern' at the'possible military dimension' of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, which draws extensively from documents of the IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was supposed to have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was supposed to have been engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in the Ukrainian capital in the early 1990s.
He was subsequently involved in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls 'clear indications that the development of the detonation system by Iran' was 'based on the work of a foreign specialist who was not only well-versed in the method but who, as one Member State has informed the Agency, had worked for a substantial part of his career on this technology within the framework of the military nuclear programme of his country of origin'.
Anti-Muslim crimes and misdemeanors increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or barely increased during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase versus a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in anti-Jewish offences, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is troubling to see these criminal acts and offences on the rise again", Human Rights First stressed, "the rise of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organisation added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these abuses", he adds, and estimates that this could be done by improving police reporting of "hate crimes".
"Hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing to become more like Facebook
The microblogging service Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to track followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook service.
The new 'Activity' and 'Name' features allow you to better and more directly know the activity of other people who follow you or whose tweets you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to follow posts, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have favorites, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before being rolled out to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des grands réseaux publics Facebook et Google+.
In their tweets, netizens immediately give different assessments of the importance of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, takes up too much space and is too much like Facebook", @jemb123 writes.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter", posted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inscription of the golden rule of balanced budgets in the Constitution
Austria's ruling Grand Coalition government of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats decided on Tuesday to write the "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating by the AAA rating agencies.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, in a situation where Austria's public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one single grade from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", argued the chancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the Eurozone Summit in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts be enshrined in the Constitution or an equivalent law by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the 'German model', Germany being the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
The public structural deficit will have to decrease by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year until 2017 and, from 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.

Emergency threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to hit the foreign exchange markets again if he were to continue to tighten.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we find too much instability" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Y. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it returned to the historical highs that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo traded yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just broken a record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then has it steadily risen, buoyed by the purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in the uncertain times of the world economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar dropped again to 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro dropped below the symbolic 105 yen bar near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is damaging to island exports by raising the price of Made in Japan products and reducing the value of the profits that Japanese companies receive from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Noda, who fears that the rise in the yen may not kill the fragile recovery in its infancy.
The world's third largest economy recovered in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and household consumption burdened by the disaster.
But the prime minister felt that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which began a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all measures to weaken the yen.
But the BoJ's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, noted that the BoJ had previously taken "patching measures" indicating that no further monetary weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the securities issuing institute increased its purchases of treasury notes by ¥5,000 billion (€47 billion) and raised the ceiling on the amount it devotes to purchases of various securities to flood it with liquidity to ¥55,000 billion (€519 billion).
The euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock market is falling.
The risk of a debt crisis plague is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointments of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
European stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are falling into a negative expectation today, Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris at 10am, the CAC 40 index is down 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions over the yields of distressed eurozone countries, equity markets around the world continue to yield only a fraction of recent gains".
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% decline, which was caused by market participants' fears about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsušige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 with a 0.4% decline.
Brokers said the currency had retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday that would allow countries in trouble to leave the euro zone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, Tuesday, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to heighten the concerns of market participants.
The future Italian government's head, Mario Monti, was pressing the markets for time to rectify the situation in Italy, threatened by the poisoning of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is once again in the market's line as the country holds elections for the Chamber of Deputies on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish ten-year bonds has reached a new all-time high.
Expecting the euro area growth numbers
The statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly driven by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards the second quarter's figures to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that economists are most concerned about.
For its part, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such investments and the place that nuclear energy occupies.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are now 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic trends will cause electricity demands to double between now and 2050 unless we want to deprive a significant portion of the world's population of vital life components.
At the same time, we will have to face the shortage of fossil fuels to continue generating electricity, and we cannot forget the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that is currently missing from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case with Belgium, which is subordinating its decision to the need to find another source capable of replacing itself, or with Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name just a few, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding a power plant that had been suspended after the Three Mile Island power plant accident.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity, the increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
All of these adverse effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves our consideration.
The European champion in wind power, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, which causes CO2 emissions and the prices of Danish electricity to be 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the unchanged nature of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay 40% more in electricity bills than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the survival of industry on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as well as not opposing this energy in principle, as opinion polls show.
It should be remembered that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to create a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 secondary jobs.
The highly export-oriented sector attracts a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises to international markets, creating jobs which cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to abandon the nuclear power plant, it would sacrifice a significant number of these SMEs and lose the 6 billion euros per year the country earns from exporting nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to last 60 years while the manufacturer is scheduled to decay?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, let alone any diabolical one.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have the National Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power stations as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is respected, have a notion of safety in their blood.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal traffic conditions and left no human casualties and no environmental consequences.
The Chernobyl tragedy was caused by the design of the reactor and by inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the previous two.
The EPR reactor is a design that can withstand such phenomena, the result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers.
While all the interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to AREVA's and EDF's competitors and a way to give them a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machinery control the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overcrowding of the police, the courts and the administration subject to the politics of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the land of human rights" that France boasts.
Recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students became a matter of concern when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération, 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it has rarely been analyzed from the standpoint of economics.
I have to say that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone in 1976 when he said that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of Polish plumbers on French soil was shared on both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we are willing to extend to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande limits himself to platitudes when he says that joint development will solve our 'migration problem'.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is valid maybe in elections, but it's very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published work summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p. 352), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration is holding back growth and hurting employment.
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those with lower qualifications, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more than substitutes for French workers, performing jobs in sectors where there is a shortage of workers.
There are few skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not enough to fill the job market.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementary differences between French and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements will cause a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And it ignores the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution to the public budget (income minus expenditure) of €150,000 over his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed the wish to go for the missing growth rate "with a precious tooth".
The teeth mentioned to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, what remains to be done is to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it has experienced the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag in the 20th century, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people may believe that for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it will be enough to make the choice and make it as honest as possible.
But it's been known since Napoleon that it was about ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once put it, a 'machine of oppression'.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, and from the very beginning, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The admission of the error of the Greek referendum of the yes-no type will have the double effect of revealing the need for a great return to political power, but also revealing the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought through to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can achieve nothing by calling for a series of national referendums, organized by necessity and disorganized.
To be exposed to Europe's absolutist monarch or to plunge with bound feet into the hollow of nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want the knives of the guillotine, but a joint, full-fledged, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't even know where to stop counting - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its own incompetence and its own lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the European project to democratic sovereignty.
Only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the domination of the markets and invest for the future.
The solution to the crisis will require decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we will be in for disaster.
After long struggles against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now insisting on a European economic government.
Be there.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must embark on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To create a republic in France, you had to "be" a republican.
A revolution of interest was not enough.
This lesson remains.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe that is more politically democratic and a true European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
Contactless chip cards are spreading
In an atmosphere of optimism, the world's fair for the chip card will open Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in worldwide sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most prominent segment is contactless technology, which allows payment in mass transport or purchases to be processed simply by bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million cards with chips are expected to be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million sold the year before!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and to reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being dragged by APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big chain stores work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
To incorporate a higher rate, banks must now provide it to their clients.
"Two major French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa France Europe.
Banks test mobile payments
But that's just the first step toward the payment device of the future: the mobile phone.
Only a small number of devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for transaction processing.
"They were not late".
"But their true flourishing should come in the next year".
"We estimate that between 80 and 120 million of these will be sold worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced the launch of a trial in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 clients and associates will have their iPhones equipped with a contactless payment enabled case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also, yesterday, Société Générale announced that it was preparing to introduce a mobile-phone contactless payment option for its clients.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing suspicions that there are links between the Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) terrorist group and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria was now "certain" of this.
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them", he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the connecting bridges.
After the abduction of AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day, along with several of their captors, in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble of the attack, French and Nigerian investigators found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The axis of terrorism
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers in particular are of interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who had spent time in Maiduguri, the northern city of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQIM and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must wait for more convincing evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this 'support' has become increasingly apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational practices, which now include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A Quick Success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sin" in the Hausa language, endorses the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its followers wage a war against the central government.
These people are focusing on churches, bars, and government offices first.
In 2009, Boko Haram followers became extraordinarily active and increased their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is the same as always.
The army surrounds the city, and 800 are dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
From that point on, the group radicalized and abandoned its northern base.
On Christmas Eve 2010, he carries out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it's back to Abuja, where Boko Haram attacked police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security specialists.
Now, with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb surrounding Mali and Iger and the Somali Al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
In an interview with Goodluck Jonathan, President of Nigeria last week, Alain Juppé said that France was on alert and ready to "pass on all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues concerning China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are all over the place in their oversimplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Voters might think that when they hear about the presidential candidates.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making loud statements and briefing on the foreign policy issue, which has traditionally been a Republican stronghold.
Often, unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or helping Israel are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the top contender in the race for the Republican nomination, threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulating their currency", a hot topic in America as parts of its industry have migrated to Asia.
Worse, if this must involve the launching of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with any sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost hesitated in his stance, which "humanizes" the emotion.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (currently President Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the poll, remains unheard of.
To the painting of President Reagan
Romney also promised to launch military strikes against Iran if sanctions failed to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran", he declared in a fanfare.
"If Obama is reelected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-best-placed candidate, demonstrates a shameful lack of knowledge of the documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against the Chinese military threat as Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently unaware of the fact that China has had a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants a hit on Iran, says he's ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, which was outlawed by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and fellow candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is a far cry from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, his hasty boys' out of Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya and thus attribute to him the label of a weak
But the attack is not easy.
The public is looking more positively at President Obama's national security policy, which removed bin Laden.
Iraq has no confidence in military intervention that leads to confusion.
And by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking at the door.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas into Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which links Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has started operating.
They have to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the occasion properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the controls around on the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
This new pipeline will start to deliver an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year via the first 1 224 km pipeline linking the St Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, due to be completed by the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And it's already being mentioned that there's a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction project is a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being piped across the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As these two countries lose some power, it becomes more difficult for them to pressure Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
Warsaw expressed this most forcefully when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the 1939 occupation of Poland.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it comes at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia barely managed to get its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-hungry Western states, whose deposits are coming to an end, through five years ago.
'This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,' said François Fillon at the opening ceremony, demonstrating the political and economic importance of the big gas contracts.
This explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a major engineering feat.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from the anchors of naval vessels.
It rests on the sea floor at an average depth of 200 m.
The construction was to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"For safety reasons, almost 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed", says Jens Müller, a Nord Stream spokesman.
Measures to protect the flora and fauna also had to be stepped up.
The pipeline itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel Towers, uninterrupted by any valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it, as the Swedes were only slightly keen to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up on their shores.
"In the event of a malfunction, we can stop the gas leak in less than 1 minute", says Jens Müller.
If the gas is not sealed, the gas in the pipeline will leak into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the builders, because the welding was designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The outside of the pipeline is controlled by a submarine robot pulled by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This 1 metre diameter cigar shaped device is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pressed with gas.
The target after three full days of travel at 3 m/s will provide accurate information on any deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leader with a 51% stake.
It was joined by E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and Gasunie in the Netherlands and GDF Suez in France (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely favourable.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacity to this company for five years under a renewable contract.
'Gazprom will have a profit on the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,' explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs thus amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be recovered, as Gazprom alone bears the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves are 15 feet high and form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature, and other characteristics of incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
As of last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - the brand log
Founded 50 years ago, the Italian firm Moleskine wants to bring back the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine is easily recognized by its black rectangular plates and its white-colored leaves that seem aged by time.
After all, the Moleskine Notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design, but a distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company at the time, misses the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique of 'moleskin' (imitation of leather), which is used for example to finish the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought back to life an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Sales rose by 26% between 2006 and 2010 to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote, hidden production from the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to construct an artificial image of the buyer, since the notebook will be as interesting to businessmen as to students or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
A small Italian company that started with 12 employees has grown to almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain of stores to small boutiques in the city centers, where he has been able to assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, despite the stormy development of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature has accompanied the development of the Moleskine notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition 'Zacházka', where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, she also introduced new notebook plates resembling leopards at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine is capitalizing on its success and this cultural aura and diversifying its products: bags, pens, pencils, laptop cases... The brand is expanding to a whole range of media.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed handicapped workers?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today marks the 15th anniversary of the handicapped employment week.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is still twice the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is that depressing?
"No", stresses Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organises Employment Week for the Disabled.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher".
"However, much remains to be done".
It should be noted that for unemployed disabled people, many obstacles remain before they enter the workforce.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a diploma and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10 000 are handicapped.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make re-entry particularly difficult and are the 'core of the problem', according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was set up in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that managers surveyed had 'a poor level of knowledge about disabled people' with 'an exaggerated view of people in wheelchairs and of mental or mental disabilities'.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set by the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, give a rate of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, the director general of Agefiph, an organisation charged with collecting fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of 'penalised' enterprises, as well as by the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million) between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law that increased contributions has put a lot of pressure on businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, especially in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
"What a luck"
Before the Blues challenge on Tuesday night, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens made no secret of the pleasure this friendly match will bring them.
We won't go so far as to say that there was an alliance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made a brief and successful reconciliation.
Five months after his attacker's furious gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I'm very pleased with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward", assures the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and those of the national team, "it's one and the same, he justifies it".
"I'm in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium".
"I need to clear my name".
Hazard, who was spared against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, is coming to the Stade Saint-Denis to finally shine.
And the word "joy" is not to be overlooked.
To play against the Blues, whom he's coached since he was seven, and in their winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This inevitably adds to the 'special' nature of this meeting.
More so, because "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) in front of me", he says.
"We crossed paths immediately".
"To be able to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens has also kindly mentioned "pride".
"Pride" to fight "fight - feast".
'Pride' also noted the quality of the 'neighbours' that France, just over a year after the trauma in the South African town of Knysna, 'has once again become a very high-level team'.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job", he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 to... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great", he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll realize that for the next few games". Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism against Bosnia this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubts that the Portuguese national football team, which he has been at the helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
We have one game left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
With the score 0-0 in the Bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing is in the bag.
Portugal had certainly more than an hour of lead, but they were unable to score a rare goal to relieve him.
"It's a good result, which, however, involves a risk, because we didn't score on the outside".
But at home in their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident they will advance to a crowd that should create a boiling cauldron, even though the match certainly looks "very even", says the optimistic but keen-minded Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The match in Bosnia on Friday is decided by a goal for Portugal.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's not without risks, because we didn't score on the outside", Bento lamented.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with great individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the very beginning, so as not to give them time to think.
A good idea, provided it proves realistic this time.
