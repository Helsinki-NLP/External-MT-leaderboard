European food inflation slipped
The accelerating inflation rate in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The November price increase was higher than expected in 13 euro area countries, with annual inflation of 3.1% following the October 2.6%, reported the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the European Union.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the basic rate, unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, saying that a reduction would lead to an inflation spiral, coupled with rising raw material prices and easing unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below 2%, but close to that.
One analyst said the ECB is in the twenty-second trap: "We need to talk down" inflation so that we don't have to act on it later.
In Germany, the November inflation rate of 3.3 percent was a 12-year record; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has been driven by rising food and energy prices.
The yields of grain increased by 88 percent, and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Food and milk products were also subject to substantial increases in 2007.
The global market price of crude oil has increased 52 percent this year, and last month, it cost nearly $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5% this year in 2008 but will decline to 1.9 in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% over the next three to four months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
However, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis.
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support circle has grown significantly since early December, and it now has the largest support circle since 2002, while Gallup has never measured such low support for socialism, at 13%.
For the party-listed candidates, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two thirds (71%) of the support for the MSZP versus one fifth (20%).
The MDF and the SZDSZ are under the parliamentary threshold, with support of 2% of the total population.
Among the party voters, there are one percent more supporters of both camps.
The economic climate could deteriorate further than it had before - never before, 41 percent of those who expressed a strong view of the country's economic situation were very bad, while another 46 percent said it was rather bad.
Families are again becoming more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the more promising prospects of spring and summer.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In a Gallup poll in December, 71 percent of respondents thought the prime minister was doing more badly than the prime minister was doing well.
In Gyurcsány France, 13 percent of respondents trust or are very confident, while in Viktor Orbán, the support rate is 38 percent.
54 percent do not trust the head of government at all, 27 percent do not trust the chairman of Fidesz.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of society thinks that without a change of government, dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed.
While 35% of the population considered the government and the prime minister to be desirable after the unrest in October last year, the proportion is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) see only the solution in the run-up to new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of respondents to a question about their intention to participate say they would definitely go and another 20% say they would probably go.
By comparison, only 55 percent would be certain of a "parliamentary election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent would say that the outcome of the referendum would be unquestionable given the current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent to visitation fees, and 84 percent to hospital daycare.
If we look at the same percentages among those who are only guaranteed to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of voters would oppose the introduction of tuition fees, visas and hospital daytime payments.
The most expensive is Auchan, raised by Tesco with almost a fifth
In the commercial triangle of Budapest, hypermarkets have maintained an average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that this year the price has not increased.
The Daily Economy article
This year, the average Christmas basket of the Day in the Bouddha Triangle grew by 16 percent, but in all supermarkets the value increased by well over a thousand forints.
Since prices in grocery stores had already "declined" in December last year, the percentage of prices that had risen from the previous high base was not drastically higher.
But it is obviously frightening to consumers that what they were able to get for just under $9,000 last year is not being available for even $10,000.
The Daily basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the 10,000-forint mental limit by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forins.
(in 2003 the cost of the basket was forining 6800 forints.)
The price of unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the price of turkey camel, nuts and mackerel also rose sharply.
KSH was tracking the price of flour and bread in stores, although we found a kilogram of bread at Auchan for 139 forins.
The competition did not bring the price of the product below HUF 200.
Also surprising in this store was the fact that the price of the two-liter recoverable bottle of Coca-Cola was under FIR 200, so they only charged FIR 257 for the product, including the deposit fee.
But this year, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest in the Daily Basket.
Our calculations show that Cora 15 increased prices from last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices from about 18 to 18 percent in the Daily Basket.
The difference between last year's cheapest and last year's cheapest basket was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's cheapest and last year's most expensive was 21 percent.
The average increase in Forint was 1,480 in 2014.
Last year the average price increase was for a total of forty six forints, so that the effect of the price increase in oats was felt at last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and the stores were apparently unable to decide on the price to be applied to each product, as they were unable to calculate the effect of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader designs the speed of a product incorrectly, a significant profit can be made at a price adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
The price of the Daily basket was so high last year because of the oak that the most expensive basket was worth more than HUF 1720 compared to 2006 and the cheapest basket was worth only HUF 844.
This year, this extreme did not show up, as the most expensive one today was forty-three thousand dollars more than last year, and the cheapest one was forty-four thousand dollars more.
The two Christmas seasons have seen catastrophic price increases, with daily consumer items in hypermarkets rising in price by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily support the KSH data: the Office of Statistics has measured a price increase of more than 30% over 12 months for some basic foods.
(For example, alongside flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price index of the already rather expensive product last year produced a price increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base price in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg producers, and they have managed to beat the drastic price increase in the multicolored market.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hyper are not complaining, they're constantly reporting good years.
In our experience, the majority of shoppers in the three stores surveyed no longer care about prices.
They buy quantities from everything, they take the sustainable food in plates.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores were lined up in front of the cash registers as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
But we know that rural traffic is slower, and there are many complaints from research companies that even their plans are missing revenue, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being used to save money
This year, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the density of beds, the overload of staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
They just diagnosed MRSA infection in the trauma department at St. John's Hospital.
A man who was involved in a serious accident was shown to have antibiotic resistant bacteria.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred earlier this year.
A seriously injured man in a car accident was released from the hospital, but soon afterward he had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery was not performed since because of a bacterium in his system.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Center, Böröcz Karolina.
That means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens are probably registered in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) are well-responsive to antibiotics and well curable.
However, when antibiotics are used in excess or improperly, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops a highly antibiotic resistant bacterium that spreads rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, temporary or permanent immune system malfunction can cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis - in weakened, elderly or low-weight patients.
According to the medical director of St. John's Hospital, MRSA infections are not unusual, and they are a common practice in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not there, Nyulasi Tibor said, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate such patients, nurse staff treat them with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics to treat them", said Nyulasi Tibor.
Patients admitted to hospital are tested for MRSA in their bodies, but this does not always prevent infection.
Not a fashion sample
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to prevent the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients entering and patients carrying MRSA should be isolated immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most cases are then exposed when a patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief medical officer of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and national guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always follow this.
Microbiological samples are even less common in the communicable and basic care, Böröcz Karolina said.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another through medical personnel.
So there's a very big role to play in handwashing, gloves, wearing a mask, but there are also significant gaps in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by drop infection, contact, but in home hospital conditions, isolation of the infected patient is not always possible.
In fact, hospitals were often crowded, often with beds very close together, even though patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also true, Böröcz Karolina noted, that in hospitals in poor financial conditions, disinfectants are being saved, there are few nurses, many patients, and so the chances of infections are even higher.
Böröcz Karolina said that where appropriate precautions are taken, there may be fewer such infections or the spread of the pathogen could be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is costing health insurers enormous amounts of money, and they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included the prevention and reduction of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful and, based on the data reported, there is a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has priorities in preventing the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII District Police Captain has been prepared.
It is unlikely that the retired District XXII police captain, who was driving drunk or drunk, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, informed Morvai Attila, the spokesman for the Metropolitan Attorney General's Office, on Friday after the expert opinion on the matter was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the preliminary findings of the investigation which already established that the former police officer did not drink alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII District Command, in his personal vehicle, struck a 55-year-old man who was approaching him on Tuesday while he was cornering Kossuth Lajos Street in XXII District, not trying to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing.
(The latter, therefore, is not a mitigating circumstance under the CRES rules, as the pedestrian does not cross the zebra, and the cornering driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
The district police chief resigned his position and asked to be placed on probation, police said, because the incident shocked him so much.
The Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
Morvai Attila also acknowledged that the former police chief had cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements totalling EUR 400 million for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed with Finance Minister Veres János and Vice-President Marta Gajecka of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EDB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which the parties have already signed a loan agreement of €100 million, the newly signed contract is for the use of the remaining €200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also provides budgetary funding for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining EUR 150 million likely to be used later by extending the loan agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million innovation contract, which is mainly used by the budget for the University of Debrecen's research and development project.
The meeting also discussed subway 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU, they would return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to János Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The EIB shall provide interest on loans with an EURIBOR-linked 8-year maturity and no maintenance fee.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular - the attention of all Europe is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's still cheapest but fastest-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular destination for real estate in Eastern Europe is now, without a doubt, Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beachfront houses.
Among the mountains, the most famous are the regions of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and along the coast are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshine Party", the ancient Zozopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the area of Kavarna and Balczyk.
Analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria believe that sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and that more and more people will also buy in the region of the affordable Rusz.
The capital, Sofia, is also attractive for its commercial and office space, which promises the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf destinations in Europe, making it a prime destination for the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying big, for example in the Bansko area.
Analysts say that in Bulgaria, real estate buyers are also striving to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Malta and Cyprus have also been involved, and the Black Sea and ski resorts have traditionally had a large number of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be grouped into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between €50,000 and €100,000, or buy old houses that have been destroyed for €55,000 to €15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication, important to them being in a big city, with shops and, in general, with a local doctor.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria was ranked in the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term value gains.
The price of capital properties continues to rise as demand increases.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, it has grown by 21% per annum over the past five years.
The rise in property prices is essentially greater than the rise in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian 6 percent
Minister for Environment and Water, Fodor Gábor, informed that the expert meetings will conclude on Tuesday and that the post-2012 international climate negotiations will resume on Wednesday following the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out efforts following the emission reduction period set out in the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently the subject of intense debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that it does not wish to negotiate exact figures at the moment, although it is willing to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The second big question of the conference is whether developed countries will commit to reducing emissions and providing both material and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
The agreement also included aid to developing countries.
The aid fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member Board of Directors, expected to be within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), read in Market and Profit.
6% of Hungary
Minister for Environment and Water, Fodor Gábor, supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role as a flagship in global climate action efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU commits to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the 'Post-2012 Agreement', and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other major developed regions and developing countries of the world are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Fodor Gábor pointed out that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol countries had set a target of reducing the total by 5.2%, including the EU - then 15 other Member States - minus 8%.
Hungary's commitment to a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet, recalls the press release from the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, where the long-term international climate agreement must be capped within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be delayed beyond 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the reduction commitments under the new international emission reduction system, as highlighted in the latest report by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change.
This would delay reducing emissions and make an increase in Earth's average temperature above 2°C inevitable, with extremely serious and irreversible consequences, scientists say.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
The video sharing platform is used by units of the British Army to promote themselves.
The RAF first got the news on YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature, helmet-mounted camera footage are checked by Air Force Operations Command in Cananda and sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the locals.
The political message is inevitable
139 such videos of Air Force soldiers have been posted online, and more than 75,000 people have viewed their "channel".
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan operations, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Mission in Afghanistan
The Air Force's original intent was to record the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense says it's also good for informing the general public about the true purpose of the military's presence overseas.
Propaganda in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads, said defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but it certainly carries some political messages, as it specifically demonstrates the legitimacy of government-sponsored military action.
The Americans were playing a game.
The military is also concerned that amateur videos, along with carefully edited, censored footage, show the deaths of soldiers, for example, in a slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda film, officers talk about the losses to the maximum, but do not show the bloody side of the battle.
By the way, there have been many videos on the Iraqi and Afghan battlefields that have been leaked online, which were made during the intense operations, but the British military only recently got them.
The Americans are recruiting a bit differently with a free-to-download shooter game called America's Army, where the player can hide directly into the skin of the soldiers in a more or less life-long simulation.
There's a Christmas of destruction and slaughter at the ministries.
Labour Minister Lamperth Monica doesn't seem to be feeling emotionally: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-long working meeting for her colleagues, who have been thanking her for her coffee and cooking since 2007.
There's a ministry where live music parties are held, and a place where the Christmas spirit is enchanted by the sound of a whistle and a car whistle.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how I enjoy power.
The government offices are getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest ministerial Christmas party in the world is being held by the Department of Defense this year, but HM isn't expecting department employees.
Children of fallen soldiers are given gifts at Orphan Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited at Mission Christmas, and a press conference is also organized.
The wallet is set to spend 25 million on the year-end mood.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) are firing him from the pack compared to the rest of the packages.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future, for a total of forints 4,320,000, and about 350 guests from the six hundred employees of the Ministry will be expected.
At the purse ceremony, they'll stick to the Christmas spirit, but there'll be performers and lottery.
The NFU Christmas cost forint 4,700,000 and was held in the National Council for Justice (OIT) building on Wednesdays, with concerts and dinners.
The rent for the room cost one million forints, and the remainder was spent on more than four hundred guests.
We know that one of the NFU's departments is also involved in another Christmas celebration, organised by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU funds.
The purpose of the theater was to rent out the building.
The information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt, as we were unable to reach the person.
No need for a suit
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFU but also by the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which organised a Luca Day party on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money to use OIT's products.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's greeting and after dinner, live music was danced.
The question was asked: "The evening dress or costume was not required at all".
Puritan's throwing a party for health, labor and municipal wallets.
The Ministry of Health is organising a show and a ceremony in its own building for 400,000 forints for the workers.
But Labour Minister Monica Lamperth is officially not at a Christmas party, but at a workplace meeting this year.
The press service said that the party will be attended by 180 guests, who will only be given coffee and pasta, so they will bring out the party for 350,000 forints.
But then, the Bajnai municipal minister Gordon will simply be sitting in the lobby of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Regional Development with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
For every guest, they're offering 2,500 forints for the Christmas party - a Swedish table bet and a car bet.
Ever since John Veres became the minister, every year the PM staff celebrates Christmas like this.
But there will be no party atmosphere, and the officiality will be confirmed not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon appointment.
The Agricultural portfolio will be bidding for the New Year on January 20th, the Ministry's Christmas is delayed.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyad Castle, the City Hall, and according to the wallet, the 100 guests will receive 1000 forints per person.
This will be a very simple standing invitation, which is only valid for foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary.
These annual weddings begin with a brief ministerial greeting and end with a restrained curtain.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold a Christmas party at all, the relevant press departments told [origo].
The price of the Environmental Protection Agency's Christmas gift was not disclosed in the press room.
More than 400 people were invited to attend the party at the Museum of Industrial Art.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the National Federation of Trade Unions and the League of Labour Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate the strike on Monday.
A general assembly of protesters is being held on Saturday, and the strike will begin on Monday, the day of the closing vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will certainly cause a major upheaval in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and the BKV will also be on strike for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will present details of its Monday strike, organised jointly with the National Federation of Labour Councils.
The strike committee for the LIGA-MOSZ will be established to coordinate Monday's actions.
A general assembly of protesters will be held on Saturday and, starting Monday, organisations joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date on which the strike began was not set - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the National Assembly does not approve the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
If the bill is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide to continue.
The Parliamentary agenda on Monday also suggests that the health insurance bill will be voted on only in the late evening, possibly even at night.
The strike, which begins on Monday, will lead to significant traffic jams: the railway will be shut down indefinitely, and some public transport in Budapest, including more than half of the Volan companies, could be shut down in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a halfway blockade in many parts of the country.
The call for strikes was joined by numerous trade unions and civil society organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organisations have declared indefinite strikes, others have announced temporary strike action.
By Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railroad Workers (VDSZSZ) had not yet reached a satisfactory agreement on the services, as Christmas holidays approach.
According to reports, the strike will last from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m. at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, four hours of strike action by the LIGA Electricity and Power Industry Trade Unions, and two to eight hours of strike action by the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times nationwide, and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) of the SZEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The League's four main demands are that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and release a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is that a new pension calculation method be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, to ensure that the pensioners with age-appropriate pensions can enter the scheme in the appropriate occupations before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (FTU) belonging to the League of Trade Unions (LTU) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for railway wings, and another offer is awaited.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement, have raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The company's "cocktail warning" stated that the biggest political risk to the Hungarian Guard is that "the ethnic tensions between the Hungarian Gypsy and non-Gypsy population may escalate into violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this can be traced to one of the main failures of Hungarian politicians: "the public debate on Roma has been handed over to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy against Gypsy-Hungarian".
This, they believe, deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the research institute notes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, due to the large domestic and international media attention, "have significantly undermined the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of its stability and its faith in democratic development".
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006, as part of the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has received increasing publicity and momentum, more than one organisation, calling itself a "national self-defense" association, has been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these compilations is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while openly proclaiming their members' - even armed - preparation for defense (disaster protection, homeland security, law enforcement) tasks, and also citing the inadequacy of the police, the military, or the state", they added.
They noted that this was done in accordance with the methodology which seeks to place different political endeavours in civilian dress based on the political and non-partisan nature of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association are therefore not only a means of avoiding legal errors in the court record for these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, several neighbouring states have also cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and some neighbouring countries' ultra-nationalist political actors want to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this will affect the political stability of the region.'
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern and Central Europe, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As they wrote, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The Bulgarian Guard was formed in the wake of the mass Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this and decided to establish the guard, saying that the organisation's aim was 'national self-defense'.
They say that Bulgaria has experienced "gypsy terror" for the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, Political Capital recalls.
It was added that the initiative provoked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they are setting up their own guard as a resistance.
As the Hungarian Guard's operations so far bear similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Romani people in Hungary will respond to the threat by organising their own self-defense, as stated in the risk warning of Political Capital.
Juhász Attila, Director of Research at Political Capital, said that the risk analysis was one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they publish their risk analysis every year and if they experience something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
♪ Not everywhere is a red letter ♪
In Hungary, the law specifies the days in red letters exactly, and the organization of working days around holidays has become a common practice, which will be reduced in the future.
The EU and the US do not celebrate the same holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working holidays.
Holidays are often associated with church holidays, historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the year and the first day of the new year are both off - the latter just to give holidaymakers a break.
We have 11 red letter celebrations all year round, by the way.
It is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 on 15 March and also on 23 October, the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, we celebrate the work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two days of Easter, Easter, and Christmas.
Since our public, national, or even religious holidays are rarely held on weekends, it has become a practice to keep the working day off when we work only one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the cost of extended weekends is that we stay away from work and school on the Saturdays before.
The exact time of the day immediately before or after the holiday has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees employed by them, civil servants and those in a public service relationship.
However, it does not affect service providers and institutions which operate without interruption and which, by reason of their purpose, operate on working days.
This year, the work schedule is only changing around the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost cease, as experience has shown that the days between Christmas and Easter are "swept away" by most people, or used for this purpose their saved time off.
We'll have more holidays next week, midweek and weekend, so we'll have less workday holidays than we did this year.
First, the calendar is reworked around the work holiday, and then the workers stay home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, and Friday, May 2, will be a day off.
The second shift is due to coincide with the October 23 holiday, which will be Saturday, October 18, instead of Friday's 24th.
However, the end of the year may be a perfect celebration for next year, as from December 24 almost everywhere a nonstop holiday is observed, even if it falls on a New Year's Wednesday.
Six scary little things to piss off your colleagues with
Emails that we forget to send, voice mail messages that we never get, innocent lies that we almost never notice: they "color" our workplace everyday.
The question is, do you get used to minor inconveniences, or do you put on the gloves and deliberately avoid misunderstood situations that might cause others to get angry?
I mean, guys.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you I was looking for you in the marketing department", says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
At best, you're sorry and you're trying to make things right, maybe you're calling the marketing department to tell them you forgot to give the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's all about an apology.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, it is worth considering what can cause your colleagues to feel uncomfortable and consciously trying to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than getting a paper, a desk tool, or a phone, and that's nowhere to be found.
Remember yesterday you put your fire engine on the table, but it was up in the morning?
Do you think you'll find a lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be rightly angry at you for taking their property.
Don't put your office envelopes or your mail in your pockets, because it could be uncomfortable if you run out of time and you need it right away.
You're talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not put your concerns about the privacy of your colleagues on everyone's face.
If one of them shares his deepest secrets with you, don't live up to his confidence.
Keep the information hidden and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about your colleague's clothing.
You're calling me sick for no reason?
When you call the office and report a headache because you feel bad or feel like you should rest that day, remember that someone else will have to take over your work, your chores, your scheduled work.
Don't stick it out with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you will not be going to the office the next day or that something may occur that will force you to stay home, tell your colleagues and your boss not to miss you the next day.
Squealing, whining, calling
You're into the job, but you're getting a hard-on from the coworkers' laughs?
You accidentally witnessed a phone call that you never should have heard?
Do not disturb your coworkers by whining, singing, or talking loudly (which you keep on doing over their heads), or by kicking, constantly cursing, or loudly dissatisfying them.
All of these can be confusing, even if you are not getting into one project (writing, design, organizing).
Are you blaming others for your mistakes?
If something is not in time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, blame nothing else for your forgetting.
Don't rely on the chaos in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit your mistake, and if it's caused someone else's disadvantage, and cut the slack.
Ask him how you can make up for your mistake, make up for the loss.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
A jack-o'-lantern and shoes: comfortable for home but not for the office.
Don't wear comfortable lounge clothes if your work permits it.
Don't be slick, your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes - if your work requires it, nicely, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Car-crawling in the usual breakfast jam.
The radio is lit with a special tune: a violin sound that is accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm going to turn the volume up.
The music has changed pace and the bass comes alongside the earlier sound, and then the female choir is turned on as a real jewel.
Zagar's Wings of Love is on Mr. 2.
For a long time, the local music scene has been very unpopular with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the whole thing is different when you listen to the new Zagar album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, some new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and while guitar-driven garage rock is fashionable again, domestic electropop is proving that there is something new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs started out in the kitchen, and he played in Yonderboi himself, until - perhaps because two trumpets didn't make it in a quartet - he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and music that blends elements of jazz, electronic dance, pop, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
French: Sezon.
Their initial small club line-up was recognized by a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 among the top fifty most important country albums, and in Yonderboi, Zagar was named the almost single most marketable country trendsetter in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and the band were "trending", but no one asked them if they wanted to wear the label.
The band reacted well, they made a new, better record.
Their new album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself is intended to create a continuity with the early years of the band.
This was one of the lines of a band called Zságer Balázs.
We'd be in the spotlight with a light, flying reference, but in addition to the airiness of the music, we've seen - in keeping with the spirit of the era, the trend - the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll.
These songs were featured on the album's Millennium premiere by the singer George Ligeti, who is currently with The Puzzle in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, with the latest Mr2 Petőfi playing popular music from dawn to dusk, beginning to sneak into the ears of the six country singers ("Underground Divas") recorded the generous songs of Wings of Love.
So, is everything okay?
The H.G.U. asked the Witch Balázs.
With this new hit, the question now is, how many layers of music do you have left to play?
Zsager Balázs: The definition of a layer doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music casting, not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative underground music can be flat, silent and just as easy to sell, making it commercial.
But you can get a good pop out of a good heart.
Your receptive attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
ZSB: Overseas, especially in the west, there are more traditional songs.
Not only do the 10 to 20 year olds go to concerts there, but the older ones too.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music around them because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
ZSB: It's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never put music on the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more pronounced in concerts where the influence is already working, but it's only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Yet, I have noticed that if you want to answer to the audience, you are no longer interesting.
How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's lead?
He's a solo artist, and he's built his career west of us.
ZSB: We don't really follow his path, no matter how often they try to explain it in our music.
We're more like team players who trust the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be likened to Yonderboi music, as many of us left his band and took a different path.
Wings of Love is number one on Mr2 Petőfi's top list.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time.
You've consciously opened up to a wider range of popular styles?
ZSB: We didn't have a plan to write a slug and then sell the album.
This song is about more.
We were going to the album finale, which was an attempt to solve the sound effects and the more difficult topics on the album.
How did you pick the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the rule?
ZSB: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came up to us to put together this choir from the sound soloists of our own home music scene.
This was the beginning of a six-piece choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - that we later renamed Underground Divas.
Did you design the song exactly like that, or did the girls do it?
ZSB: The number has been around for a long time in instrumental form, and then when the album came together, we thought we needed something else for this number.
The chord was attracted to my accent.
That night I sang the song to her, which the girls later learned.
It was almost first and it was all terribly spontaneous.
I remember he was very bright back then, but of course the Divas needed him.
My voice wouldn't have worked so strongly.
On the album and at the concert, it looked like the girls were in the background.
They have no solo (except for Judy Jay's short vocals), no role of their own, they sing completely together and are no louder than music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were on the backstage.
Is that intentional?
ZSB: The fact that they were standing behind was simply due to technical problems.
But we're aware that we didn't want to share the solo roles.
And the song is about letting go of our egos, where they came from, where they're going, and letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoria that we felt when the song was born.
Who did you work with the most?
ZSB: In the music creation process, there were actually none of them, but rather the mixing of the pieces.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, which I play on a race piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then pretty slowly everything came back to its place, like a game of thrones.
What's your favorite song on the new album?
ZSB: It's always changing with the concert and the fact that I've already "lost" the album.
Now, the Prophet is a Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never the Same.
The traitor broker risked billions for a sense of inferiority
It's a cold scream.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the banker of the French Société Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
It lost almost 5 billion euros because of Kerviel.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not at all talented, was a great player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he was timely to recognize the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He is of limited mental ability", said his superiors who notified the police.
However, as reported by Le Monde, Kerviel's statement shows that he made a profit of €1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
The Crisis Is Not Just in America
"I only wanted to make money for my bank", he said.
In the summer, it was the American crisis that brought him half a billion euros.
You saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income or past-paid customers.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe that and made him a good horse.
The profit at the end of the year was EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to report it", admits Kerviel, adding that he kept nothing.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports so that they wouldn't be revealed.
He managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex exchange was interested in his trades.
Risk was profit
You were afraid it would all come out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them".
How did you get the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked for Société Générale Bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and became a freelance broker in 2005 with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, when I first spoke to her, I knew that they were looking at me with a bad eye.
"It's because of my education, my professional and personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after his entry, his first big success came.
He made a profit on the Allianz stock, which he raised half a billion euros to bring down those stocks in the London bombings.
And that started an avalanche - he wanted more.
While you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a ball of sand", he told the cops.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or rather suspected.
"I was looking for money, and they were blindsided".
But there was a disaster earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he tried to blow me up.
When he started work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him a suspect.
"Last year, I took only four days off.
The broker who has no freedom is the broker who does not want anyone to look at his reports", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a potential to acquire 365 billion
The Czech government ministers and the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic will receive EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion crowns) over the coming years.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures are compatible with the internal market.
The seven operational programmes will cost the regions about 125 billion kroner.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, goes to transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
The funds will increase the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90,8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and firms to acquire tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also be given resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but also to implement more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful countries in obtaining EU funding so far.
Former Nicaraguan president sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the country's former president, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud totaling $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return to the bars is unclear, according to AP News Agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, it will be up to the prison administration to decide whether Alemán's sentence is served at home or he returns to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly referred government funds to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were in reality the relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was subsequently spent on a foundation which Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget is being cut
That's right.
They've approved the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget this government has drafted, approved by a coalition majority, without opposition support.
This year it passed with the support of the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow it to pass.
Unlike the debate about the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, though most influential, law.
That's a contradiction.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggles of the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciated in the press, which is why it gets a lot more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The Social Democratic governments of the past have struggled with three shortcomings in their public budgets which the 2008 budget cannot address at once:
The first is the high proportion of the so-called mandatory spending law, which refers not only to pensions but also to social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent 'coalition' of the ČSSD and KSČM ahead of the elections.
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first shortfall.
The third limit is the deficits in public financing, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and towns.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are deficits in the city and city budget.
Many mayors, who could raise money for other investments besides taxes, taxes, and bank loans, often unwittingly issued bonds that disproportionately borrowed their towns.
In recent years, these debts have been paid off by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely solely on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
For some years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been in a phase of growth with which the Czech Social Democratic Party has been steadily boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for your government to regulate public financing.
Instead, the country was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, far more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a huge embarrassment to previous governments.
We are among the countries that face the least threat of poverty on a global scale.
For example, there is no need for huge social programs, which have unfortunately become enormously large in recent years.
While we managed to eliminate some of the nonsense populist spending that was approved before the election this year, unless we get a retirement cap and pension reform in the near future, there is a real end to any politics in this country and whoever rules it will be just formalization.
It is a bit exaggerated to say that the majority of the taxable money from government politicians is usually used as a mechanical distributor of pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot be revolutionary, it can only stop the suppression of normal expenditure by authorized expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not wasted everything they could in the last decade.
If we don't want to see the government politicians become mere officials, we have to be patient and calm about preparing further reform laws for this not-too-strong coalition government, which knows that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and fees.
Only these will allow a balanced budget to be achieved gradually.
The following is the list of the countries of the European Union:
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
Money markets are thus worth over a hundred billion dollars through the stock market.
On this exchange, the bank raises the interest rate on which it is willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed puts $40 billion on the stock market and makes 24 more available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should address the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks can lend", Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group advisory firm wrote in a report to his clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl added in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in the United States primarily because of unpaid loans.
Analysts expect billions in further losses.
"Central banks can really keep from seeing what else might happen if they decide to do this", said Kieran Davies, chief executive of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensive loans to their customers.
This would reduce the need and push the US economy into recession with potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks subsequently decided that the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank supply rate used to lend money on the interbank market, had not been reduced.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of lending to each other, even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and the UK also lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to further interest rate cuts", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters news agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' actions contribute to the prevention of the crisis, as they do not solve the underlying problem of the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The incredible debate among ecologists
Global climate change is the greatest threat to developing countries.
President Klaus has once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali.
His book, Blue, not Green Planet, presented in Vienna, made clear that the ecologists' arguments are incredible.
Klaus said that not only was the conference's structure unacceptable, which was a mix of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanied it.
"The debate there is completely lacking structure, it is just a flurry of words that are substitutes for solving current problems", Klaus said.
In presenting the book, the Czech President stressed that his theme is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to it.
He expressed satisfaction that the book was available in German, since, as he said, "I often encounter cartoons of my own opinion".
Now, therefore, interested parties can read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient funds to write such a book.
As an academic, he has experience in statistics and economics, and is able to monitor and judge professional papers.
He concluded by stating that climate change is constant, that is, that its changes are normal, and that the global warming is not the view of all scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as an experienced totalitarian, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the audience that 'it is not against rational protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits'.
Klaus was talking about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 were unable to exchange their licenses
600,000 drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for a change so the offices can issue the new license in time for the end of the year.
The Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without a valid driving licence.
The authorities say the license was not primarily issued by those who no longer want to drive.
While the traffic is a sharp decline in interest in the licence exchange, the capital's offices have been flooded with applications for the licence exchange, which has seen increased interest this week.
The Office of the Mayor-General receives about 2000 clients a day.
You'll have to wait in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
A new license is issued for 20 days.
However, a new licence may also be applied for with a shortened period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver must pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete a compulsory licence change before the end of the year and leave with an invalid licence face penalties from January.
The guilty party must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the officer may also arrange the cut by agreement.
The penalty for administrative infractions is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information from the city hall, anyone who doesn't travel can be fined.
He's supposed to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be forgiving and to impose fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
However, Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said that the tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He says a license is a document that people can use to decide whether they want to or not.
This is not a passport that everyone should have.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should drop their license.
Just take it or recommend it to the appropriate post office.
By the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may replace them for a further period of three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
Hanzelka says there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdych's co-defendants.
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers, who are suspected of colluding with David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague Supreme Court ruled in this case by a final decision, reducing the sentences of one of them to two years and the other to two years.
The Prague Organized Crime Subdivision investigators were initially threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
The decision today is no longer subject to appeal, review is only open to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also a suspect in this case, he is awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other cases, he has served more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
In January, the District Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, including 16 appeals before the Supreme Court today.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying that they are speculative.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after an agreement with Berdych, police members among other things provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up for each robbery and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30% of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment covers the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
The main concerns are robberies, often with serious health problems, but also abuse of public office and unauthorized possession of weapons.
Because police found illegal guns, steel-seed bullets, laser controls, or machine guns during the house search.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
The gang of fewer than 20 members has been found guilty by the courts of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Further members of Berdych's entourage testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases not yet brought before the court.
The first trial has so far avoided Tomáš Putá and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, awaiting a final decision on their release for criminal proceedings in the Czech Republic.
Account for the child exchange: 12 million
For the children who were replaced at the maternity ward, the lawyer for the families affected, Igor Veleba, demands a 12 million crown pain fee from the hospital in Třebíč plus court costs.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostal Veleba, basically disagrees with the proposal.
"We reject such a demand because it is too much", Dostal said after today's hearing.
"In order to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the counterproposal.
We'll see if it has any use value.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostal stressed.
He says the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was subject to an expert review which served as the basis for the compensation proceedings, which was developed by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the children's parents suffered varying degrees of mental harm and stress.
The men were better able to handle the stressful situation, even when they were confronted with eye-popping that did not prevent their newborn from switching.
Women are worse off dealing with the trauma of their lives and what's happening right now, he summed up.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the maternity ward in Třebíč on December 9.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The head of the Vysočina walk, Miloš Vystrčil, at the end of October, gave the families 100,000 kroner to repay their expenses, which were caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is run by the walk.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to statutory liability insurance.
In case of error, they must contact the reserve fund and, in exceptional cases, they may ask the founder for help.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to people, amounts calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Poltava lost its kingdom of Valashsko
Bolek Polívka has lost a lawsuit for the title of Kingdom of Valashsko.
According to the judge of the Circuit Court of Ostrava, although he first used the name of the Valachi King, the project was developed by a team of actors, Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with him for many years.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to be closed and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr Harabiš and his team living on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
He says that in Valachi's words, everyone thinks of the actor-comedian.
Harabiš shares this view.
"We've had almost 10 years of work behind us.
Looking for money and making up stocks", he said.
He thinks the reason for the argument is money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was a success and that they could make a profit.
They want to make a living off our work", he added.
A profitable business
The court said the name "King of Wallachi" was first used by Polívka in a television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, this was not in line with the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the Valachi passports.
The original student action turned into a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš subsequently laid the foundation for the creation of the Valashk society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to sign her name and signature on the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting their farm and theater performances.
Who's taking the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself only used the idea that Polívka had made public in the maness.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project", the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the intense work of Harabiš and his team.
The cooperation between the parties to the present conflict continued until 2000, when Harabiš organised the official coronation of Polívka in Vsetin.
Since then, however, disputes have built up between Poltava and Harabiš, leading to the release of "the forever-elected King Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šulaka, on Harabiš' initiative, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka Harabiš and her colleagues filed a legal action against them, which was rejected by the court today.
The battle that Harabiš is planning for the throne and the queen could shed light on the controversy.
This fight should make him the new king.
She hasn't given details or a date yet.
"We don't want to get anything.
This should be something like a Slovak royal rescue.
The king should be elected for a fixed term.
Mr. Polívka can also apply", Harabiš added.
The test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: missing prejudices
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
The performance of the engine is not unusual, and the quality of the change, the driving and the production can often be described as below average.
But the successor, the Peugeot 207, is already on the market.
And the van called SW goes one more degree, so for me, it's all I have to think about.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, for example, I complained about the seat left by the rear seats.
This time, the complaint is over, because the body of the van means that the two-meter-high giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
♪ Swimming in the world ♪
I'll be able to get through the interior quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here if the car looks that elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complain about the short bottom of the seat or the carts?
The lateral drive also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space, you can see the body size growing here.
The van then disappears in the few places of the head mentioned above.
I'm going to put it in the trunk.
So the main part of this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
I have to say that it is very accessible (and thanks to the disposable rear window) and wide.
The empty spaces are equipped with reservoirs, which are ideal compromises.
They're out of the way, they can be torn apart and they can handle even harder objects.
But let's just stay a little bit in the crowd.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor protection scheme.
However, in the Czech Republic, the most sought-after car of this class is not the Skoda Fabia Combi.
Comparing the 207 SW to the next generation of the newest generation of the Zlava Boleslav, Peugeot is significantly behind the 52 litres.
When you're on holiday abroad or in a stroller, this is almost critical.
But if I'm going to highlight the positives, I'm going to have to mention the almost perfectly straight floor after the second row of backrests are bent or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was powered by a four-stroke, four-stroke, four-stroke engine with a capacity of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the 600th should look like driving the family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-consumption and mostly pulling.
Compared to the Škoda model, which often acts as if a truck was stuffed into the exhaust, I'm just happy to see it.
The price is high
The price of the car is not cheap.
But we must remember that we tested a car with a large interior and a very good engine.
The car with the four-stroke foreign engine will go for 329,900 Kč.
The car starts at 410,990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment tested will throw the equipment away with an additional Kč 80,000.
But we also had airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window-cleaning, electric remote control for the rear windows.
So the car will cost 531,900 Kč by train.
That's a lot, but you count Fabia's supplemental equipment, and you get a very similar result.
So there's no choice but to make a decision on the brand side.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into British schools
In the UK, there is an increasing number of children from Eastern Europe in schools, which has raised concerns amongst the local population about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing many obstacles.
British schools have already recorded cases of violence in the conflict between immigrant children and local residents.
The problems of integrating children from Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in Northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Students' quarrels and feuds have already characterized parents' relationships.
The situation escalated to the point that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old student with a railroad rod.
The culprit defends himself by saying that the boy insulted her with racist rants.
Police had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls allegedly had the man beaten with racist remarks and stoned him.
"On our way home, a boy climbed into the bus station and began spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he hit us with apples and circles and then exposed his naked back", the mother of the Slovak students told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the dispute over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the tension between the local population and immigrants is beginning to develop in British schools.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are believed to be looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be done if you choose the right one.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or the sea, calm like a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or fun cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
But there is much more to be found on one island, Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the epitome of American conquest.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and transit point that the Spanish took to America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late '20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (mainly sepsis) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and all that.
Towers were built in Havana, and the wide streets were lined with cars that became cult symbols in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American show business stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can see the wall of Bodeguita in Havana with your handwriting.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you can have your own cocktail.
And cult cars from the 1950s still run in Havana today, because the once-exported cigars and young people have long since rotted in this salty, wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been largely destroyed, there are no more beautiful colonial monuments in the vicinity.
Other places are getting more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Considering that tourism provides the much needed money, its development has been given a green light.
In the last 15 years, not only have new hotels been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the shores of Holguin Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique treat in the world, which is appreciated primarily by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, your candy was transported to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so there are machines that operate there, whose contemporaries are only on display elsewhere in museums.
Where are we headed?
The most famous places are not avoided by most visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the aforementioned Hemingway Estate has a museum, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss visiting this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba on the western side of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the slate.
The rock formations, copper hills and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley and have a fertile soil that covers the steep slopes with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet him in his final form when you visit a tobacco factory in Havana.
Some may find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode of Chile was filmed there.
The following is the list of countries:
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of a small city.
Influenced by later French settlers, Spanish colonial architecture changed little in four centuries.
Trinidad is so remote from the sea between the Escambray Plain and the sea that even in the 1950's, there were no roads connecting the area to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped keep him out of the way.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't demolish it, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, you can visit places of interest in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
And in the evening, it's appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, where you wake up after dark, where the music is quiet until morning.
Other, of a thickness of not more than 10 mm
Located in the eastern part of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful city in the world.
I'm sure that opinion is influenced by the road itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo to the city have to cross high and rugged mountains, and they run through nature almost untouched by human activity.
The language of eastern Cuba has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its pristine nature.
It is the best chocolate made here, the church has a cross of Columbus (actually made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and on the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, some of the most famous of which are the El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro Plain, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint of Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of former slaves, all have much to say.
So, as they say, it's better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, the Americans say.
A small number of troops and a lack of equipment are also affecting the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should have concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghan mission is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, who have units in the south of the country, agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance to the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for greater action this week on NATO troops, Britain is prioritizing reinforcement of the Afghan government and reinforcement of development aid.
"Afghan development is tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the public to start further economic and security development themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
90 percent
The Afghan insurgency is the most active in the last five years, according to U.S. government data.
Violent crime increased by 27% compared to last year and by 60% in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territories.
The United States, however, says the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of their troops.
Specifically, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how to achieve them", said Gates.
The same spirit was expressed today by Jaap de Hoop, Secretary General of NATO.
"I'm not happy about what's in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and the equipment we need, and that's not much", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries participating have also been debating in recent months whether all allies are providing maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the minimum level of violence and combat demands were not as high against them as against us in the south and east of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan diaries have been published: Germans play while our sons fight", the Sun wrote in a photo supplemented with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded and published a photo of a British team fighting a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt to reach one billion in 2009
Every Czech receives 84,000 crowns of state debt.
Total debt reached 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152,8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the last nine months of this year, this has risen by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, from June it decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Treasury today confirmed the government debt data from early October.
Each Czech receives more than 84,000 crowns in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
"At present, it seems that next year's lower deficit will allow us to exceed the one billion crowns limit only in 2009.
The debt will be around 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns next year", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, at iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: "We could move beyond the one trillion mark in 2009.
That depends on the exact date, the next budget that we don't know yet.
If you could prove that the political situation would change, politicians would be willing to save more, and that could take until 2010.
But I don't assume that change", he said.
Increasing Debts
The public debt is the debt of the central government, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by cash notes, government borrowing bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable public debt reached CZK 803,3 billion at the end of September and decreased by CZK 13,7 billion from June.
The average debt to GDP ratio increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt-to-GDP ratio increased by 13% in the first quarter, which is indeed a lot compared to the economic growth.
Interestingly, the increase is primarily generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than I expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 government debt management showed that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152,8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement in the state budget.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion instead of the supposed 91,3 billion crowns this year.
Furthermore, the Czech Consolidation Agency has a maximum planned source of CZK 13.3 billion, a reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, CZK 43 billion for the financing of government borrowing bonds and a repayment of CZK 1,8 billion from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher is appearing in court today for a name given to a teddy bear.
A court in Cardiff sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and deportation on Thursday night for violating Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old students to call a baby Muhammad, but Islam forbids her to portray her prophet in any way.
Such an act shall be punishable by a flogging.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday, charged with violating Islam and rebellion under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after her parents filed multiple complaints against her with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class's plumage.
"The children suggested eight names in all, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohamed", says Robert Boulos, the school's principal.
Eventually, 20 of the 23 children voted for the name "Muhammad".
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it's also a very common nickname in Sudan.
The children then shared a diary with a picture of the cat and the inscription "My name is Mohamed".
The problem is that any depiction of the prophet is an affront to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school, said that she knew him well, and that the teacher would never do anything that would offend any religious beliefs. She said it was all about "an undeniable mistake", "I'm just sorry she voted for the name with the kids".
Many of her students agree with her, saying that she "treats the children very well" and "never talks about religion in class".
Remember, Mohammed is also the second most popular name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is one way to show respect for the prophet. (The firstborn of the family is often given this name.)
But what rules apply to the use of a first name?
Can a game be called that?
It's obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at the last Vienna hearing on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final meeting between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended without any progress in the positions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status", EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
The US Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "on the line", and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"Violence is not necessary in the near future, but a very difficult period is coming", he added, stressing the "obvious presence of tensions".
The broadcast ends on December 10th.
On Monday, a troika of the European Union, the United States and Russia will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian province may be cleared after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and last since the UN entrusted the troika with a new broadcast in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be complete by December 10.
The Russians, who have already failed to secure Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations after the deadline.
"Russia has been and will remain committed to the negotiated solution, alongside the compromise", said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under UN control, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that she was prepared to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement", said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of the Kosovo Independent Province, at the hotel in Baden, where "the last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the province's future prime minister, also expressed his condolences.
However, he added that his idea of autonomy for Belgrade would be "a continuation of a past tormented by murder and deportation".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable region due to the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise", Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again called for a decision to be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where a Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", said the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians is based on a "compromise" with the Western powers.
Bush urges a deal between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to immediately begin negotiations to resolve the 60-year-long dispute between their people.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, pledged to support them in every possible way so that they could sign the "selling agreement" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must account for "terrorist networks" and Israel must stop its colonizing activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the "peace plan" adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, aimed "to sign a peace treaty that addresses all pending issues, including the central issues".
The latter address three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict living in the territory of the modern state of Israel.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, refugee affairs, borders, colonies, water and security".
Olmert, who will then step down, promised that the future negotiations would be "direct and ongoing" and that he would strive to "finish them in 2008".
Bush announced in late 2008 that the Palestinian and Israeli "two-state vision" would be realized.
Saudi Arabia said it received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which Washington has credited its Annapolis participation as a success) with the support of all Arab countries has initiated a plan to guarantee peace to Israel by withdrawing in return from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is a key point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues", the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, official positions and rumours contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the initial data of the investigation launched by the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel a few minutes after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The car was patrolled, so it wasn't in action. It was moving at 40 to 50 km/h without any siren calls", a police source told us.
The two-helmeted young man was driving at "high speed" on a green Kawasaki engine "not registered and therefore not for use on the road".
"Because the right-hand rule was not followed, the engine hit the left side of the police car", says one officer.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows the severity of the impact, the front of the car is stuck, the windshield is shattered and the thrust is torn.
In an emergency statement yesterday morning, Pontoise State Prosecutor Marie-Thérèse de Givry said she had entrusted IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Safety Authority with the investigation, which was launched for "reckless homicide and lack of assistance".
During a press conference this afternoon, the prosecutor said that at the current stage of IGPN's investigation, the police's responsibility can be excluded.
The prosecutor said three witnesses to the accident, who were interviewed on Sunday night, "confirmed the police report that the explosion came relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, a strip, undoubtedly pulled by the footmen from the road, showed that the two vehicles were crammed together and were traveling together for a while until the police car could not lie down.
The vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers had left the scene quickly without providing any assistance to the two young men.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but excludes any "serious error" by the police.
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution", a police source told us.
Libération met with a witness who reported the incident a few minutes later.
One of the windows in your apartment looks exactly at the scene.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, and I immediately went down to try to resuscitate them", relates the witness.
"There was nothing we could do".
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and upset.
The other two tried to resuscitate one young man, and the fourth called".
Tensions grew among those present as the hopeless condition of the two young men became apparent, and the arriving police officers drove their colleagues from the scene.
Also, the witness's statement says that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They used a heartbeat, but to no avail.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the young people.
The young ones did get help.
Firefighters arrived on the scene immediately.
They did everything to save them", the prosecutor said.
Women in tension in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police stopped the first protests after General Musarraf imposed a state of emergency two days earlier.
Witnesses said that in Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting the emergency measures were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement.
They responded by throwing stones at the police, many of whom were wounded.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar incidents have taken place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
They've produced more people.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers registered for the Supreme Court called for a general strike and protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were also protests in Multan in the central part of the country and in Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the law-enforcement movement has been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal coalition, which represents religious parties, and its leader "has urged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who have taken the oath of allegiance to Musarraf".
"The promise of the Musaraf is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced Saturday night.
The Court will have to declare in the coming days the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the military to fill the role of civilian president "has lost its meaning" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf was required to wear his military uniform until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also dismissed the nationwide rumor that President Musarraf was appointed deputy general for forced residence.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) and improperly or not planned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancies (36%) are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined), 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which liberalizes contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) and improperly or not planned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as the pill or the cervical spindle, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, the institute notes that the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970 only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 took birth control pills, but today that percentage is 60%.
Today, eight out of ten pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth month, she plans with precision, and if possible, for spring, the most favorable time of year for adopting a child.
Significant improvements at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of the damaged solar panel, which was essential for the scientific activities of the station.
This dangerous spacecraft was a record in many respects: it took a very long time to repair, very little time to design, and it had to be done with tools "branded" by astronauts, far from the manned modules.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts were separated from the Discoverie module, the Harmony, a giant spiral-shaped element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see enclosed section).
This module is a kind of gateway to the lab modules.
However, their electricity supply must be taken care of.
The second task of the crew was to transfer one of the electricity generating modules already on the ISS to its final location using 17,5 tonnes of solar panels.
The crew then began opening the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
One of the harmonically collapsible boards was then broken by a compressed cable about a meter long.
The board was not opened to prevent further injury.
The astronauts' original task was to take a check-up walk on the Discovery spacecraft and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotating system, instead devoting their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the exhibition hanging from a 30-meter robot arm attached to the station's mast.
He's one of the best astronauts at NASA.
He's tall, strong, extremely skilled, muscular in body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old man with a medical degree had to "operate" on the "wounded" solar panel.
After carefully measuring the damage, he cut the faulty cable and painted the damaged area with some "paintings".
He was assisted in his work by another "spy" who stayed close to the safe passage and by other astronauts inside, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey robot, was equipped with a solar panel insulation against hundreds of volts of voltage, and the spacecraft on the station were devised and "broken" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his teammates to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today they returned to the Discovery spacecraft seven days ago to begin their planned return trip on Wednesday.
The Commission shall take into account the following information:
The price of EADS shares on the Paris stock exchange fell sharply after the aircraft and defence equipment manufacturer announced that the extension of development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2 to 1,4 billion.
The current price of EADS shares after a 4% decrease is EUR 21,96.
The company was forced to revise its projections for the 2007 operating result as development of the A400M engine is delayed, which obviously delays the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the fighter jet, announced in October, 'will cost between EUR 1,2 billion and EUR 1,4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion will be for Airbus' - said the European parent company of EADS.
In view of the emergence of these expenditure, EADS will have to report new plan figures for its 2007 operating results next Thursday when it reports its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any further figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay in preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS's operating result decreased by 86%, largely due to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380, which also placed a significant financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo remains
Sunday's election does not promise much surprise: a large majority of Russians will vote for Putin's party, United Russia.
In this, the Russians' need for stability, for arbitrary rule, is manifested after a vigorously manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is speaking to voters via public service channels in a television message that has already been recorded but the content is still classified.
Putin is leading the candidate list of the pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, which is expected to win the election in a landslide.
At yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors, the behavior of the head of state revealed nothing: he was just another run-in against Western interference, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations of the law", he added.
However, the opposition believes that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe they have put pressure on the voters.
Communist Party leader Gennagy Zyuganov claims that "this kind of dirty election was not even in Russia in Yeltsin's time".
After the cancellation of last weekend's protests, former world chess champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized protest, and his lawyer said he could not be visited.
"The Russians still think of themselves as 'homo sovieticus'
The predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
Who's following Putin in the chair?
The date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be held on 2 March 2008, was published yesterday in the Official Journal and candidates can announce their intention to run until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term of office cannot be extended further.
Your other successor is not in sight.
What role does Putin play since March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or parliamentary majority, decide the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will win both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition.
"The Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel they can control their destiny", says Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, the historian of St. Petersburg University, goes further: according to his theory, the country became Christian 500 years later than Europe, and civil society is also slow to develop.
"Putin has returned to the paternalistic model that was perfectly suited to the people, especially since this new form of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation but by certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman, a fellow of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "selfishly reject personal responsibility", as quickly emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think about it?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: Local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are elected from the heads of the 85 Russian regions.
And the freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public is more interested in stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Teacher Tamara Tserednyatsenko, 54, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
The most depressing memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive has been made public, documenting the fate of the 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archival documents, which cover 27 kilometres of shelf space in Bad Arolsen, Hessen, have so far been searchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, providing unique and nominal insight for the victims or their descendants.
Eleven archival governments - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the treaty, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives allows historians to conduct research "on the relocation of prisoners, the health of camp residents and forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
To date, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of the documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have suspected homosexuality or a mental disability.
After the war, the Gestapo began collecting the lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants for practical purposes, to search for deported or sentenced civilians for forced labor and, possibly, to provide evidence of their internment, which could be used to pay compensation.
Bad Arolsen currently has more than 300 permanent staff working on tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of great importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India to sign a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching €60 billion in annual turnover.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008", said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India's largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth most important trading partner according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could have economic stimulus for both sides" and "it would increase India's presence in a thriving market of 450 million people".
The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange "EUR 47 billion worth of products" and "EUR 10 billion worth of services" each year, said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation to New Delhi, this week. However, she regretted that bilateral trade "has still not reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday as part of the eighth diplomatic summit attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Answer to your concerns: Bank of England offers the money market £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England, which wants to alleviate uncertainty over credit conditions, announced on Thursday that it would pump 10 billion pounds into the money market, making it available at a base rate of 5.75% and unusually for a five-week period.
"We wish to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also wish that banks can plan their liquidity positions more securely for this period, so that a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered to the international financial market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December", the bank said in a press release.
The bank said 10 billion pounds ($14 billion) would be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 a.m. local time.
This is the first time the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
The Bank of England added in a press release that it was "ready to take further measures" to adjust interbank loans to central bank interest rates.
The current interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has exceeded the level of 18 September and currently stands at 6,6%.
Since the beginning of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has charged a significant penalty interest on money market pumping which has deterred banks from using it.
According to the rumor (which is only reinforced by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro) many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have accessed at a more favourable rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday withdrew from discussing the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the Socialists' meeting contained some 10 measures adopted by the Socialist Party National Office on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment surplus, a restoration of variable fuel emissions, the introduction of travel checks and a reduction in rents.
With the UMP and NC voting against the review of the articles at 180:115 the government and opposition's discussions, sometimes in a sharp exchange of words, were eventually interrupted, just hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would re-submit all proposals as part of the amendment to the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumors about the new Philadelphia music festival being held by C3 Presents, but now the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that it will be hosting the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"It's an honor to work with someone who is the pioneer of the American festival movement today", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 is also hosting the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is being held this summer, so we'll have a way to camp.
The festival will be held from August 8 to 10 at a private 500-month site about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his range by hosting the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been an associate owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which has a capacity of 177,500 people.
C3's Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, adding that his company and Melvin Benn's are working together to make the region a more European-style festival venue.
"The Philadelphia location has been selected before, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to host this festival in downtown Philadelphia", said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to negotiate with the city and the Commission was very enthusiastic about our plan.
Unfortunately, the city's political maneuvers led to the failure of the organization", continued Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we're preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents was revived in 2005 at Lollapalooza's Grant Park in Chicago, after having already demonstrated exceptional festival organizing talent with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events was $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on rural festivals, while our festivals usually take place in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine the two models and create a European rural atmosphere and an American urban lifestyle".
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic about the event", says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not give details of the agreement, he claims that 'the conditions are favourable enough to allow an investment in such an event at a venue that hopefully will be home to the festival for a long time'.
Charlie Jones said the festival will be "tremendous" in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the 80,000-seat Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received an invitation to the event, but as of the press release, nothing is final.
"Vineland will be basically a rock festival, but we're planning a diverse music offering so that everyone can find their own thing", says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, co-founded C3, which received the "Best Independent Event Organizer" award at the most recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you have to fight the Terminator...
Temptation is part of the mission of the Montreal Mission.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the production of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to take on the fight with the "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful, because the film industry decides which is the best location for them.
If you find Montreal's conditions favourable, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions for our decision", says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for the festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now focused primarily on promoting Canadian films.
The Oscars have begun.
The goal is to showcase and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it's the Sundance Film Festival, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco.
The film "The Age of Darkness" was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's going to be shown at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is scheduled to premiere in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also represented itself with four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year?
With just five weeks left before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the usual year-end hair.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, 'statistically, the stock market is generally positive in December.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily accurate and the current situation is characterised by uncertainty in the market, at least in the short term.'
The experts strongly support the end-of-year bullishness of the stock market, although they state that 'the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity for investment, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed yields, which are negatively affected by long- and short-term levers towards quality securities'.
They therefore believe that the stock market will be characterised by a more side-oriented and volatile movement, 'especially as the effects of the Fed's interest rate cut are unknown, as crude oil prices are high and inflationary tensions are also threatened'.
Javier Barrio, the BPI sales manager in Spain, agrees with this, which means that he thinks it would be risky to announce a rally.
The expert said "it's not a rose at all".
Ibex's loss is nearly 4 percent compared to its highest on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet, not all experts are so overlooking.
According to Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the restructuring of its wallets and the regular retirement fund payments.
However, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the rally is moved to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers that volatility is unlikely to affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to the technical level and 'we are therefore experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may increase depending on the news from the USDA, in view of the consequences of the credit market crisis'.
The analyst is confident that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on which securities will be targeted to achieve the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, of Intermoney, stresses that "it's time for the big securities".
The expert would list the two major banks and some construction companies, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally could be a positive one for construction companies, too, if it's going to happen.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for months and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow this path", says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be a major player for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies can also do well, although they are not very representative in this area on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have only been two December price increases.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets were leaping out of the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 percent, it recorded a 6.68 percent jump in December.
So it remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (Ibex currently has an 8.36% increase since January) and whether the final rally will take place.
Banco Popular Español opens an account open 12 hours a day from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts are operated under the Popular Max name and are making a big difference to the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since it is the first group whose branches are open until 8:30 p.m. on a regular basis and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced plans to extend its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just making a deal with the unions that he'd close 75% of his accounts in exchange for opening them up one afternoon, but not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will be the basis for their decision to join the initiative to promote a more favourable opening of their stores.
That's the goal of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses who shop in these locations.
The Bank intends to operate 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the aforementioned opening period, as it is not a new opening order but a restructuring of the existing one.
To this end, the institution is modernizing its branches in the commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
Thus, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the branches, a more modern, colourful design.
The Commission notes that the restructuring plan does not require a large investment, but rather requires the establishment of more employees, which means that eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The accounts, which also include negotiators designed for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Pleasant experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in three Madrid branches of Banco Popular Español.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The vote was taken at the branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 are operated under the Mundocredit name, specialising in immigrants and also have a very favourable opening schedule, even on Sundays and public holidays.
The BBVA model is not used in the units mentioned in PopularMax, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", says Rivero.
So far, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica and they're going to sell cell phones with outside staff.
Telecinco is doubling the market value of its rival, Antena 3, for the first time
"We did it".
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, a trusted adviser to Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when it was revealed that his rival, Antena 3, had doubled the value of the TV station he ran.
But something overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less", he said.
Still, he emphasized that we were "less successful" in the weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent boost.
This increase puts the annual loss at 15.66%.
The company is 52% owned by Mediaset and 13% by Vocento, thus having a market value of EUR 4,488.88 million according to Bloomberg.
Rivalis, Antena 3 lost 1.52% yesterday and has been down 40.5% since January, reaching 2.193.46 million today.
The other listed communications companies are valued at Sogecable at 3,571 million; Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) at 2,518,53 million and Vocento at 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is comparable between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can do in the same market, what costs and how this is going to pay off in terms of viewership.
Telecinco announced last week that it wants to become the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant with Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the notified fact were to be fulfilled, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3,6%, compared to 965,4 million in the 2006 financial year.
Net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the financial year (reaching 734,4 million) while net sales of television increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
Analysts say that one of the factors driving Telecinco's market momentum is the high pay out that it has maintained up to now: in 2006, 100% of the profits of the company headed by President Alejandro Echevarría were distributed among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate may change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol by its parent company, Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payment of 50%, although we always allocate much more.
I hope our shareholders will be happy with us this year, as we've already been pleased with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol".
Analysts say that the market is currently characterised by a slight downturn.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has not yet established any evidence that the Commission has failed to establish any evidence that the Commission has failed to establish any evidence that the Commission has failed to establish any evidence that the Commission had failed to establish any evidence that the Commission had failed to establish any evidence that the Commission had failed to establish any evidence that the Commission had failed to establish the existence of a reliable evidence of such evidence.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated revenue growth decreased from 10,5% in 2008 to 8,4% and from 5,5% in 2009 to 5,1%.
The same company forecasts that the profits of Antena 3 will decline by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 Opinions
The following is the list of the following:
Ibersecurities: it proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly because of the high profitability of the dividend and its long-term sustainability potential.
2
Caja Madrid: considers Telecinco more favourable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retainment) because of its 'multiple appeal' and business growth.
3
JPMorgan: In both cases, it proposes undercutting due to 'similar risks' (supply market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which took effect on November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary debate - which ended today with a congressional vote to approve the Senate amendments - the government has launched a social dialogue on the legislation underlying the law so that both can be implemented before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by the Members and the Senators in negotiating and agreeing the most favourable investor protection norms and detailed regulation of companies' activities in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, enables the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, extending the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new Directive will enable financial advisory services to be provided to firms, both natural and legal, and will create a new financial service provider company (ESIS) form, namely financial advisory companies (AFI), alongside securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems suitable for carrying out transactions involving funds, including multilateral trading platforms and order-performance internalisation systems in competition with current market players.
The Act also requires investment firms to provide market information on the aspects that determine their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and to keep records of all transactions carried out to facilitate the verification of the CNMV.
The Economic Committee of Congress has introduced a number of amendments, the most important of which is that securitised debt is treated as a "complex" financial instrument because of the high risk posed to the investor.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive has also been used to legally outline the scope of activity of those with business and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree establishing professional functions for economists only came into force in 1977.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent working for another account, not requiring CNMV's authorisation and able to sell products to or acquire customers to several investment firms at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November to 4,1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account in calculating the European Union inflation rate, shows the trend of prices in Spain for November.
The disclosure is consistent with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The same calculation methodology is used for the preliminary indicator as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling methodology differs from the estimation of information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Office of Statistics stressed that the preliminary indicator number is purely informative and may therefore differ from the final data to be published on 14 December.
'The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high.'
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents and Minister of Economy, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4,1% in November was only 'temporary', but also predicted that the price index would be 'relatively high' in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that 'although the indicator is not very favourable', the Spanish inflation rate within the monetary union has remained more or less the same over the past few years.
He added that the month of November "brought fewer surprises" than the previous month when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economy said in relation to the data released today.
With Northern Rock, Virgin wants to raise 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and are currently only £12 billion (€16 billion 800 million) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to take out an emergency loan from the National Bank of England.
At the time, it had a record deposit of over £25 billion, which has been gradually reduced over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank by the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money, and Virgin will need to generate about a quarter of the revenue of British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the £30 billion target.
A group of prominent businessmen, Richard Branson, who have become known in England for their high profile advertising campaigns, plan to spend about £50 million (€70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve their goal.
Northern Rock this week announced the Virgin consortium's bid as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested on suspicion of corruption.
Police arrested the mayor of the town of Totana (Nepart) in the province of Murcia this morning on suspicion of being involved in a corruption scandal in the city that erupted this week.
A city clerk and the town's police chief were arrested outside of the building.
Former city council member José Martínez Andreo took over from the People's Party MP Juan Morales in May, who, according to official sources interviewed by the SER radio station, may have been the head of the corrupt network.
Police are continuing to investigate the city's offices and the City Council, and it is not possible to rule out further arrests.
Juan Morales' lawyer has also been investigated as the prime suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER radio, the lawyer of the People's Party Juan Morales was arrested as he left Morales with corruption documents in his purse.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged reward Morales received in exchange for signing a development agreement with a Galician construction company to redevelop 200 acres of land.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono accepts the PSOE nomination in Toledo and the office of the President of Parliament if they win the election.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and then General Secretary of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's toled list in the next parliamentary elections and fill the office of the President of Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE's Secretary of Organization, José Blanci, at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified his election as a former minister by saying that "we have to count on the best" in politics, and Bono "is among the best".
He also added that the Manchai politician would "probably" be the Socialist Party's nominee for Parliamentary President if the Socialists won the upcoming elections.
Bono would take over from the current parliamentary president Manuel Marin, who announced on 15 November that he would not run for re-election and would abandon his political career to fight climate change in academic circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has been under constant siege to return to the political arena since he stopped active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters were aware of who would be the economic vice-president in the event of a Socialist victory, the party wanted to inform them of who would be the president of Parliament, in a "mark of transparency".
If Bono is to fill the post, he wants Parliament to be "a place of respect and not insult or scream" and to look more like the homes of citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where there is no peaceful dialogue is Parliament, and the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
He praised the current president, Manuel Marin, for his "outstanding work", but did not want to present himself as president, lest his opponents consider him "subordinate".
Climate Campaign
Since the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who favor political or social struggles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he should have a political leader like Chief Zapatero, who believes the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and proclaims that "we must make a new deal with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its Government has contributed to Spain's leading position within the Union in the non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance of the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
In addition, it should also clearly explain to the Spanish authorities what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population should be changed, what individual and social energy savings should be expected, and what economic consequences?
So who do you have to sacrifice and pay to save our planet?
But we have not been given and will not be given an explanation of these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and costly for both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE's gasoline price hike would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
So we need to save the Earth from nothing, just propaganda texts, empty passwords, with no real consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The Earth-bound agreement, as the Prime Minister says, which speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even embellish the election meetings and awakens a sense of tenderness in us.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
The mayor of Totana and the police chief have been arrested for alleged corruption.
Police have arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcai province, José Martínez Andreo, a member of the People's Party, the local police chief, the City Hall secretary and a hospitality contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently with several police officers, many of whom are being investigated by the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for managing premises and housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday in a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were converted into a built-up area to allow the construction of 4,000 apartments for the Galician company Nuaria after they illegally paid compensation to the managers during their previous term.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested but are under investigation, according to the Tottenham Court No. 1.
The first six people arrested were turned over to the court.
Official sources say former mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP for the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the former mayor's current girlfriend, who lives in the provincial capital of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with Pablo José M.G., the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, which is also part of the Nuaria Group and through which the bribes were processed.
The investigation is being carried out by the Police Operational Central Unit's Local Government Crime Task Force, which, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 house searches, mainly at companies related to the arrested, operating in Madrid, Vigoban, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested, the owner of a well-known local craft company, who may have been a mediator in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was upgraded, and the project would have doubled the population of the now 25,000-member settlement.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, which manages real estate transportation, Conycase, which manages the parking lots of the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and Piazza Ferdinándo Católica in Vigobà, Hogartel, which specializes in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which manages the sale, promotion and installation of building materials.
Things that happen
The following is the list of the following:
If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month for a while and see if we can acquire any philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already got one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, anyone can come up with something.

Our Finnish reporter found this commentary in one of Finland's largest newspapers: (Certainly on the front page of the PISA report on world literacy), in the Helsinki Sanomat, referring to a review of Blackburn's book that was published on November 18.
"The philosophical teachings of the Jokela High School tragedy were brought to the public's attention.
The killer, in a student's graduation messages, quoted Plato and Nietzsche.
In the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat, Education Counselor Pekka Elo, who was responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato's teachings critically, adding that Nietzsche's knowledge was not necessarily important in the compulsory elementary philosophy classes in secondary schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that the penal code contains a prohibition on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a record is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of six months to one year.
However, if you steal a record in a store worth less than EUR 400, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 from a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading it online (Article 234 of the Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading it online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lesser penalty for getting into a fight than for copying CDs.
If you take part in a mass competition, you can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Code), while for copying a CD you can be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months to two years
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
E. According to Article 184.2 of the CTB, sexual harassment in the workplace is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author's consent is more severely punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's got a lot of things going on.
Four.
I got an article from my GP about a strange research called "Money Causes Brain Activity, Especially When Others Have Less".
So the employees' feelings on payday depend on how much they're paid.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn, using MRI scans, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
Bernd Weber, the study's author and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the participant was wrong".
The researchers found that when both responded correctly and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but when one of the participants received double the amount, the activity increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to reach such a simple conclusion.
Attorney General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bit of a bitter sigh as those responsible for the Srebrenica bloodbath, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, including General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzsics, remain at large.
Their name is on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary, The Carla List (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to pressure the governments concerned to create a loop around fugitive criminals.
What kind of insurance does it suit me?
The car insurance, which provides security to the car owner, carries a significant expense against various incidents and also depends on several factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type of car to be insured and nature of use.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance policy is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First, we need to know what it's about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company shall assume compensation in the event of a disaster in the amount of the fixed insurance premium.
The insurance premium is essentially the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type of car to be insured, use thereof, etc.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. the higher amount paid by the person who is at higher risk of an accident.
That's why women over 25 or older pay less, because statistics say they're less at risk because they're more cautious.
Similarly, the findings suggest that married people are less likely to cause accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of use of the car is the determining factor.
More frequent use increases the likelihood of an accident.
The Commission considers that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
The owner should therefore carefully consider it in order to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the key factors in choosing to best adapt to your insured needs and to create an acceptable price.
When entering into an insurance contract, under 25s have to take into account a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of their licence.
While it's most ideal to be insured against all risks, there are more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can be covered with full insurance, which will keep them safe from all risks and make the price affordable.
In such a contract, the insured party shall pay part of the damage.
"The amount of the premium paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the premium", says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, an Internet insurance intermediary in Spain.
Another option is extended third party liability insurance where the customer insures himself against damage to others but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you'll be insured against theft, fire damage and car loss.
That's good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, as this will affect the bonus and may reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
The benefits are those granted in relation to the basic rate of the insurance company.
And the penalty that's eliminated from the basic rate is called a "mallus".
"The amount of the bonus and the margin depends on the insurance company and the profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus rate", explains Noguera.
If the age limit of 25 years has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance since the risk of accidents is reduced by years of experience.
Then we recommend you take out a full insurance policy.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in an accident, even when driving", says the director of the European Insurance Company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, when drivers have overcome the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but has no children, it is best to take out full insurance, of course, if his financial circumstances allow.
The insurance companies consider child marriages to be the least risky clients and therefore the premium to be paid is lower in their case.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance on your own (this can be up to EUR 300) or, if you have a higher bonus, from the third year of the vehicle, you can extend the insurance to damage to the other.
"They drive more calmly, but they have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share", says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, we offer full insurance on a part-time basis (about EUR 150), or an extension to liability insurance for a higher bonus.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it provides protection for the owner in the event of accidents but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance.
Celtic are trying to score points in Milan to make the playoffs.
Milan and Celtic are set to match their strength at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to secure the missing points at the Champions League closing ceremony, with the Italians taking the lead and the Scots qualifying.
The Italians have a total of 10 points and have secured promotion in the fifth round with a draw against Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they need another one to keep the six-point Shakhtar, who will be fighting the four-point Benfica, ahead.
Group D's two matches will be played a week before the end of round six, as Milan will play in Japan for the Club World Cup, where they will attempt to advance to the round of 16 in the qualifying round on 13.
This will close Group D earlier than the others, and although the most likely result at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be undefeated, the two teams will be looking to win as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better position in the eighth round.
Gordon Strachan's team will be defeated even if they qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but that cannot be guaranteed, as if the score is level, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next clash (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are looking to reach the eighth round of the re-organised Champions League twice in a row after scoring a goal against the Cockatoos in the 0-0 draw after extra time.
The Shakhtar side would be most pleased with Rossonerik's win, because if they lose to Celtic they will reach the eighth round and stay in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being currently in last place and unlikely to remain in the European Championship, can still secure third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour of Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since their breakup in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced minutes before their gig at GM Place in Vancouver that the band were "in great shape".
About 20,000 people exchanged tickets to attend the concert, which also featured a video about the band's history of huge success in the 1990s.
The band's re-form and tour coincided with the release of a new album in Spain by EMI, which included the biggest hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls have taken the stage in a bracelet given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded auditorium at GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not seen our performance dress yet, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason the band broke up two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also appeared nervous during the press conference held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings about the Spice Girls changed.
I thought, why not? I'm glad I made that decision now", Chisholm said of the band that broke up nine years earlier.
She added that over time, "things have been arranged and we love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
CTV reports that the band arrived in Vancouver via Virgin Airlines.
There was a group of babysitters waiting for them at the airport.
The five of them have seven children in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California, USA, then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They're playing in Madrid on December 23.
Another fear over the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transported through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations have always received a great deal of attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the price of gas to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
One is that the previous debate between the two countries last year led to a decline in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow was over the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas and natural gas monopoly Gazprom's attempt to agree on the level of gas that Ukraine will pay Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to implement a 50% increase in gas production from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement with Ukraine in 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in the negotiations according to one of the most important gas transit countries", Ukraine's economic minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters news agency.
'The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to the ongoing debate on the level of transit costs through Ukraine (and into Western Europe).'
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly depressed prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS 'is obliged to monitor foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS committees should improve the criminal records of workers coming from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was put forward by Chief Accountant Robert Black after a doctor of Scottish nationality was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, the report, through a sample of five health authorities, also highlighted key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow airport, the Auditor-General checked the list of recruited staff outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove into the building's main terminal.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were questioned by the Old Bailey court via video link in October on charges of car bombing attempts on UK soil.
For their overseas staff, NHS Committees shall verify the qualifications and work experience of the staff concerned and the availability of the necessary authorisations to work in the United Kingdom before they start employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency is not authorised to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the Auditor-General proposed, inter alia, that the committees introduce the Guidelines of the Office for the Registration of Crime, which will facilitate the employer's control processes with the various overseas countries.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks in personnel records, they are not regularly carried out", states the report.
Black said that the Scottish NHS is performing its own pre-employment screening procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas staff".
Dr Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unrealistic" to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS staff who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
'The report shows that pre-employment checks currently in place at NHS Scotland are working well and that the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent,' he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, their current number of overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the Auditor General pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly because the committees have problems identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures implemented by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the checks of passports, work permits and professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing guidelines and guidelines for pre-employment checks on NHS overseas staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was delighted to have succeeded in carrying out this task after the attack on Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, would take into account the proposals in the report and ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff, including overseas, reflects the best practical application.
Joy Division is holding the film awards ceremony
A biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, "Control", won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The award was also won by the lead actor, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis's performance, and director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won the award for best actress for her thriller "Details of a Scandal".
The Variety Award for British film in international spotlight was presented by Bond's creator Daniel Craig.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise from the Joy Division mountains to 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The film, which also features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack, cost just £3 million to make.
Dutch photographer Corbyn - who was formerly known for creating U2's "Joshua Tree" album - nevertheless won two awards; Best Director and Best Newcomer.
Another winner of the ceremony put rock music at the center; Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer took home the award for best documentary.
The award for Best Actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the boss of the "Murder Promise" gangster in the London thriller directed by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone, who was famous for his tough-guy roles, was awarded the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose credits include "Scum", "Sexy" and "Sexy Hot", is currently filming "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after his late star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" Harris in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney are a door open to people like me", Winstone added.
"I feel very fortunate to have met Richard Harris many times.
Richard Harris's style is close to mine, he was a great actor of his age, and I have great respect for him".
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a panel of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people have been arrested in connection with a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday announced that 208 militants in terrorist cells were arrested for planning an imminent attack on an oil refinery and a strike on several church members and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaeda has launched a pro-government campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to the television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign national is planning an attack on an oil refinery in the eastern province.
Following the 2006 Al-Qaida attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia has begun building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the Interior Minister's report, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a "missile firing specialist" who illegally crosses the border.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight rounds into the kingdom.
Of those arrested, 22 were plotting to attack church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action by church leaders to curb Saudi fighters entering Iraq who join Al-Qaeda and are fighting against the allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which Saudi hardline Sunnis consider a heresy.
Al-Qaeda fighters see a significant portion of Saudi Arabia's church leaders as being drawn by the authorities into supporting the government's royal family's policies.
The militants of the organization, inspired by the call of Saudi-born Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government, targeted foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made enormous efforts in the last... five months", a Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media group" was also captured in Medina, which was aimed at spreading "takfiri thinking", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violent action against Muslims who are stigmatized as infidels and apostates.
The arrested included 32 individuals accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists have concluded that Venus once provided pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is much more of Earth's dangerous twin brother than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are about the same size and orbit, although Venus is located a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, life on Venus could have been very similar to that on Earth, and it could have even been habitable.
However, due to the extreme greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the planet's slower rotation, Venus has entered a completely different evolutionary path.
Today, the planet's water has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroying it.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft - based on a year of studying the planet - paint a vivid picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, even though the two planets are very similar in structure.
"Our new data has enabled us to develop a scenario of how Venus formed billions of years ago, when it could have had habitable conditions similar to Earth.
"Enhanced uranium" seized by police
One kilogram of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether the material was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Opening gates
Mitt Romney says he's not worthy of running for president to answer questions from a snowman.
Republican candidates in the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and transmitted them to candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, proved as ridiculous as the one of the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the debate the other party aired on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time well reflected the position of the Republican Party in the run-up to next year's election.
It is not known exactly on what basis the CNN production managers who co-funded the debate selected the YouTube videos distributed to the candidates.
The longest debate of the first half hour was on immigration.
This is a Republican hot topic.
CNN asked some uncertain voters to put a number on the list if they felt anything was wrong: The mediator had a strong consensus when the candidates spoke out loud about the question of borders.
The most vivid and longest debate has been between the national leader Rudy Giuliani and Romney, who is running in the crucial primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image that he had of himself, that he was too lax about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The conversation between the two became particularly intense when the questionnaires asked about the support for 'amnesty' (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado - have been able to get deeply involved in the subject.
And while none of them are considered eligible for the nomination, their staying on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started to ring the immigration bell sooner and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is broad consensus among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This issue - like fear of Chinese toxic games and other outside concerns - is helping to obliterate or minimize the divide between libertarians and Christian conservatives within the ranks of Republicans.
But when other subjects came to the fore, the discussion grew very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney were debating whether to consider simulated drowning as torture.
Another person asked whether the candidates believed all the Bible's words.
In this matter, Giuliani, stumbled, finally grasped the view that although he considered his favorite book the Bible, he might not have taken the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the Iowa primary - thanks to a strong Christian conservatism - responded to the expectations by saying that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When Jesus was questioned about whether he would get enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than he was in the election.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's vigorous rise in Iowa coincides with the fundraiser campaign of libertarian Ron Paul and the excitement surrounding him in Wednesday's debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate from among the aspirants representing the more familiar and traditional principles.
In the 1980s and 2000s, there was a candidate who united the party, who proclaimed a victory message of America's greatness in a timely and convincing way, and who found a voice in both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided and the consequences are unpredictable.
Pain at work
Another gap before Gordon Brown; the exit route unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, this doesn't seem too picky.
No one has sold their honour, no politician has been charged with Paris hotel bills, no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had been covertly contributing over £650,000 ($1.3 million) to the governing Labour Party of Great Britain for more than four years under the name of others, and that the party had not reported it, was one of the things that would have been a good thing without the outcast Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the prime minister was running away from the election and when he made a statement that the polls had no effect on the outcome of the decision, he thoughtlessly questioned the intelligence of the British, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, who is making increasingly clever remarks, noted, Brown has gone from a once-fearsome Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of a tightly-knit bank called Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and judgemental shortcomings at the crossroads.
The sick proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to cooperate with the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities exposed an unimaginably large amount of administrative malpractice.
In the House of Lords, three Western generals protested the reduction in the army budget by declaring that the position of the Minister of Defence was a part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams's secret donations; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (formerly chief administrative officer) has resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the road leading to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where control becomes unattainable.
People don't like or trust politicians, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
But once it becomes clear that the prime minister is most likely not fit to make progress and may not stay in office for long, the suspended disbelief is over: the public officials begin to leak, cabinet ministers are going to get information, the press is looking for bad news; the government is starting to defend itself and is unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position, since unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as he wants to deny his connection to Tony Blair, he was still his right hand.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and tax records are related to decisions made during Brown's time as Treasury Secretary.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair-like incidents - such as the lengthy investigation into the relationship between "grace for money" and political party funding - voters can rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The gunshots they're taking aren't as scary as those torches show.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful, can be the creation of the guidelines that Brown's Stalin always promised: reliable, solid, and somewhat hard-hitting government.
A good example is the political donation hype.
The Garboian suspect Abrahams, who likened his donation to charity, said he did not want to make his donation public.
Perhaps so, but it was not his responsibility to make the decision.
The law against the anonymity of big political supporters is clear and clear: the public has a right to know who is knocking on the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who he said knew about Abrahams's move but was unaware of its illegal nature, will likely be sweated up during the interviews; as will Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's foundation chairman, who learned of the confusing donations in October.
But Brown, for now, has no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, not even that the huge sums of money were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half his job.
He quickly condemned the violation of the law by his party, but his firmness was weakened by the fact that he had used a familiar tool; for security reasons, he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case.
In this story, the "lecture to be learned" is not too complicated.
In the event of a breach of law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown has other matters to take care of, such as appointing the chairman of an independent committee that has been working without a leader for six months to discuss administrative rules or advancing an effective reform of political party funding.
This would require hard-working Labour to work with the Tories and break off special financial ties to unions - which would be a tough wall for Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
Polls show the Conservatives are leading with a significant lead right now; Brown has two years to get the voters back behind him; the only way to win is with undeniable integrity and strong competence.
Carded sharks
Is the secondary mortgage market crisis threatening the American credit card market?
When blood enters the water, it's natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis affects other forms of residential loans, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The write-down rate for non-recourse loans and the default rate for late payments over 30 days increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss last month in the U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to credit card holders' financial weakness.
But the panic is still early.
The ratio of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The third quarter default rate of 3,89% by Moody's is one percentage point below the historical average.
The decrease in interest rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The 2005 amendment to the US insolvency rules led to a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency filers, but also to a large loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcies (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, whether or not the terms of the loan are being broken.
The payment rate, which shows the ratio of consumers' monthly repayments, is also solid on the market.
Moreover, the confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup estimates that emissions volume in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are increasing their credit card debt to pay off mortgages.
However, card issuers primarily monitor cash flows rather than asset values, so a fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even be advantageous for creditors.
If the property is worth less than the mortgage value, the incentive to repay the loan for consumers is reduced and, as a result, the repayment of credit card debt is ranked first.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions more quickly and flexibly than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-drying of the equipment.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up to completely reevaluate loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime crisis is less likely in the credit card market, the risk of a gradual decline is much higher.
If falling housing prices and falling credit are pushing America into recession, the industry is certainly facing a tough future.
It's worth watching those predatory creatures.
British bankers pleaded guilty to Enron
On Wednesday, three British bankers were brought to trial for their role in a fraud involving former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud allegedly for collaborating with Fastow in a covert fraud committed in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But in a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group have become known in the UK during a two-year extradition procedure.
The closure of the investigation into Enron's 2001 collapse in the United States is still pending.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers baptized by the NatWest Tribe allegedly traveled to Houston in 2000 to work with Fastow and then-Fastow's right-hand man, Michael Kopper, to prepare for the fraud.
Fastow, responsible for the development of numerous frauds that led to the bankruptcy of Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any stake in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew that the interest was very large.
A company run by Kopper purchased the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
The indictment alleges that Fastow misrepresented Enron's claim that the energy company was buying $20 million in shares in its subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But the reality is that the $20 million has hit the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution claims the bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of involvement in the Enron collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana state federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three English men were each given a $1 million bail to travel to the United States, where they remained during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest US company ever, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks failed to cover up the millions of debt accumulated and profitable but actually loss-making businesses.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of jobs lost, a market value of more than $60 billion, and a decline in the value of pension funds of more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's founder and former CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted of his role in the company's bankruptcy last year.
Skilling is currently serving a sentence of more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Lay were dropped with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
It starts at $54 million with a Rolls-Royce-engined Gulfstream G550, which will do so without interrupting the route between Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank.
But for some wealthy Russians, that amount is a small sum.
"It can carry 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But nobody orders so many sessions because they buy machines for private families or business executives".
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors for the four-day exclusive Millionaire's Market, held in a huge exhibition hall in the capital.
Alongside Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods vendors are renting out a booth at the show, hoping that Russian newly rich people will be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-coated 50-cent refrigerator chains.
Mr. Firer was watching the bright orange Porsche on display at the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not like our products", she said.
"Russia has the largest market for private aircraft after the United States".
It seems the Russian capital is floating in money like Dallas did in its heyday, during the oil boom.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890's when some American millionaires went to Europe, and they were considered wealthy here", said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, Russians have now emerged as the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding a share of the gold rush.
At another Moscow venue, at a conference organised by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH's president, shared their views on how high-value products can be sold in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billionaires with a combined net worth of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires is now at 103,000, with a total of $670 billion of savings, according to a study by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, which analyzes personal well-being developments in the former Soviet Union.
(According to the World Bank, in 2005 the number of people living below the poverty line in Russia was 15.8 percent.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, so we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative at David Morris jewellery store in London.
Nicole first attended the fair with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All the women have been unconditionally cared for, and the men are a real treasure trove".
In the rooms, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, dressed as dinner parties on Sunday night, both described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at cars and trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes, and Porsche", said young Yumatova, who dresses in a custom-designed, emergency-spinning suit as if she's used to this ride.
The workshop is primarily for newly rich, brand-oriented Russian shoppers who, after hours spent on the market, are willing to tour a sprawling, digitally decorated venue where they can simultaneously find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mövenpick ice cream, regular billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund plus cats.
For the average person, the entry fee is 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at the Royal Delft stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated blue replica painted by Rembrandt.
"The Russians are more interested in the obvious".
Indeed, the sellers here said that the wealthy Russians of long ago (by Russian standards, this is 10-15 years) had already switched from the logo of the closing to the insignificant, limited-scale brands that would not be allowed in a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire trustees, and tourists, crammed into the building every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the head of the bed manufacturer King Koil, told us that he sold two gold-plated mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, worth $70,000 each.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate at A1 Moto, a high-end car manufacturer of modern alarms, reported that the company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that delivers customized solutions, sold three refrigeration grids to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon, the grids are like chain ties connected, and they cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters wheels made for a Russian casino owner, which Swarovski said he had inserted with crystals to give the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is $22,000.
"A Russian millionaire who wants a circus wheel or a circus face of his wife will not necessarily use these items", Karapetian said.
"Instead, he'll keep them in a garage guarding 30 or 40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Those who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago are now most likely millionaires, if not in cash, but on paper at least", he said.
"There are more than you think".
Those who are not millionaires could at least make a fortune look like it was in front of the booth of the Russian wealth management firm Alliance Continental.
The company built four British-style phone booths that were piled up with millions of fake dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes at Milliomos Market.
Many of the visitors stopped to gamble with their money, and many took pictures of themselves on their mobile phones, winding up in the money pool, or just pocketing a few million dollars.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", Karryev said.
Suspected of surgical malpractice in a New Jersey death
On the eve of Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the restaurant "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop at Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly after.
Then another one.
"I saw the doctor's car stop", said Mr. Livingston, an inspector at the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"I knew someone had died".
Authorities have learned that the deceased woman, 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, was formerly an assistant to the chief of police for Newark.
An investigation is underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unlicensed operation by a cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by police at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine the cause of Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death that has caused great pain to senior Newark police officers.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking, and reliable", McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of former Newark police officer Jimmy Arroyo, currently with the Sketch Products Control Commission, and left behind two sons, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old son, and a stepdaughter.
A spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, Eileen Walsh, said investigators are working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's surgery.
"There's a high probability", Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing".
According to the authorities, he arrived at the house around 3 p.m. on November
On the 21st, and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and so far, the police have revealed very little about the investigation and the homeowner, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro was ever questioned by the detectives.
The study participants are investigating whether any part of the house functioned as a medical order.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a rotten rose tree stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian rose was boiling from behind the house.
Next to the basement door, in the driveway, was a blue tank with the inscription "Etil Vanillin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanging from the sidewalks.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York City Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping to educate her about the unusual and unflattering political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'You better watch this and that!' " she recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left at night.
It was a mess".
Expectations of Fed interest rate cuts are leading to a global stock market crash
Shares on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday after reassuring statements by the vice president of the Central Bank of America raised hopes that the Fed would seek to ease investment opportunities with further interest rate cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have been on the rise after Donald Kohn, who is the right-hand man of Fed President Ben Bernanke, said executives should respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing uncertainty in financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to calm markets amid signs of a recovering credit crisis, it stated that the current uncertainty 'partly reversed the development of the market in late September and October'.
It said that if the increased confusion continues, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The investors interpreted the statements as stating that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets or even further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The announcements have also been reassuring to Wall Street, which has recently received more bad news about the U.S. economy, including a record negative U.S. home sales.
The financial uncertainty was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will lay off 650 employees or 4% of its global workforce as part of cost reductions to offset losses in the US secondary housing sector.
The measure concerns a total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters, which employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose by 165,5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6,306,2 points, increasing the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The uncertainty in the credit market was renewed after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank brought the three-month maturity securities to European banks at a price of 4,7%, unseen since April 2001.
After the UK interbank rate, Libor, after a steady growth since 12 November, reached its highest level since September, at 6.59%, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release additional capital into the London money market.
England is calling for a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who owns the six fields of the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the immediate context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision?
The latter question is relevant, firstly, because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who is temporarily in charge of this particular task, is assisting Head Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and secondly, because the office of the English Executive Director Hugh Morris's desk is beginning to fill with applications for national or at least one selection position.
The player with the shortest bet is the one who doesn't get the sixth place, but as you know, life and especially sports are often unfair.
It is never easy to tell why someone is at the top of their profession, while others cannot surpass it even at a lower level.
It's not just cricket that has difficulty selecting, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, such as John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated young leaders who are well versed in business, when only one of them has room for decision-making.
Who can tell me what level a cricketer is at without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data can have a big impact on decision making, but options are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's eye at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batsman must be given a regular chance if he wants to become a great player.
It's a lot more complicated to catch the eyes of the selectors.
James Anderson, for example, had many better players last season, but he still looks like a reliable first-team regular, despite Stephen Harmison saying he's in good form and is hitting really well.
Anderson struggled to make the tournament with 32 first-class goals and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only scored 29, but they both had their moments of success at the highest level, and they hope to continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided by the opinions.
This decision can blow up or ruin anyone's career, but it may not have any significant impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played every Test and did well with five goals and 40 runs, but it was the then-emerging Paul Collingwood who became the outstanding and defining Test cricketer who is perhaps still underestimated today despite scoring double centuries against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their meeting at the Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, listening to Graveney, Vaughan and Moores' conservative instincts, they will cast their vote on Shah's greater experience, against Bopara's youthful vitality and dynamism.
There's arguments for both.
Shah is also a part of the 88th Bombay Test, where he made his brilliant and successful debut against Bopara, a 22-year-old six-year-old seven years his junior, who also excelled in the first-class, 32 centuries.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah scored just 10 runs in the two-quarter Test against West Indies at home in Lorda in May, and that the struggling Vaughan was immediately resisted by the selectors for his return to the next game, seems to have diminished his stamina, which was still evident in Bombay.
Faced with him, Essex's universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
On the cricket field, there's nothing to be upset about, but he did well on his off-the-field behavior when he crashed into a car sponsor car at an exhibition, a Volkswagen four-wheel drive.
He sustained minor injuries and was supposedly shocked, but the first thing he did afterwards was to take Vodafone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better-looking player with a classic, with a smooth, medium-sized throwing angle, and a confident and skilled shot.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and the right moment is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I would personally give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be outstanding if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
They're taking refugees home by bus to work and fight al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses have been arriving in Baghdad from Syria with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or their visas have expired or who are hoping to restore order to the city.
Some of them have returned to fight the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people, loaded with dozens of buses, arrived from Damascus.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said the Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because I saw on television and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he added, referring to the militia priest Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently halting his Shiite army.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from Amariyah, a predominantly Sunni city, returned home with two children because he failed to renew Syrian visas and because the Iraqi regime prevented them from taking jobs.
Amaria ski neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-backed troops, they were able to push Al Qaeda out of their base in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a shell attack at his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me they had formed an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my sons.
That's why I came back today", said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have said that since the US troops entered the capital, the peace has been strengthened and that the armed civilian forces cooperating with the US have lured them home.
Yet, many more were forced to return home from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, has voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has asked the Syrian government to reject the refugees' visa applications in order to force them to return home.
It is estimated that more than two and a half million have fled the death brigades operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and put pressure on the government to stop issuing more visas to Iraqis so they could move home", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I escaped".
One reason for the easing of violence was that Sunnis were expelled from Shia areas while Sikhs were also leaving Sunni-inhabited areas, which resulted in a decrease in tensions in many rural areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will reignite the mood, leading to further fighting.
Small Saarland - Level training
The smallest federal province is a leader in vocational training and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
In one area of training, rural Saar people struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"I explained 50 times today to people outside the Saar that we are not French", he said in his self-ironic advertising posters for the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which, according to the Cologne German Economic Institute (IW), has the fifth place.
Thus, institutions of higher education - even for the sake of tradition - cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can still graduate with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, your foreign student population is 15.6 percent.
However, Saarland's colleges and universities are also attractive to those who want to study - many of whom do not have a high school diploma.
"The opportunities for vocational training are being exploited in the Saar", explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one fifth of young people are enrolled in vocational schools, which is more than seven percent higher than the federal average in the Saar region.
The combined opportunities for vocational and higher education were also well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
"We have initiated many reforms in primary schools since the first Pisa study", said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
That's why the government introduced comparative tests nationwide.
To get kids to start school early, the last year of kindergarten is free, and this is a model that has been copied by other federal states in the meantime.
Whether students' performance will improve permanently will only be answered in future comparative studies.
The Pisa survey of 2003 showed that the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
The overall performance of the Saar Region did not improve as much as that of the other federal provinces.
Bajorans are better at counting.
The greatest outrage of the Saar people is that foreign language skills are not taken into account in the Pisa survey, otherwise they could have reaped beans in the area,
The language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools, even if the Saar people are not French.
Chavez is changing the clocks
In the near future, hours in Venezuela will be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn back the timekeeper for half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chavez has become the subject of ridicule in Spain.
As reported by the official newspaper of Venezuela, a new law allows clocks to be turned back four and a half hours from Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Among other reasons, the anti-U.S. Chavez rationale for his decision was that the U.S. forced the world to use hourly time zones.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that he had cut ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician has stated that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain any contact with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this for my own dignity", said Chávez, who is calling for a constitutional reform that oil nationals will have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With reform, he would have significantly expanded his power in the country.
The reason for the controversy was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chavez to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe "squeezed the arcul" with his decision, giving voice to Chavez's criticism on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile phone ringing has been heard in the country: "Por qué no te callas", the phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people on the Internet.
The phrase comes from King John of Spain, who at the last Latin American summit was so upset by the left-wing populist politician's constant public outcry that he cut it in his mouth.
In 2007, wages are falling
A real wage decline is forecast to threaten German workers this year despite the strong economy.
Experts have supported their pessimistic predictions for a variety of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007 employees may actually expect to receive less pay than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage developments, a general sales tax increase and rapid increases in food and energy prices", Gustav Horn, a fellow at the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research, told Bild.
Employees may also face additional burdens in the context of unemployment insurance.
In a statement to the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stated that the current situation would see the right and reasonable unemployment insurance reduced to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Office should not be put in a position to seek credit or support from the union, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the explosion in food and mineral oil prices had resulted in the highest inflation rate in 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is the Devil's twin brother to Earth
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought: The European Venus Express spacecraft detected lightning in its atmosphere and wind patterns around its corners that occur on Earth during winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there is lightning on Venus.
The European space probe Venus Express has provided evidence of electromagnetic waves at the perimeter of the atmosphere: Lightning from Venus travels from cloud to cloud in a circle about 35 miles [56 km] high, reports Christpher Russell, a fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles, on the cover of the science magazine Nature.
The famous "basal-steam theory" states that life on Earth was caused by lightning: The theory is that the thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
"If there ever was life on Venus, it must have been in very early times", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There is currently little living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is a hundred times denser than Earth's, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the twin of hell to Earth, but it's still the twin", Russel whispered.
The central question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, is moving on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the search for Venus, because no spacecraft has been on the road since the early 1990s specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research results presented in several Nature articles prove, in the researchers' opinion, that Venus is not unique only within the solar system.
"They also show that the planet's resemblance to Earth is greater than we first assumed", Esa reported.
In addition to the already known north-polar rotation wind, the researchers discovered an even faster-moving cloud rule at the south pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics and Cosmic Physics.
The second-largest planet in the solar system has a mass almost equal to that of Earth and is nearly the size of Earth, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
A celestial body, also called the Evening Star, orbits the Sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis: a day on a Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the surface temperature of Venus, at 92 degrees Fahrenheit, is barely reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under exactly the same conditions.
Both of them had water that was left on Earth as an ocean while Venus was left for the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound to carbonate substrates, on Venus, it makes up a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the end of the two-party debate that erupted around the Dalai Lama's reception in the Chancellery.
He was moderately critical of the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September vote.
President Horst Köhler of the German Republic is concerned about Germany's prestige and has called on the Grand Coalition to end the debate over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
Köhler also expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) had welcomed the Dalai Lama in September.
"I hold human rights universally valid even if I respect the diversity of cultures", Köhler stressed.
Everyone is aware that Germany must maintain a delicate foreign policy balance, the president of the republic stressed; however, Merkel defended herself against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is aware of this", Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception and thus became a target of attacks by the EU.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, of the EU's 'external policy'.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the Chancellery, there were serious disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese leadership thus not only rejected the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has just called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses to accept the Tibetan religious leader as an official by European politicians, Wen Jiabao has confirmed China's position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words indicated that he was trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan territories that include modern-day Tibet.
Schäuble is protected from riots like those in France
Street clashes with police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble avoids riots like those in France.
All efforts must be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from becoming a source of street violence, the Federal Minister for the Interior demands.
Barricades were on fire, snipers fired their guns at police: After the violent riots among young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior (CDU) Wolfgang Schäuble fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to accumulate social explosives and to turn to violence.
We must take this seriously", he told the newspaper Neue Presse in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federation, the provinces and the communities are currently working intensively to resolve the problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about immigrant integration.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already showing".
But it's too early to solve the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the urban and sociological problems of France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting violent street fights with police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also on fire.
In view of this, the German Government has called for a greater degree of integration activity from Kenan Kolat, Head of the Turkish Communities in Germany.
In the wake of the French riots, Kolat warned of the "dangers of decline".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But it's necessary to act.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "higher than average".
First of all, we should have more educational facilities.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective".
However, the Turkish Community leader added that "social supervision within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We must be firm in spite of this".
Young people "must be given the opportunity to get jobs and education as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, the night was full of silence.
Hundreds of police were standing by for duty, a helicopter was patrolling the area with a headlight.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the reporting, a security unit of 1,000 people has been providing security.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Beau.
The following night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The damage was caused by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
The state prosecutor's office has made no initial finding that the police are responsible for the deaths of the youth.
In the Kingdom of the Clouds
The Chancellor's act of deception is evidence that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing is expected of him.
What country does the federal chancellor actually live in?
The fact that the Bundestag has been ignorant and indifferent in its content to the general debate is that it is not here - it is not in the country where it is his job to govern.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation with a very arrogant sentence, saying she would focus too much on foreign policy.
It's provincial, he replied, and in this way he was only expressing that he doesn't want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how much eye-catching it is.
Meanwhile, there was no concrete interest or empathy in the country's problems.
Instead, she emerged as Cloudflare Angela, a politically-focused, unreality-ridden politician who fled to foreign policy, where she was left with only uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: He boasted tirelessly about the Heiligendam Limits, but he kept quiet about how the country should achieve climate goals.
In general, as far as self-respect is concerned, such a degree of modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU's president two years earlier.
Now he's stuck with the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This damages his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems instead of word flowers.
But in the kingdom of the overwhelming Angela, domestic political problems are only secondary.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
You'll only be able to say a few half-words.
It is a common sight in this regard to see how often he stumbles on family allowances.
Merkel has to push three times to put together a half-long, straightforward sentence.
When it comes to concrete, he's scratching in a foreign field.
The fucking department.
The Republican presidential candidates' YouTube debate has seen a hard-fought battle between the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and now they must beware of an outsider candidate.
The tensions among the candidates have already been high on the first issue.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York a "hideout for illegal immigrants".
Contrasting serious facts on his part, Giuliani replied, "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants", and he blamed the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as a private individual.
Candidates are on the move: Since the Republican camp still has no consistent favorite, the eight mayoral candidates are using the CNN debate in public to undermine their opponent's credentials.
Self-directed 30-second videos posted by Internet users on YouTube are little more than brief summaries.
"This kind of isolationism has brought Hitler to power", John McCain squeezes his opposing side, Ron Paul, who is the only one of the group to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, a Vietnam veteran, is also thoroughly brainwashed when he hesitates to condemn so-called "waterboarding" as torture, the interrogation method that simulates drowning.
The public reaction to the campaign is that the main themes of the campaign are beyond the debate on Iraq and torture.
There's a loud applause in the room when conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the two candidates' weaknesses are becoming increasingly apparent.
"I was wrong then", Romney repents, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for voting against abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is slanderous when asked about his view of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first rules as a civilian
One day after the withdrawal of the army, Musharraf was sworn in as the ruling president of Pakistan.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamic State presidential palace.
Musharraf has sworn an oath to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyan, allowing international pressure from the United States to come first.
After eight years of bloodless military coup attempt, the former general is now governing for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf has met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath to fulfill the West's further demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which had appointed Musharraf's sympathetic lawyers in early November after the state of emergency was declared, rejected all protests last week over the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, an attack on a military convoy in northern Uzbekistan, a tribal area, killed five soldiers and wounded four others.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are Back
The German supergroup of the '70s is playing again, and the three members of Harmonia have again crushed their instruments to the brim of a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the reunion, a taping of their heyday, Live 1974, appears.
They were already well known abroad at the time.
The reported sensation was a body snatched from three agreed gentlemen walking around the dinner table.
Each has its own sound, its own cable, and most importantly, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, in a snow white shirt, sitting in the middle of the throne.
Michael Rother, 57, from the left, is escorting a laptop and guitar.
Looking at the audience, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is curling and focusing on the console.
Each one of them makes a certain kind of noise, and then it's a rhythm.
And all of this is sometimes sort of coincidentally classical music.
However, the masters themselves seem to be not particularly disturbed by this.
It was a great thrill for Krautrock fans to see Harmonia back on the road.
What we can tell you is that, as a result of proper investigation, the name has been passed down through the collective pop culture, but it has never left a lasting mark that we miss this band so painfully after 32 years.
But why not celebrate the legends of the Germans of the seventies?
Especially since what we mistakenly call krautrock has always been more appreciated in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award to the surviving members of the band Can in 2003, German pop stars sat in the room with their faces unseen.
When he even thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in his Red Hot Chili Peppers tribute, the wonder was unbounded.
And then, at the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old buddy.
Homeland rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The only reason the memory is overwhelmed by the Harmonia is that the trio only existed for two years, and during that time, they had far less impact than others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously performed with Conrad Schnitzler and artists under the promising name Cluster.
They originally played in the basement of the Schaubühne theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a church-funded record label.
Rother briefly helped found Kraftwerk, and in parallel, he made a name for himself as the guitarist of perhaps the most radical German band of the time, Neu!.
However, around 1973, Rother accompanied the Cluster musicians to their exile in the Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Roman, they lived as communal fugitives from the city.
Less ideologically oriented than in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still struggling as a babysitter.
Our lives are more like idyllic art.
The Harmonia Ottenstein's flag was said to have been pulled from the trash and thus they have given their art a name.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is "De Luxe".
Despite its loose and modest music, the band was in financial need.
The gathering of the crowd alone did not ensure their finding.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded at a concert in Griesham in front of a record-breaking audience of just 50 people, so someone remembers.
Enforcing the harmony and occasional practice was Rother's idea back then.
To Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother was a esoteric and self-sufficient record producer, like "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has been more successful than Harmonia ever has been.
The live album from Greece is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label, named Greenland, set out to care for krautrock as a distinctive German subgenre of live music.
In this context, Neu! was produced in the same way as Roedelius' solo work.
The resurrection of the Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of Culture.
Cashed in as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the British Aboriginal and author of the book "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
And there's also the Loveparade's creator, Dr. Motte.
All of this roughly outlines the impact of krautrock on the next pop era.
In this respect, Harmonia is filling the vacancy reserved for the Super Team.
Brian Eno's statement floats with the most unusual voices in the room: "The only true music, his future".
There are pictures of the producer in a room in a farmhouse with Harmony.
Additional black and white photographs of the cable-stayed equipment are serving to build a legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are back in the improvisation business.
It simply means that microphones are being recorded for the organ and drum kit with the intention of using the instruments to produce unheard-of sound effects from their own scabbed sound effects.
Today, electric music is like electric music.
Three, deep-rooted, technical barber.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and kiss and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or even the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "68", they're not going the wrong way, and that's why Harmonia won't let you get away with it right now.
Even the most obvious thing is being thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does the music start and end?
It can make you nervous or it can make you feel like you're having a moment of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through "Tradition" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films are repeatedly dealing with the Balkan War.
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much action and shooting or too emotional.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help with the "Dedication".
First, the good news is that while the two war criminals, Karadzsics and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they have found the actor, Richard Gere, once again, right there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian war.
Recently, we've lost sight of the most beautiful man of the '80s, for his many good-natured roles in emotional women's films and his many Buddhist press conferences that even took our interest from us to be a rapper.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument that we might even see the movie "The Deed".
It's a wonderful, smiling portrayal: Basically, the Simon Hunt warlord he portrayed is exactly what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so gracious to him: a man who has long since left behind his finest years, but his decay as a monstrous monument has preserved much of his former appeal.
However, the film "The Surrender" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also began airing this week, continue to be a series of failed films about the Balkan War.
The film is about two German soldiers (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovar snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
While it is welcome that this time the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film that carries the vividness of the TV movies is too quickly lost in the shootings and the action scenes.
He carries the Cobra 11 symbol, not the highway, but the war.
In contrast, it is the "Tradition" that illustrates why not a single really good film about the Balkan War has been made.
The story of three U.S. warlords who go round to find the Serbian war criminal named "Roka" with another director, another screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) at another time, perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now".
The stories show a striking similarity: In both cases, small groups cut through the forest to accomplish what the army cannot - and in both cases, the journey to madness is unfolding.
One reason the "Death" failed is simply because it doesn't allow Simon Hunt to be the heart-wrenching cynic you're introducing him to.
No, and in the script, he even has a romantic relationship with a Muslim bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"Tradition" is finally slipping away when reporters in the final five minutes of the film, in the form of accelerated filming, achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's warheads have failed to do in five years: arrest a war criminal and hand him over to the Mohammedans for just revenge.
It's so bad that one would most likely go to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to claim that Karadzsics and Mladic are still at large, and to suspect the Americans and the French (who are still allegedly exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that one can think of a famous Brecht verse.
In it, the poet writes of the famous Asian demon depicted at his desk: "I look with a part at the dying herd that tells me how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies like "Deligion" have the same oversized, human-headed masks, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan wars.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were a disgusting failure.
To add to this, there hasn't been a good movie about South Africa.
It's almost always true that when a star roams the world's crises or minefields, something like "On the Paths of Freedom" by Patricia Arquette, "No Limit" by Angelina Jolie, or "The Blood Diamond" by Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
It took them decades to make a good Hollywood movie about the Holocaust with Schindler's List.
Some films are likely to be in the works - even those that are now considered classics of the Vietnam War, such as The Lion King, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket, were not universally celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it's possible that nowadays, when all the mass killings are coming to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the screenwriters of ignoring the reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
"To Be or Not to Be" or "The Dictator" did so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin hadn't yet realized how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be trying to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should be in the sarcastically distant artistic view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière Lexicon" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be terribly murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is being heavily criticized for canceling the Olympics
The mayor's isolation from his bid to host the Hamburg Summer Olympics has drawn intense criticism from the political and economic circles.
Many want to keep fighting for the water games.
Von Beust, however, warns of the realities in his chance study.
The Director-General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described the withdrawal as 'unfavourable to the economic environment'.
No other project has unleashed such a powerful motivational force in the city lately as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, we cannot maintain the level playing field of sport policy".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project but to develop a long-term initiative "starting with modified timetables".
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted on his previous statements that his ambitions for the Hamburg Olympics are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not yet received any information on the results of the competition.
"To us, this means that we will not have a realistic opportunity in the time frame we have been thinking about until 2028".
We're not giving up on our dreams, however, von Beus said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has expressed its regret over von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of competing in the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to waste an opportunity by burying our plans now", said Günter Ploß, HSB president, on Wednesday.
The withdrawal of the tender is also contrary to the statement by the President of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German Association for the Sport of Colleges.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission has not yet established the possibility of a new competition in the field of the 'European competitive football' in the context of the 'European competitive football' programme.
The College Sports Association only last week launched Hamburg as a city in the tender.
The SPD's civic faction blamed the Senate for wasting valuable time on Hamburg housing.
"The Senate has been holding back the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years because it voted for the Olympics and ignored housing", said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has consistently supported the Kleiner Grasbrook's integrated plan for Olympic and subsequent residential use, the CDU has unilaterally focused on the 'event factor'.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics was a huge success in Hamburg.
However, he failed in Hamburg Lipchen.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and the countryside is thinking of Ike, not Andy Warhol.
Or did he?
Currently, Swedish-made murals cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
The 94 "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box listed here is mostly fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes for several months, an internal investigation into the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now yielded a positive result: six copies of the "Brillo Box" donated by Pontus Hultén, former museum director, to Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely a hundred other "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box in the wheels on sale in international art markets.
The prehistory is a long and complicated, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial displays.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxait" in New York City in 1964, painted murals based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" soap powder box.
At a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes were unveiled: these (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol but were shipped directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't artwork, it was templates, simple exhibits.
However, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo villages in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the day now speak in circles of fifteen boxes that were then authenticated as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the "Stockholm-type" designation and entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them were sold for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred walls were made and displayed in wheels in Sweden, which he left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 for a St. Petersburg exhibition in Malmö.
But by this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish private-owned boxes, including three Brillo Boxes, which were made in Stockholm in 1968.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the plating without a foundation, with a painting loop, and that it was not oil but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authenticated by the artist, and should therefore be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet. "The Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York will not rule otherwise, and Moderna Museet will select the six boxes in its collection as copy/exhibition material".
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it was investigating "serious charges" in connection with soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been wrapped up in unspoken silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila surrender
The rebellion in the Philippines was abandoned by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, hotel manager Antonio Trillanes told reporters, accusing the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, the hotel was raided by guerrilla soldiers who were injecting tear gas.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half the team was brought to trial on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly break a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were tasked with guarding the man, apparently switched to him and joined the rebellion.
They raided the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have sealed off the premises of the prestigious hotel.
The president's called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales has condemned the military's actions.
"They've had enough of people", Trillanes said.
"We invite people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, formerly the leader of the elite Scout Rangers, stated that other units of the army were willing to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been under cover of corruption charges for months.
The financial district of Manila was the main stage of the 2003 military raid against Arroyo, organised by 200 members.
The uprising failed just 24 hours later when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven attempted coups have taken place in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in the Venture
United Internet has secured itself a 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
As stated on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is EUR 14,46.
This represents 20.05% of the capital.
There was speculation about the acquisition before that.
The possibility of raising a share of the assets acquired in the Competition shall remain open.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market for DSL in Germany.
Prior to this, speculation had been raised on Wednesday about a possible switch-on after Berenberg Bank raised its stake in the Düsseldorf network provider by a further 5% to 15.1%.
The financial institution only holds the stake to a third party, it's notorious in the money market.
The day before, United Internet had a narrow 10% stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
From this, United Internet acquired 5,15 million shares for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a United-Internet spokesman.
The two companies jointly established MSP as a joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
The two companies initially settled for a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and did not live up to the right to take an additional 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all the possibilities open, in particular to increase their stake in Freenet AG, the news is that.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
Freenet's month-long and now-exhaustive poker game is part of the German telecommunications market consolidation.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1,27 million DSL and wireless customers.
The holding company, formed by United Internet and Drillisch, has previously held a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now, we've agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional four percent.
An agreement on the right to acquire 18,49% of Vatas Investment Company was reached in August.
