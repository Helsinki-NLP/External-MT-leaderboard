Welsh AMs concerned about 'looking like unskilled'
Some AMs are hampered by suggestions that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that it could invite ridicule.
A Labor AM said their group was concerned, it is sung with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp means daft in Welsh and pwp means poo.
A plaid AM said the whole group was not happy and suggested changes.
A Welsh Conservative said that their group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that it was a short verbal hop for the Muppet from the MWP.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English U
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to introduce the name change, said: "A final decision on which workers are called to the members of the Assembly becomes necessary for their members to have a case".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal in which the Assembly had broad support to call a Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
The AMs are clearly suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to gain consensus may be difficult for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, who hopes to submit draft legislation on the change within weeks.
The reform law will include further changes in the way the Assembly functions, including the rules on the design of the AAM's disqualification and committee arrangements.
When they debate the law, they will have the final vote on the question of what they should say.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A public vote was set up to resolve Greece's decades-long dispute, with its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to one of its territories and has repeatedly objected to its membership bills for the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov has told opponents of the referendum on the name change that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Bells of St. Martin fall silent in churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the ancient people I have spoken to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner.
Today there is no one here.
He said that the disappearance of the twelve comes in
He said, "Nowadays people socialize in a different way.
Bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood where people go regularly.
For the churches he worries that there will be no money left from the sale of property unless the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will be back to where they started".
He said churches could be replaced with apartment buildings, where they are filled with people who did not help the other shelters in the neighborhood.
Many people who buy condominiums in these buildings will become white, and so soon the day will come when these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who go to these condominiums will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by whites before becoming St. Martin's, a black metropolitan community in Harlem in the 1870s.
The original white Methodist congregation had moved out in the 1930's
A group of black people who worshiped nearby took title to the building
St. Martin's was taken over by a group of black people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem that opposed hiring or advertising black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's pastor hired Carlin to rebuild it as he planned to.
Johnston's son and successor to St. Martin, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell"
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a durable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also notes that the world's first carillon was played by a black musician, Denisio A. Lind, who moved to the large carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Shri Merivadhar said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played out at St. Martin's over the past few months remains a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, and others by the Episcopal vicarage.
Composed of lay leaders, the Vestry - the governing body of Paris - in the Sub-Region expressed concern that the sub-Region was not involved in recruiting the buildings and contractors sent to the Sub-Region, with the desire to pass on the vestry along with the costs.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the province
A 13-year-old boy injured by a shark attack at a lobster dive in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for lobster on the first day of lobster season in California.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWT in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and then pedalled with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said at first that he thought it was a great thrill to catch a lobris, but then he "felt it was screaming, 'I've learned a little!'
I learned a little!
All her gums were open after she was cut", Hamal said when she once saw the boy.
I warned everyone to get out of the water: Hamel said. 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was taken to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was unknown
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles, giving a brief speech to a media, said a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was certain that it was not an endangered species of shark.
Giles added to the victim's injuries from the wound in his upper torso area.
The authorities have stopped visiting the beautiful beach from Casaballad to Ponto Beach in Swasthani's Ekstasa for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market.
Snesbury is taking department store-style beauty estates with boots, superdrugs and debynhams working with specialist assistants.
As part of a significant capital investment into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which is growing steadily as fashion and homewear sales return, the large beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Once the investment in beauty is put to the test for TVs, microwaves and homeware, it comes as a supermarket hunt for ways to use shelf space.
Sainsbury said it will double its beauty size to 3,000 products, including Revlon, SC, Tweedgerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing categories from L'Oreal, Mabelline and Bourget Bees will have more space with branded areas as found in shoe shops.
The supermarket is re-launching its boutique makeup range to make most products vaginally-compatible - sometimes demanded by small shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is exploring discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, which opened last week in Croydon, south London while a second one in Sew Oak, Birmingham, opened later this year.
A shift towards online shopping and buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that people will have to do more to convince them to visit supermarkets.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Cappe has said outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters LD and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced several housing units after buying both girls two years ago which is said to have increased grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous efforts of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended up with a tie-up of how to distribute its pharmaceuticals in its own supermarkets in its registry stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury leather brands including La Roche-Pose and Medici in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty salons to increase access for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our brand range is tailored to meet every need and the favourable environment and convenient locations mean that we are now on a great beauty floor that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'angries' after Holly Wilfbee pulls out of $11 million deal
Dragon's Day star Peter Jones leaves 'Angry' to leave TV presenter Holly Willoughby to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV in a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business
Willybie really has no time for her home furnishings and trolley brand
This business pair was merged with Gwyneth Paltrow's GUP brand
This morning the speaker, 37, announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Dan star Peter Jones in his final years to focus on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taking him out of his lifestyle luxury business
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of its business empire in the town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deal - worth up to £1.5m - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to her home appliances and accessories brand Truely.
The business was merged with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goup brand and she was asked to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby (37), announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones has moved out of England for one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly, the top of the slow priority was top of the list.
It was looking at her long-term future, which she would look at over the next two decades.
The decision to evacuate the rest of the people was completely blocked
No one was believing what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
A warehouse at Marlowe headquarters is filled up and ready for sale.
Experts believe that the morning presenter, who is among the most trusted stars in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to the heavy investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and its launch is likely to be further delayed.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willaby and husband Don Baldwin, Jones and his wife Tara Cap have been married for nearly ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couple vacationing together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm
Willy Beebe has become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlan as ITV's ISA Celebrity
A source close to Jones said he would "not comment on his business affairs".
We had a hard time communicating and then we fell in love.
He joked about some media outlets considering him "unidentified" and positive about the North Korean leader's criticism for commenting.
Why has President Trump given such a priority?
Trump mocks in the voice of a "news anchor"
"I left nothing behind".
He noted that after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, when Kim was interested in a second meeting, Trump stepped up to take up North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearisation talks were closed.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top ambassador, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not seeing "an appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial denuclearization move.
Instead, he noted, the US has continued sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump brought another optimistic outlook in his rally speech
He said, "We're doing great with North Korea",
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions have been killed
Now we have these deepened ties.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning American troops home to escape.
And he preserves his unusual attitude in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out trying to get into this packed arena, we have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd.
Indonesia Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed
Although 10 percent of the population of Lambayeque had been displaced, no national disaster had been declared, a first step needed to generate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Ms Sumung said.
While a team is being formed to travel to Palu to rescue the children, it is not yet known if foreign workers can work on the ground.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation of Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief.
The earth is shaken by what Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is suffering greatly from natural disasters
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ash, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning alarm in Plu, although a warning was in effect, was likely to contribute to the loss of life.
In good times, traveling to many countries in Indonesia is challenging
Natural disasters make rubber more complex
A hospital plane is being deployed to Lambayeque to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's flattering infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has squandered money on roads and railways
But a lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's administration as he runs for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko has also faced pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority people embrace a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets using mortars, arrows and other raw weapons
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool Dips the deep equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was passed by Sachin Shakiri as he was scoring with his team to a 30-yard Golden Trophy.
He would tap the ball to his left before taking a shot towards the back.
This effort rose above the box as it moved towards the right corner of the net.
The ball had finally jumped from a coupon arisabalaga and moved into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, being on the ball and players like Shaq always play it as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as I could myself", Stroud told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the thorn coming and I made a touch and didn't think much about it and just shot it.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Edin Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker passed Mateo Kovacic on that play, before cutting close to Metaferro and entering the Liverpool half.
Kovacic performed at a fast pace in midfield.
He then threw a beautiful ball at Blake, which took Hazard into the box.

The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Agency spokesman Stiepo Purowo Noroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the collapse of buildings caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and agents spokesman Stiepo Purowo Noroho said:

Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a knife wound at Grazen Mouse on Jorn Street at 7.55am, the 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police appealed to people in the areas to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area at Burnham Head to contact us".
I would appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have captured anything on the dashcam photo to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
In the afternoon friends who believe they know the woman have arrived on the occasion to ask questions about where she met this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police have said that they are in the process of notifying the relative of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mouse recently tried to go to his home although no one is being told by police to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he was stunned.
At present, residents are being told that they will not be allowed to return for a long time.
A police officer was heard saying that the entire area is now seen as a crime zone.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
She repeatedly says, 'It is terrible.
At 2 pm two police vans were parked inside the cordon and another outside.
Several officers stood within the cordon to inspect blocks of flats.
Anyone with information, anyone can ask DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or speak to Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111 referring to the 30 September infection 247.
The statue of the Parliament of Comwell became the latest monument to the 'rewrite of history'.
The dismissal would do justice to their criticism of the Taliban as the vast traditions created by England's socially and religiously antiquated upper-class Scheduled Castes.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Sunsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current discussion about removing the statues it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The statue of the English Common Wars was neither ordered nor completed by Cromwell.
Cromwell sacrificed himself for the activities of the ancestor Thomas in the last century
Sir William Hamo Throncroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to the nineteenth-century opinion and the part of a picture's historiography that many believe is to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being advised by many more people in his monarchical affairs, as a protection of Parliament from outside pressure, in the late 19th century than today".
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the war of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Crowell is a personally identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance".
Killer pig mole killed Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that the man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead in a market in Lipansui, Guizhou province, with a severe arterial wound, which was covered in blood.
A pig farmer vaccinates pigs in a pig pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
He allegedly came from the neighboring Greek region with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and found a door to open a nearby pigsty.
He said that there was a large male pig in the ward with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a legal investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig caused the farmer to die.
My cousin's legs were stained with blood, and his cousin referred to him as "Wo", according to the Guizhang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan going to the market to feed his pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was not John's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking another person while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating for compensation on his death.
Although rare before, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the person to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran into a Welsh farmer in a tractor until he was driven away by his wife.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not particularly aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just getting chatty.
They are naive, curious... they are not out to hurt you.
You need to keep them in the right way", he said.
Hurricane Roza remnants will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern US.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it hovers over the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the roza will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, the sun is expected to move north
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is taking shape above and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa reaches the Baja California mainland on Monday as a tropical depression, it will begin to push deeper tropical depression into the north, northern Southwestern U.S. as a hurricane.
The rains will increase to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the combination of tropical humidity with condensed humidity will lead to heavy rainfall in the South-Western region in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall due to hot tropical humidity will reach rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in parts of the southwest, especially Arizona
The scattered flow of rain is likely to cause flooding with adverse conditions soon.
It is very useless to advise to go out into the desert on foot at the risk of torrential rain.
Heavy rainfall will cause violent rivers to form in the valley and thunderstorms will cause locally strong winds and dust to blow.
Imminent tropical storm will bring some locally heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline
Rainfall of up to half inch is possible, which will reduce debris flow and cause slippery roads.
This will be the first rain of that summer season.
Some scattered remnants of the tropical monsoon will reach Arizona before Monday late Sunday and, before that, rainfall will become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to four corners on Tuesday and Wednesday will be the last day.
Temperatures may be somewhat extreme over the US in October as the Arctic cools, although summers remain very warm.
Sometimes this indicates extreme changes in temperature in a short period of time.
The foci on Sunday are an incredible example of the extreme variation in temperatures across the U.S.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, efforts will be made to rebuild and expand the summer heat.
Most of Central and Eastern America is likely to see the onset of summer in early October, while the northeastern parts of the Northeast, in the 80s, are likely to see the onset of summer in early October.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, ten degrees above average.
Our long-term environmental forecast is showing a high probability of better than expected temperatures through the main part of October in the eastern U.S.
Brent Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people
The lead-up to the Supreme Court nomination of Brent Cavanhoon and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s was watched by more than 20 million people on the Six Television Network on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: The Arizona Senate drew up an agreement with the FBI to investigate for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that drugged Kavan.Ho caught him and tried to strip him at a secondary school party.
In a spirited testimony, Kavanagh said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It was likely seen by more than 20.4 million people than reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The organization was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has often had trouble predicting the people he sees in offices.
To put it in that perspective, the number of spectators is similar to a playoff football game or an Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose popular hosts have strongly sponsored Kavanaugh's arrangement, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's was with 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.8 million and CNN's with 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest is high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the play Friday.
The moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, who was being watched by CNN and CBS cameras by non-conformists on Friday morning as he tried to ride the elevator at a judicial committee hearing.
He stood for a very short time with his eyes disappointed as if he had been bullied by a live broadcast on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing here in front of you".
"Do you believe he is telling the country the truth?
She was told, "You have power where other women don't have power".
Flake said his office had issued an announcement and said, "Before the elevator closes, he will have more to say to the committee".
The cable and broadcast networks were showing the entire program live after hours, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kwanhao's nomination in the full Senate.
But Flex said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats are appealing.
Flake was joined in the discussion by his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Fleck had the strength in the election, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kwan Hoan without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kwan Hoang.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future on leaving the EU, and accused national interests of being undermined in a Sunday Times newspaper interview.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another meeting with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson repressed the attack on his so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should pool each other's tariffs was "completely vague".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest Deaton Simpson, suspect in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting attack of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officials showed a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, a CBS member reported to WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to targeting Wade.
According to the lawyer's reports his bond has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head between the neck and the head.
Departments Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and area citizens are assisting in the investigation to make arrests.
LSU athletic head Joe Allewane thanked the area for "seeking law and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 ft 6 in forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball consultant Wade said the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
The volcano is burning in Mexico City
Lava from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after waves rose from the volcano's head and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre was testing for thunder and tremors with many clouds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in neighborhoods like ZochiMilco in Mexico City.
Geologists have seen an increase in activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that shook central Mexico in July 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-freedom protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands of people joined protests to watch the main event of Catalonia's Polvarization vote.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held by terror police, threw paint and powder at them, leaving black clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
There was hand-to-hand fighting later in the day and the police used their batons to participate in the fight.
During several hours after independence, chanting "No mistakes, no apologies", federal protesters shouted, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the assembly cases, local press reported.
October is considered illegal by Madrid through referendum but tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters cast a large number of votes to become independent, although voter turnout was small with isolated settlers but a large portion of the vote was boycotted
According to Catholic officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after attempts to block votes from being cast at all polling stations in the region were blocked by violent clashes last year.
Pro-Azodie groups camped out overnight on Friday to stop a demonstration in support of the national police.
The exhibition moved on but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termas (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist radical's involvement with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite narrow victories in regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year as many of their well-known leaders await trial for their role in organising a referendum on self-determination or detention and even after the next declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who protested in support of the police on his phone, said the clashes had been stopped by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", he said.
On Saturday, Oliol Zuccoraz, who was among the nine Catalan pioneers who had participated in facilitating the pre-initiation reforms until the end of last year, said he would fight for European parties next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the exception to democratic values and oppression, we have learned from the Spanish government", he said.
LONDONDERREY: Man arrested for crashing car into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being thrown into a house after a vehicle was repaired in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Ballynagar Crescent.
Det Insp Bob Blemings said the doors and building were damaged.
A car could be fired on on the side of a road.
Manga Strait won 1-0 against Livingston Rangers
Livingstone manga's first goal secured for the win
The promoted Livingstone turned down Rangers' appointment of Steven Gerrard to manage the Ibrox club, only their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Minga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary's side went with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remained without success in the Premiership this season and led the losing leaders Hearts by 8 points the following Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continues to move into the division for six entertainments to extend his run, with head coach Holt tasting defeat after the return of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed the opportunity of blunt tourists.
Holt's team should have moved on some time before scoring, the Rangers faced many problems due to their obvious qualities.
Scott Robinson ended his efforts on his goal at this point Alan Lithgow could only direct his work, after which he slid to target Craig Hawke's title shot.
The hosts were content to have the Rangers play in front of them, and they knew they could upset the visitors in small parts.
And this was the way that the important goal was achieved.
Rangers surrendered a free-kick and Livingstone made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up the manga, scoring from a fountain and box focal point.
At that stage, the Rangers had surrounded the ownership although they had found home defence difficult and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely stable,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended Cali.
Sick Pitman deprived Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow of the leg to prevent the leg from claiming to be blown by a quarter from Livingston set play.
Parr came into the Livingstone box consistently and played it consistently, while two penalty kicks - after a substitute Glenn Middleton, and a helical test for handball - took second.
'Authentic' from Livingstone - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony MacArthur Arena
Excellent performance and result for Livingstone.
For a man, they were wonderful, pushing this desire up the road.
His style of play and players rarely change as he reaches the top, but still the credits that he has to separate that team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcutt was marshaling the guard while saving in a very brilliantly organized fashion, while Minga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell on their feet.
The Rangers lacked motivation, however.
As the Gimbels have been subject to Gerard now and again, they missed the lack of those standards.
They were short of the last ball - they only cut the home field in one inning - and that's a reminder to Rangers, who got it in the half-table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smilies and blue skies on Saturday (September 29), while the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by German President Erdogan - aimed at normalizing relations between NATO allies.
He has spoken on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's advancement to the European Union.
Erdogan then led Cologne to open a large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters flocked to meet their president.
Hundreds of Andron anti-protesters - many of them Kurds - also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome his country.
The expression bilateral revolt, welcomed by some German Turks as a hero, denotes the division of a visitor and control by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist dies in London after being hit by a vehicle.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 BST in the south-east of the city, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and provided medical assistance but the cyclist died at the scene
About a mile away from Saturday's accident, another cyclist was killed in a hit and run on Children's Street.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were trying to identify the man and notify his close relatives.
There are road closures and bus diversions and motorists are advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disturbance
Six prison officers were injured in the chaos at a high security men's correctional facility, the prison official said.
The disturbance ended at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at Bassist at around 09:30 BST on Sunday.
Officials from the Specialist "Toronto" have gathered to manage the disorder, which includes eight prisoners and one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service representative said: A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and they can spend a long time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison representative had been treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October a year ago, riot police officers were called to the jail to deal with a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (market areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to make landfall in Arizona, but the remainder of the hurricane's day is likely to occur southwest of the desert early next week as the remaining energy tracks that could pose a flood risk.
The National Weather Service reported flood possibilities for western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, including urban areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The roundabout could move into late rain on Monday and take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that a single "ten tropical storm has maintained hurricane or hurricane status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the boundary of AZ".
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches variing in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to reach 1 to 2 inches, with a possible low of 4 inches.
Beyond the fire hazard, the daily rainfall could be a gift as these districts were dry
Although flooding is a matter of deep concern, part of this rainfall will likely be valuable as dry weather conditions are currently coming in in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, less than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest level of classification, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to a landfill across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at storm quality on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, was moving north at 12 mph at 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific Ocean and is slowly cooling in this way.
It expects to make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may experience very heavy rainfall, indicating a risk of a major flood.
"Weather.com reported that" 3 to 6 inches of rain are likely from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches of rain possible".
Rosa will traverse northward into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical storm on Tuesday morning, passing through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The primary risk from expected daily or heavy rainfall is Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
It is dependent on rainfall to cause dangerous flooding and debris flows in the desert and rock slides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four killers arrested
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the attempted murder of a 16-year-old man in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found in a wounded condition at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the area of Excelser Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested from the Roadstock area overnight.
The officials have appealed to all those who may have footage on mobile phones to come forward.
Trump says Kwan-hoon faced the "sin, the hypocrisy, the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kwanhao is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's strategies of brutality and oppression", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kwanhof faced "the whimsy, the anger of the Democratic Party" during his nomination process.
Kwanhuff testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation that Christine Blasey Ford was dating decades ago when she was young.
Ford also testified at his arraignment hearing
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's intelligence and character and courage that day.
"The vote for Judge Cavanhoun is a vote for the most capable legal confirmation of our time, a legislator with a fine record of public service", she told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly hinted at Kwan Hoon's nomination, speaking of the importance of the Republican Party vote in the midterm elections.
"We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives".
He said, "I'm not fighting, but I'm really fighting".
"That is why I am fighting for the greatest candidates everywhere"
Trump argued that the Democrats' goal is to "opposed and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is likely to take place after Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Indonesian earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll rises
Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, killing at least 384 people, with huge waves washing up on the coast, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Plough when six metres (18 ft) high waves swept east in the evening, resulting in many deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was raised yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the coast and did not leave immediately and they were hit", said a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, logs, houses, threw everything to the ground. Nagaroh said the tsunami had reached a speed of 800 km (497 mph) on the open sea before reaching the coast.
They said, "Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive".
About 16,700 people were sent to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque was flooded.
The storm continued in the coastal city on Saturday after tremors.
Area with 2.4 million people felt the earthquake's tremors.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's earthquake was nearly 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's been said that the geography of a city that sits at the end of a long, narrow bay can increase the size of a tsunami.
Negroho described the damage as "widespread", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
They said 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, some of the victims' bodies were found under collapsed buildings.
The deaths and destruction occurred in an area called Dongola, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, near the epicenter of the earthquake, said Nguroho.
"We have lost contact with Dongla completely, so we have no information".
More than 300,000 people are living there", the Red Cross said in a statement, with its staff and volunteers moving to the affected areas.
It said, "It is a tragedy, but it could be worse".
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves were timely and had been forewarned.
Amateur footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building could hear the tsunami warning from the screams of people standing in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water broke on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
The routers were not able to instantly verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami raised a major power surge, cutting off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities have begun sending needed aid in cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but victims still need more food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed till the end of October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami toll is over 800.
This is so bad.
Although the staff of World Vision in Dongola have made it safely to Palu City, where employees are taking shelter in the shelter of tarpaulins in their office yard, they pass disastrous scenes along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said, "They told me that they saw many destroyed houses.
This is so bad.
Aid groups started their relief efforts with serious obstacles, with some complaining that foreign aid workers with deep experience were being prevented from reaching the village.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from abroad can only begin once the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Alia Ariana, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster, we can get international help but there is no such situation yet.'
As in the second night in Palo on Friday after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of JV missing persons hope that their loved ones will have the miracles that will ferment the vague stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been buried under the rubble with her mother's body for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, who were hiding in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were some of his students, including Mii Mandagi.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gandon explained how news of the collapse of the paragliding hotel spread to the public, he sent WhatsApp messages to the beach festival participants.
However their messages were the result of grey checkmarks rather than blue checks.
He said "I think the messages were not delivered",
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM rifle raid on Newport on Levi's
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from Bronx workers refilling ATMs on Levi's in Newport on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to take more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the newspaper.
When he was seized, another man "ran up behind the brink employee" and stole a bag of money kept for delivery.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Y
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He is commonly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Yea for some time and has been used as a moniker for her eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was hoping to launch his new album, Yandy.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who was "cancelled for emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
In addition to being a shortening of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'yea' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am me, this is ours.
He went from Kenai, which means only, our good, our bad, our confusion, the one reflection of everything is just Jehu.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several popular rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced his preference for the name of love and brotherly love.
A former Western colleague, Jay-Z, also made it with or without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody struggle against the students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Taltelco Plaza that "he will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
The military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people as leftist students took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans who are studying and opening other free universities by offering monthly subsidies to those who are.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract youngsters to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its AI funding.
Investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more agile in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research spending in this area.
After comments from various parts of the US government, AI policy has been announced, although the US as a whole lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, Li said.
Lee said in an interview this week that doubling funding could both double the chances that the next big AI acquisition will be in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the leading AI companies in China.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Athlete Othello and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted the last U.S. government technology competition, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge, and asked what the next step would be so that he could beat the next one.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
Lee said, "It's not China that's pushing academic leaders away; it's corporations".
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university minds to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. scale up its AI efforts.
I think a PhD in AI should be offered green cards automatically.
The State Council of China released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that fund U.S. researchers, provides funding to academics, but the quality of Chinese academic work is low, says Li.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence agency, which means involving industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence department for select committees.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation creating a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not seen action for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday for the Republic of North Macedonia, a step to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and confirms its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change will weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-pluralistic population.
President Gezevor Ivanov has said he did not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the vote will meet at least 50 percent of the votes needed to be valid for the referendum.
Referendum Question: Do you agree to the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zave, argue that, as Yugoslavia is one of the countries emerging from the collapse, Macedonia must pay to enter organizations like the EU and NATO.
Oliveira Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje; "I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us.
Although not legally bound, several MPs have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make a decision
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there have been no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjos Tnevsky, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje said: "I came to vote because of my children. Our place is in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dashko held their referendum vote in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov, was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of a tent set up by the referendum boycotters.
Kvadarkov said, "We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the door of service.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonians, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian solidarity".
Prime Minister Zeev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO", Zeev said after his vote.
He said "Yes" and the result would be "Our future confirmation".
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is less than the required voting.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said, yes, they would vote for the president.
A referendum must have one vote more than 50 per cent to be successful.
The failure of the referendum marks the first serious policy stance of the Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City leads all of Brighton to the safety goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling secured the title with a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero made the score ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass on midfield early in the order.
Before he got on the field, he ran through three Brighton defenders.
Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender before Brigan ran further to the edge of the box.
He then went to the left, to find Sterling.
First, the English used their first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot that went right into the middle of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet".
We talked about playing him for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky, he scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Stirling who gave the Sky Blues their first ever Premier League advantage.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero gets the ball deep in the Brington area in this game.
He threw a beautiful ball from Leroy Sen's left.
Before leading Sterling to a distant post, San made a few touches.
The Sky Blues locked the ball in the net before they could move on.
On Tuesday, the City Battles in Hoffenheim in the Rheine-Necker-Arena in Sünschheim, Germany played the championship group at 12:55 pm.
Charger wants to play: Spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Citizens relieved of the threat of a playoff, there was little reason to force another start.
Schrazer hopes to bounce back Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are playoff implications for the Rockies, who lead the NL West in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close out their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can know what the crowd atmosphere is here in Denver and the other team will probably play at the highest level at any point and I'm facing a lot of challenges this year.
Why don't I want to compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter on Sunday, but they are ready to report Schacher's pitch in such a situation.
The Schnitzer, making their 34th start, shot a bullpen session today and will pitch their usual relaxation on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the president made a grim point about the situation that their Supreme Court has chosen Brett Kavanaugh.
"What we've done is at stake in November
The most important decision of our lives is five weeks away.
He said, 'It's big, big - I'm not fighting but I'm really fighting, so I'm going everywhere for great candidates.
Trump said, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you're seeing it right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the futility, the filthiness.
They don't care how much damage they do, who they have to fight for power and control, so they want to take power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
He says, "The Democrats are on a mission to stop and disrupt the war".
He said, "And in the last four days, you've seen angry and mean and hateful and lying Democrats".
He quoted the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which received a great response from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, he, uh, what's the matter?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for one -- it was actually the worst body language -- I've ever seen.
There is no universal church of Labour.
It is intolerable for those who speak their mind
It was no surprise when the workers of Momentum in my local party criticized me for letting me vote.
Finally, I am the newest in a line of Labour MPs who say we are not welcome to 'Mann Ki Baat'.
My fellow MP, John Ryan, did the same because she was totally anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized by the Censor Motion for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, broadly on issues like this that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
"We want to make the meetings inclusive and productive", the notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, today this is not the sound of many meetings and the promise of "kindness, gentleness" has long been forgotten in politics, in fact when it began.
It has become clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, colleagues I had previously thought of as sharing the same political views, I hope I can take the opposite and take positions I would never agree with - whether it be national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - after criticizing abuse on social media, demanding the election be cancelled, denouncing the politics of the Centre, I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I am suspicious of the professionalism and determination of businessmen who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but never feel shame.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that the level of abuse has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the universal church and every "non-confidence" proposal or change in election rules weakens the party.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years to be quiet, not talk too much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I came into politics to do.
Because I was involved with Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the Thatcher government's ignorance, which had really brought down my large school class, I had asked a local councillor or government minister for better public services for those who needed them most.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be more confused about my policy stance and any disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will harm families, businesses and our services, I am not willing to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But I really have no message for Nottingham Momentum, this is for my constituency, whether Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no disruption or threat of political campaigning will interfere with my work which I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
A.Y.R. 38  17 Melrose: NABAD A.Y.R. Go to the top
Two late attempts may have reduced the final results considerably, but there is no doubt that A.Y.R. should win this spectacularly entertaining tenant of the day's premiership match.
They are now at the top of the list, only one out of ten not.
In the end, it was his better defense, the more he was likely to take his best chances, that led the home team and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be happy.
"We have tested the game so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to A.Y.R., they took better chances than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, substituted by Fraser Climo, put A.Y.R. ahead, however, the yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes was released by the turn-around for the game, Melrose was allowed to provide the score and Jason Baggott made an uncapped try.
Klimot extended the AYR lead with a penalty, first, in the half, he scored and then at the break, he made the only attempt to make AYR 17-5.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson tried, replaced by Bagot, to reduce Levy to five points.
Then Rudh Nath was sidelined for a long time due to a serious injury, which was overcome, and after restarting, A.Y.R. progressed through the efforts of Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Blair McPherson was given a yellow card while serving as A.Y.R. captain, and again Melrose paid an extra man to try his place by not replacing Bruce Colvin at the end of heavy pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Strune Hutchison was given a yellow-card for dealing with Klimmo to get him out of the penalty line, McPherson touched the back of the A.Y.R. Mole.
Klimmo turned, as if he had started again, after Kyle Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong and sent out flanker Gregor Henry for the home side's fifth try.
Still sports stars ready for new career in hotel industry
Still sports star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that she has been nominated as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Humphries.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be at the end of the show and it looks like Kieran is planning for life after Craigellagh.
According to the official records list, he is a director of Adriftmoron Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish source suggested that Kieran was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous food business".
'The sea is ours': Ports-free Bolivia hopes court will open way to Pacific Ocean
Malah patrolled a reigning armored naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings wave an ocean-blue flag.
Maritime destinations from Titicaca to the Amazon were depicted with the slogan: "The sea is officially ours.
It is a duty to get it back".
The memory of a completely portless Bolivia, a bloody 19th century resource dispute from Chile to lost coastlines is still vivid - as the Pacific Ocean once again suffers from a swimming disorder.
Perhaps those expectations are the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of speed, unity and patience, and is looking forward to results with a positive attitude", said Roberto Clagidilla, an ambassador from Bolivia.
With many Bolivians watching the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, it is hoped that the court in The Hague will be in favor of Bolivia's claim as Chile is forced to negotiate free navigation to Bolivia after decades of proper negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Christian indigenous president - who is facing a contentious battle for re-election next year - is also very much in awe of Monday's decision.
She vowed in late August, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands has no UN authority to grant Chilean territory, and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zarate, a Chilean professor of international law, said the final arguments indicated that the case was "not complicated" and that the ICJ decisions come only six months after the case was heard.
And from the Bolivian causes that have been pushed forward, perhaps the last four years have set it back.
"The issue of maritime connectivity has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
He suggested Morales's blunt rhetoric had deprived him of any distinct Chilean reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about some issues for some time, but after that it will be very difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodriguez Valtez, former Bolivian representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was too hasty.
Monday will bring a unique opportunity to open a new era of Bolivia-Chile relations and end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit.
Kalajadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
He said, Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen as long as it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho says he will never destroy his nation's nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Re was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made to opposition leaders during an event in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of resuming more than three months of stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it is a "pipe dream" that the US could defeat the North at any time, perpetually allowing and declaring the end of the Korean War.
Washington is wary of declaring without prior consent of Pyongyang's specific denuclearization moves.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second event.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the asylum seekers, which the country sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to prepare for Pyongyang's second Kim-Trump summit next month.
The Paris Fashion Show will showcase the new line in a large headline on the route of a high street near you.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Sculptors Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled the stunning set at Paris Fashion Week on the stage runway and the oddly large headwear array for their SS19 collection.
This summer, the most unusual hats have been making waves on Instagram and these designers have sent their impressive creations for catwalks.
Valentino was dressed in a distinctive top hat and a wide brim that covered the models' heads.
Other larger-sized items include a watermelon with diamond beads, a unique hat, and a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown reveals a unique mask - just for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lip-synched and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One composition with snorkel and an enca resembled scuba diving gear, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you have made a big fashion statement - you are in luck.
The spectators guess that the giant hat has made its way to the high alleys near you.
The big-sized hats are pulsating on the La Bamba stands, the pipe hat with a two-foot wide rim that is visible to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Razatkowski.
The cult label behind the very impossible hat that went viral on social media made another big creation for catwalks - a beach-like bag with a pipe, the size of a swimsuit, a covered model wearing it.
The orange ribbon bag burned in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 compilation at Paris Fashion Week, decorated with ribbon beads and topped with a white leather handle, was a distinctive garment.
Luke Armitage, who styles the famous artist, told Femala: "I'm hoping to have big hats and beach-like bags on high heels by next summer - as the designer has made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for big things".
John Edward: Language proficiency is essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a track record of academic quality, and this outstanding test results continued in 2018 with another set of results that are only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with over 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of Autonomous Independent Schools is to provide their students with advanced and higher education, to prepare them to choose careers and to prepare them as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages as a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes into his brain.
If you talk to her in her own language, she will go to her mind.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
We can see from the recent test results this year, that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest success rate in autonomous schools.
A total of 68 per cent of the learners had obtained a high grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of learners achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who also achieved A are studying German, 69 per cent are studying French and 63 per cent are learning Spanish.
This is evidence that foreign languages are being supported as a key skill in the Scottish Autonomous Schools, which will undoubtedly be essential for children and young people in the years to come.
Languages as a subject choice are now being taught in autonomous school curriculum as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the Commission for Employment and Skills in the UK in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers struggle to fill jobs are a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more essential to prepare young people for their future professions.
In a globalized world, languages are needed, these skills are needed for more potential job opportunities.
Whether one chooses a profession or not, if they have learned a second language, they will really benefit from such lifelong skills in the future.
A multilingual person will automatically be placed ahead of the competition as he is able to interact directly with people from foreign countries.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of young people were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to continue a conversation and French is the only language spoken by a single language double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is more important to spend money on teaching languages to children today.
Many languages, especially those in developing economies, will prepare children with a better chance of getting meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus more on classical modern languages, while other languages that are to be seen by 2020 will be taught by the UK's most importantly regarded languages, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, Autonomous Schools will always have multiple languages to choose from, including teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Autonomous Schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied at this time that in a global business environment, that language is very important for the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Autonomous schools will continue to provide choice, diversity and skills for Scotland's young people.

LeBron, to start the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Leacher's coach Luca Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But only how many minutes will play is yet to be determined.
The official website Walton on the Lakers said it would be more than one and less than 48.
Laker reporter Mike Trudill tweeted that James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After practicing this weekend, James was asked about his "six-game broadcast schedule plans" for the Lakers.
"I don't need preseason games to get me ready to get to this stage of my career", he said.
Timing of Trump's West Virginia rally, watch on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump's campaign rallies have started a riot in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies for Trump next week, including stops at convenient locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with confirming his petition to fill Supreme Court vacancies, Trump has aimed to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the votes risk losing control of Congress if action is taken in November.
The timing of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 5:00 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 25, 2017.
You can watch the live online broadcast of Trump's Virginia rally at the bottom of YouTube.
This week, Trump is set to address the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwan-hoon, who has been plagued by sexual misconduct allegations, with a Senate confirmation vote projected for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the rally's main purpose is to help the rally gain some momentum against the Republicans in the November election.
Thus, according to Reuters, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives".
A Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters, "Congress's control is too tight to his agenda that the president will travel to the territory as much as possible, we are in a busy campaign season.
For the arrangement in Wheeling for the Wesleyan Arena, "It will bring Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters to the rally tonight and may get Pittsburgh media coverage", according to West Virginia Metro news.
The state where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2017 will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia last Saturday.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morsi, who is falling behind in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president has come to try to boost him in the election", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showing the fight to keep expectations alive as they head into Sunday's singles
After the three-way session, there will be a four-person group on Saturday afternoon for this Ryder Cup.
Swinging forward and backward of speed is a purely sporting concept but one that the player truly believes in, and never more than that.
So they will say where is the momentum now?
Jordan Spieth, walking comfortably for the day, said, "I guess, they had a six-figure lead and now it's four, so we're moving a little bit forward".
Europe has the advantage of being ahead by four points over 12 in the game.
As Speith says, Americans, feel that although they have a bounce in their game and they have a lot to be excited about, are no less form than Speeth and Justin Thomas, who each scored three points out of four and played together all day.
Spieth has impacted from the moon to the Earth and continues to do so, for example.
As his round went on, the screams from his throat grew louder, and he took all four quarters of the match when he and Thomas came down twice after two, a crucial (golf) ball sank.
His golf ball that won him the match on 18 balls was hit with the same screams, as he believes the American team is not out of it.
Spieth said, "You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own match".
Each of these players has now left all this behind.
17 chariots to make a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players in the last two days to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas, the undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples are four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple not to hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they continued to neglect bogeyes on Friday afternoon and the nine-point lead moved back to Friday morning.
The race and the way their energy flows from this evolved enterprising crowd is that they are the losers on Sunday, and no more popular than Fleetwoods or Molinari could have prevented the ambitious European from winning as the sun set over Le Golf National.
Especially when both are on different holes at the same time.
However, the European pride is timeless.
While she was paired with Alex Noreen, Babbitt Watson and Webb Simpson did a bit of Sergio Garcia, the hero of Four Balls of Morning.
A bogey and two doubles for the Spaniard and the Swede dug a hole on Samnon No Dough and they were never close to exiting.
However, on Sunday, there is no one outside your hall to help you.
Four balls and four acquaintances are becoming more attractive to watch because of the impact of the couple's ideas, the advice they gave, the way in which a policy can change instantly.
Europe has played well as a team and then took a solid lead in the first and last day but this four-man session also showed that Team USA, especially the Stateside, was doubting the guts to fight.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 17-0
Europe will take a good advantage of Saturday's four ball and four know-how matches with a 17-7 lead over the USA on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took their four points from Le Golf National with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods.
European side Thomas Bjorn was betting to retain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, beating the American team 3-1 in the morning on four balls.
The USA had a lot of opposition in four games, won two, but they didn't lose.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points to retain the trophy in Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie in Ryder Cup history to score four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational week, were only the second pair to win four of the first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls he defeated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a heated upset, by an even more impressive 8 and 4.
Woods, who had dragged himself into two matches on Saturday, had occasionally sparked talent but now he has lost 17 of 20 games with four balls and four knockouts and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's four ball, returned with teammate Henrik Stenson on Jan. 4, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 to finish first and third in the world.
A pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris on its way, although Europe did not have it.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set a two-point benchmark for the Americans on Saturday.
They won on four balls, 2-1 to Spain's John Rahm and Lan Polter, and then came back to beat Polter and Rory McLaury 4-3 after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-digit deficit going into the singles, although Furyk's team only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After the second best two days, however, a Sunday counterattack would be beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' it will unilaterally drop weapons without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions had deepened its uncertainty in the US and that the country had no way of relinquishing its sole weapons of mass destruction in such a situation.
Ri Ho-yang told the annual General Assembly of the Peoples of the World that last year North Korea took "very compelling goodwill measures", such as a ban on nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of nuclear sites, and a pledge to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "While we do not see any complementary response from the US".
There will be no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States and there is no other way in which we can come together and surrender ourselves without weapons in the first place.
When Ri addressed Washington's opposition to North Korea's known complaints about denuclearization to honor North Korea, which took the necessary steps, his remarks were significant, as Pyongyang has in the past.
On June 12, Ri cites a joint statement issued by Kim Yang-un and Donald Trump, "A retired US president and a North Korean leader arrived in Singapore for the first time at a summit, while Kim vowed to work on a "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security".
North Korea wanted a written end to the 1953 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to calm tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation-first and has agreed to achieve its objective by increasing the level of pressure, and also objected to the declaration of an end to the fighting, said Ri.
"The understanding that the outsiders can beat us is a pipe dream of those who are unaware of us.
But the difficulty is that the continuous restrictions are deepening our distrust".
Ri made no reference to the second summit talks between Kim and Trump, which the US leader held at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: If South Korea had been a party to the issue of denuclearisation and not the US, denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula would not have gone so far.
When she told the United Nations, however, the tone of Ri's speech was very dramatically different from last year. The General Assembly was adamant that "Mr. Evil President" Trump was calling Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission targeting America's special land with a North Korean rocket.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim for his courage to take the unarmed step, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued at the UN that the defense council wanted to step in and honor Pyongyang.
While, US Secretary of State Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be rigorous and without fail until we understand a full, final, certified denuclearisation".
In 2006, the Security Council unanimously lifted sanctions on North Korea in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and gravity-propelled missile programs.
Pompeo met with the UN Branch at Rion-Path at the General Assembly and later said he would travel to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already made three trips to North Korea this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and was denounced for his "ridiculous demands" for North Korea within hours.
North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the US took appropriate action.
He said Kim had told him he was looking forward to steps that mirrored Trump's pledge of a period of security in Singapore and move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
This year a new course at Harvard University has got all its undergraduates to take a leap through a language to counter the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters' to get a good night's sleep.
Students like the Academic Council are often overwhelmed by the number one university in the world when it comes to basic needs like how to take care of themselves.
Charles Szigler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She inspired me to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
'At the end of it, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I being told this now, in my senior year?'
He told the Telegraph, he said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, tells students that good sleep education improves their overall well-being as well as academic and athletic performance.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university made the decision to launch the course after severe sleep deprivation among students during the week.
A series of interactive activities is included in the hour-long course.
On one side is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books where the effects of caffeine and light and the effects on runner performance and the importance of sleep routines are explained.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, trauma and cancer.
Then a campus map, with interactive icon, inspires participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of the student at all.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke", said Professor Sziessler.
Sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students, he said, the culture of 'Stay awake' is still alive.
He said - sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, also ensuring that they also want to stop gaining weight, as sleep keeps the unconscious brain in starvation mode, keeping them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biologist who helped prepare Professor Czeisler's course, was one of his classmates for his first year at Harvard last year.
She said the course has opened her eyes and encouraged her to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next phase, he hopes, all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before joining the competing institution.
Prof. Sziessler suggests that students should set alarms to sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can knock your circadian rhythm out of good shape, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Raiders: Menga goal from Gerrard's man down
The Rangers had another blow of the competition's far-blue day as Dolly Menga's strike destabilised Steven Gerrard for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were trying to record their first win on the road since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side had settled Gerrard's second defeat in just 17 games as Ladbrokes continued to be at the heart of the Premiership leaders with eight points left as manager.
Menga struck seven minutes before half time and the Rangers' lineup never looked to be even.
While Rangers are now down from sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And when an item is thrown away, it can be more of a nuisance for Rangers in the store after lineman Calum Spence's treatment for a head injury.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the Betfred Cup semi-final that knocked Ayr out.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who had taken a point from Hearts last week and would have been delighted when his drilled drug made it difficult to breathe for his opponents each time with his well-dressed manner.
Rangers could have had an effective possession but Livingston overshot the ball, which they had.
He wanted to score in just two minutes when Menga was sent off by Scott Pittman, sent in by first-time Allan McGregor, but the midfielder pushed on his improved opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs got a deep free-kick back to skipper Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only attempt at the back post.
Rangers took over but the final third had more expectations than confidence about their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been fined at the quarter-hour mark because he and Steven Lawless had clashed but referee Steven Thomson overruled the Colombian appeal with a hand gesture.
Rangers scored only two first-half goals but were put into clear trouble on a simple strike from former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly and a title from player Lassana Coulibaly.
Although Livi's 34th minute opener could have been against the game, no one can deny that he was the only one deserving of his graft.
Again the Rangers failed to settle with a deep set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slid the ball to Scott Robinson, who comfortably picked up Menga for a simple elimination.
Gerrard played in midfield as he took revenge from Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch provided almost an instant impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to the block.
However Livingston was playing exactly the same game he enjoys by sweeping the visitors from long to long with Lithgow and Halkett, which kept him making long after long of Lithgow and Hawket.
Holt's team could have pulled out in the final round but McGregor stood up right to deny Jacobs before hitting him with his head from the corner of Lithgow.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim because he was confused with Jacobs but then Thomson looked back at him.
Janatri invented the Geiger Counter
And now a page in our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1723, on this day 130 years ago, and counting... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation, an invention that later became known as the Geiger Counter instrument.
Since a staple of science, the Geiger Counter has also become a staple of pop culture, with the 1970 film "Bells of Coronado", which seems to have been possibly the star of the movie, featuring scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Who in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being emitted by radioactive materials in minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping up now!"
"Hans" was a few days shy of his 30th birthday, Geiger died in 1847.
But the invention that carries his name.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to detect damaged cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill damaged cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as a treatment
The procedure involves removing the patient's immune cells, transferring them to the laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that may be common to many cancers and then inject it again.
An investigational vaccine is showing improved results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells was found to have had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing the immune cell from the patient, switching it to the laboratory so they can see the HER2 protein common in many cancers, and then injecting it again.
"Our results suggest that we have very good vaccines", said Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bel Air, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky explained that "HER2 drives the development of many cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar attempt to extract immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to target cancer cells is underway to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began to denounce a pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL presentation
This was not right.
Kanye West was called into the studio after a spectacular performance during a live on Saturday night in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for governor in 2020.
After her third song performance at night in Ghost Town, in which she wore a hat proclaiming America great, she boasted to reiterate her support for Democrats and Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to a white guy and he says: 'He's racist, how can you like Trip?'
He said, "Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL opened the show with a preview in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocks Brett Kwan-hoon's testimony on sexual assault claims before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Christine Blaise Ford.
Footage of West's bragging was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock, although it was not aired.
If Rock was trying to joke with West's posting, it's not clear.
West had also complained to the audience that he had faced a troublesome clock behind the stage over the head covering.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
He said, 'You must not go out there wearing a hat.'
They Bothered Me!
According to the Washington investigator, he said, and then he said, "I'm in the wrong place",
West added: "Do you want to see the missing spot?" saying that he would "put on my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love".
His comments led to at least two cheers from viewers and embarrassed select members of SNL, with one person Variety reported telling the publication: "The whole studio went into a fit of panic".
West was brought in to replace the late singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had just completed a few days ago.
West surprised many people with his performance of the song I Love You, dressed like Pierre Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Tyner who tweeted: "The bravest spirit: Thank you for standing in front of the crowd".
But talk show host Kieran Hunter tweeted that West Bus "is what it is and it's completely unhealthy".
Which I believe is embracing and embracing an ideology that is harmful to my society, "but I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or helping their "art").
He is free.
He said, "We are the same".
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name before the show, saying he was now known as "Kenya West".
Changing his name, he is not the first artist to do so and follows in the footsteps of DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy Daddy and PDD.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg is named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and the uddo artist was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of premeditated murder with a knife in Belfast restaurant
A 46-year-old man was charged with murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been criticized for his massive masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the sword-wielding role of Jon Snow for the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Naik, 31, has influenced the Macho Naik narrative, saying that on screen such roles have meaning for boys who often feel they need to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something has gone wrong' and how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 13, admitted that he feels "very reluctant" about addressing the issue.
He said, 'At this point, I feel quite personally, - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?'
'In view of the problems we face now, what are we teaching men when they grow up?'
Kit believes that television can be held partly responsible for the rise in mass masculinity thanks to its large male characters.
He continued: 'What is the birthright and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, that makes young boys feel like they have these few aspects as a man?
How can we change this? I think that's really one of the big questions of our time.
Because some of the youngsters have clearly done something wrong.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not be making a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones at the end of next summer because he is 'fed up with battlefields and horses'.
Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West revival from November which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a bandit.
Recently, Naik has revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best way to get out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, and thus it gave me my future family and my life grew there.'
Rose Ygritte played the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2017 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has recorded a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 82,500 people are affected in the country.
Around 49,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2017 alone.
There is a change from the past in how the large number of cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
Traditionally, as a result of infected blood transfusions, HIV is spreading rapidly in parts of China.
Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province, but the number of people living with HIV was thus reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 17,000 people year on year.
A serious issue in China's LGBT community is the transmission of HIV through sexual contact.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1990, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted by unprotected sexual intercourse that comes from these relationships.
Since 2013, the Chinese government has pledged to make efforts to address the issue as part of a broader approach to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that staff members said GOP senators leaked data, blasted 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
USA Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were being driven by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies and other reprehensible lies".
Information released by home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. includes: S. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Utah, both Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
Information posted online by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill was seen on Thursday during a Senate panel hearing regarding sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The secret of this information was revealed shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
According to information from Capitol Hill, traditional sites like Gateway Experts and Red State reported that the IP addresses that identify the source of the posts were associated with the Waters office and a member of Waters' staff has also been notified.
Waters added, "This baseless accusation is completely false and a blatant lie".
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a blatant lie.
Waters' statement prompted criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fletcher wrote, "This denial is infuriating".
"This shows that he does not have the character to be a Congress member.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
They should not feel guilty.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They should be calm and steadfast".
Fletcher was seen comparing the criticism by Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh to the reaction of Waters, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also took to Twitter to voice his opinion on removing Waters from the midterm elections.
"Big if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he added, "and they will be held legally accountable for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any of my employees and all employees".
Johnny English reviews - Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof was underrated.
It has become traditional to see Brexit importance in any new film with a British film and this applies to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Known English Reborn.
Will we be openly bullshitting on a subject that is a new export opportunity for the country?
At any cost, Pop-Ide, the unassuming Johnny English has a license to start over again - as their names imply, they are a wide-ranging comic creation designed for non-English-language cinemas.
He is definitely a draft secret agent who despite his apparent disguise for smooth glamour got a little clownish, a dash of Mr. Bean and a face contributing to a note for the Fire Thunid chariots at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is basically based on the mystery of the traveller and international figure that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclays TV commercials, leaving him in a mess.
There are also one or two good moments in this latest JE outing.
I liked Johnny English coming up to a helicopter, when he was wearing a coat mid-calf suit and the rotary blades were spinning against his helmet.
Atkinson's skill for physical comedy is on display, but humor is rare and strangely over-the-top, especially as "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently present themselves as a component.
Laughter makes it feel as if it's pitched at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's weird exercises are not unconvincing and Bean's personality is centered on Atkinson's silent-movie gags.
The long-standing situation is that Great Britain is in a serious crisis.
A cyber-hacker has penetrated the super-secret web network of Britain's spies, revealing the identities of all the UK agents in the field, leaving behind the agent on duty - an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Alden.
This is the final nail in the coffin for a Prime Minister, a pompous and front-runner who is already completely broken by political hypocrisy: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May character but there is not much to work with the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that as every active spy has compromised, he would have to bring someone out with a service retirement.
And that means fighting Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh prestige, but giving off-the-record lessons on becoming an undercover operative: There are some good gigs, like the English School of Rock-type spy academy.
English was sent back to the White House for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering sidekick Bowe, once again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bo is a married man, obsessed with a submarine commander, a net-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Pepperdine has been a bit wasted.
Thus Batman and Robin face being badly mistaken for the Secret Service of His Majesty, Olga Kryulenko meets the beautiful and attractive woman Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the mantra of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bowe embark on their ridiculous high-zinc odyssey: disguised as a waiter, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they smuggle on board Volta's yacht; and English operates the Pure Disorder as he tries to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
All stops are definitely taken out of that final sequence, but as it is capable and adaptable, there is plenty on children's TV about the whole thing.
Beautifully modified goods.
And with other Johnny English films I can't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that actually does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it is planning a four-day workweek for people in Britain but that five days are to be paid.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would see Britons working in a four-day week - but being paid for five.
The party wants the company to pass on savings to the employees by giving them an extra day off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This will allow the employees to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same salary.
The sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and would give the country a working class edge.
The four-day week is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economic situation, as confirmed by the Trades Union Congress.
A senior Labour Party leader told the Sunday Times: 'The policy analyst is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but the four days work is the inspiration of a week which fits in with the whole industrial strategy of the party as well as the party vision to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to confirm such an idea, the Green Party organised a four-day work week during their 2017 party's general election campaign.
The will is not currently being fully confirmed by the Labour Party, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDaniel used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDaniel said he was determined to take power back from the "uncharacteristic directors" and "profiteers" of Utility France.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in sunk companies cannot recover their full stake as the Labour government could 'reduction' on the basis of known wrongdoing.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to place employees on company boards and to hand over 10 per cent of the amount (equity) to private sector firms for employees, who can take up to £500 annually.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy in 60 Minutes, explains whether the FBI's Kwan Hoon investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kwanhoe has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and questions have been raised about whether the bureau's findings should be endorsed by any Republican senators.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would prompt them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more prominent than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kwanhao.
I called him after it happened, the accusation came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was stable, determined, without a doubt".
Graham's vote, however, seems to be irrevocable.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kwanhoe and it will be a dynamite accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people were not able to bear his name.
He is 36 years old.
I am not seeing any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a spectacularly impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the programme's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival which started in 2012 is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you (VIP) were willing to pay for a ticket), musicians had to complete a number of tasks, or tasks, such as emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or adopting any other meaningful means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a genuine way to motivate people to act, or is it just a matter of collectivism - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters urging for the hosting of different causes.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, set to impact the lives of more than $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations stemming from its work, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, "committed to helping children grow to their full potential", which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments, and global citizens, we can reduce social injustice like you from a foot-note in history, Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ulla told the crowd during a live music event in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts to improve nutrition for mothers and babies in Britain, the government announced funding for a single scheme, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and babies with nutrition intervention.
In response to the question posed on this website, what do you think about "Can we end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the exhibitors at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furniss and Hugh Jackman.
US may use naval blockade to "obstruct" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington Investigator, Washington could use its waters to prevent Russian forces from entering the market, including the Middle East, if "necessary", US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinke alleged that Russia's actions in Syria - particularly where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - are a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that energy brokers want to do the same as they do in Eastern Europe, south of Europe", he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, together with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He will compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is to replace and replace fuel, more or less", he said, referring to Russia's one-way trade with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "hell" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a material to exercise pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Hungjo Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading organization for German industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has announced that the US is withdrawing from the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when there is a third state interference in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will keep a close eye on the ongoing presidential race in 2020, says Massachusetts senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would closely monitor the presidential race in view of the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman above all else", she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will closely monitor the election of the President".
Warren told President Donald Trump during the town hall that he was "taking the county in the wrong direction by saying this.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren spoke out in criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanhoe.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
In a poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren's constituency voters indicated they do not think she will run in 2020.
Eighty-fifths of Massachusetts "probable" voters say the senator should not be following the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Twenty-two (32%) responded to this approach.
The survey showed more support for such a system by former Governor Deval Pattik, with 38 percent supporting the proposed system and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed regarding the 2020 possibility include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin made a statement at the PTSD Donald Trump rally of Track Palin.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
On Monday night, he was arrested and fined in a domestic violence incident.
"I can relate to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers bring back with them", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bad situation" and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back with determination, they think if this is the respect for them that this is the respect that their other soldiers and airmen (air force) and every member of the army have given to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with assaulting a woman in domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 States challenge support of DC for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims escaping a group or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District knocked on the door of the Friends of the Court in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the person who filed the case in court is also Grace. The Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy does not appear to be true.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused him but U.S. authorities denied his request for asylum until July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorney Grace of the States supported the case of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generates a large number of applicants for asylum in the US, as the international states face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Carl Racín said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend of the Court summarized, "Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the specific facts of the claim, and the facts and circumstances and such bar violates this principle".
Attorneys briefly argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry is hurting the American economy by saying they are more likely to do "due diligence" and become entrepreneurs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to allow victims of domestic abuse and gang violence to seek asylum in June.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their native country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The desperate rescue efforts in Palu double the number of deaths in the race to find the living.
The conditions were terrible for survival.
"It feels very stressful", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-stricken child at an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"An ambulance brings bodies every minute.
Clean water is very scarce.
Residents were seen coming to their destroyed houses, picking up water-damaged items, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were seriously injured and taken to hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, they were buried under water.
Some of the wounded, including Dwy Harris who suffered from broken back and shoulder, were placed outside the army hospital in Palu where patients were being treated outside after continuous concussions.
Tears came to his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, as he told his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to defend myself.
I was put in the rubble of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in a town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to me and her child.
I hope they are safe.
US Ambassador accused China of bullying advertising.
An official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the US a week after a daily US-China sales trade reciprocal benefits, accusing the US ambassador to China of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump cited a pay supplement from China Daily in the Des Moines Register on Wednesday - Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - accusing it of trying to meddle in China's November 6th U.S.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election, while US officials told Reuters, was a major campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them raise the level of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, China counter-tariffed states (US states) that were prepared to dump exporters like Lowa who backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Bernstad and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brunswick wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Des Mains Register, "is now doubling down on bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using itself to America's tradition of free speech and a free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Bernstedt wrote.
In contrast, here at Newsstand Down Street in Beijing, you will find limited uncooperative voices and not see any true echo of various opinions that Chinese people can think of China's troubled economic trend, stating that the Chinese media is entirely under the Communist Party", he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most famous newspapers cleverly declined the offer to publish" in his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans already segregate female voters with Kwanhao, analysts warn.
Many top Republicans have backed and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanhoe in the wake of multiple allegations of physical assault, with analysts warning that they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming, midterm elections.
Sentiments around it have become very high, and most Republicans are already showing they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things cannot be put behind us", Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill newspaper in an article on Saturday.
Rehr said he doubts that the last-minute action taken by Senator Jeff Fluke (R-Ariz.) to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm angry voters.
Women are not forgetting what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not even in November", said Karin Jean-Perre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group Movon, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters said "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallway that the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Kwanhoe despite testimony from Dr. Kurstin Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to top the charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying that it is already high, it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among swing women (who can vote for any candidate) in the voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote when they don't like the president".
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that a setback could arise if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a complicated mess for GOP", said Michael Staley, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether KwanHo sits on the bench (as a Supreme Court justice), it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated him", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities America, a group that helps Democrats get elected, pointed out to the news channel.
Yet Americans are somewhat divided who believe Ford and Kwanhoe's testimony afterwards, siding with the latter a little more.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Quano was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flack's indictment, the FBI is currently investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kwanhoe had assaulted her while drinking when she was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court representative exposed his genitals to him when he attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Searchers for the World Wide Web, a new Internet, are making plans to take over from Google and Facebook.
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a startup that is seen as opposing Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt is a company that solidifies Burns-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "rule the world".
We have to do this now, he has asked us to start it.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to "store their personal data online" or create a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
These are all available on the same browser like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify and all at the same time.
What is unique about storing personal data online is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls it "Personal Empowerment through Data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources to the company, process and help make the right skills available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce's, a security platform that has been purchased by IBM, some staff who have agreed to work on the developer's project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Inraput website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team are not talking to "Facebook and Google" about whether they might be in a position to introduce a complete transition, where all their business models have fully grown overnight.
"We are not asking for their guidance".
In a post on the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the goal of Inertip is "to provide commercial energy and a natural system to protect the integrity (solidarity) and a quality to build the web on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next round of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric was celebrated
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I is celebrated as a fighting warrior in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack on Bellanglais and Lehocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled (covered) by his grandchildren at a parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughn, said it was a "great sign", the stone would appear almost 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal "in very dense fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and with "great bravery" led the line and defeated (conquered) three different units before being shot with one hand by a field-gun.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never accomplish but something that is diminishing in importance".
He and his brother Dr James Vaughan laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "feeling very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero was shown by the support that is being given by so many".
MMA supporters stayed up all night to see Ballot 206 instead of seeing Pappagallo (a British cartoon serial).
Imagine, you have stayed all night to see a ballot 206 pack and you have been denied the main agenda.
Bill from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main card and was shown in the UK by Channel 5 at night.
At 6am as Gejard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were unexpectedly surprised when coverage was changed to Papa Pig.
Some were very unprepared for battle, especially after staying awake until the early hours.
A supporter on Twitter described the transformation of the children's cartoon as "some kind of low-level joke".
"It's government policy that by 6am this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programmes", said Belater's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes" Papa Pig is a good example.
Scott Cocker, President of Ballet Company, said that they are going to work on their schedule to engage the UK audience in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can maybe work on it", Coker said.
"But we will not be able to complete the work there on Sunday at 6 am and by our time on Sunday, Monday at their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when that changed, many of the writings were outdated and they weren't all as friendship-oriented.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical fault.
But it was not like that, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that next time it will not be like this.
We'll put it down to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we tried to give the fans more than we could handle and we just observed it.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'low' on his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling disgusted by everyone because of his sexuality.
The 24-year-old says he didn't experience "everyone is not like me" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lorraine Labrinth, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a father makes him even more careless to win the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Christy Young, has been on hiatus for several months due to illness.
Appearing on the first episode of Labyrinth and a preview of Castaway (an American drama film), Daley said that she felt "less (less) than anyone" who is getting older (at age) because "it's not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
She said: "To this day, their feelings of being undervalued, and feeling isolated are their real feelings that have given me the strength and strength to succeed (Bull).
He wanted to prove that he was "something", she said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when he suddenly found out about his gender.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and made his presence felt at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to other countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live freely without any opposition and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "just shocked me".
Dale dated the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but said there was no issue of age difference.
"When you go through something so young" - he first went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's very difficult to find someone at your age who has experienced good and bad on an equal basis.
The couple became parents to a son in June, named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Dale said his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I should have won the gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are bigger things here than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robby.
Her son's name is the same as that of her father Roberts, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 while undergoing a diagnosis of brain cancer.
She said her father didn't accept that she was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if she had tickets to go to London 2012 - so she could sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him (my father) 'Dad, you're not even going to sit around the front row,'" she said.
"I grabbed his (my father's) hand and he had stopped breathing. And it wasn't until he stopped breathing and he was dead, that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Dale competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that there was no better experience than what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games", she said.
She inspired a love of her first song - Pride by Heather Small - which had been hated along with her in the build-up to the Olympics and has so far made her a roaring star.
He will appear on the Desert Island Disc on Sunday at 11:15pm (BST) on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson, who was performing poorly, was ruled out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match but he will have to come in at his best to avoid this unfortunate milestone.
Michaelson was ruled out of the two-year competition for a record 12th time by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday morning and afternoon (balls played in the Ryder Cup).
Rather than being in the middle of the action, as he often does for the U.S., the five-time major champion split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game range to improve the boundaries of the game that he finds offensive.
Never able to play the most straightforward of players at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old's tight golf is not an ideal yoga for the National Course, where long rope rounds regularly hit shots.
And if its own courses aren't difficult enough, on Sunday in Game 9, Michelson faces the right-handed British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans are four points short of the start of 12 singles matches, don't play too fast, Michelson's match could be completely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his husband, except that he could not say much.
"What he did today was he fully understood his role, he gave me a pat and put his hand around my ((shoulder) and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furik said.
"He gained a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to these teams this week, and this week.
I might have considered that he is playing two matches.
I thought further, but this is the way it worked and so we thought this is the way we have to go.
He wants to go there like everyone else".
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could have signaled the end of a Ryder Cup career that did not quite match the height of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence would bring some strength and confidence to the team.
"He's funny, he's goofy, funny, likes to get rough on people. And he's a good guy to be in the team room", she said.
"I think the younger players should have gone to him in terms of humor, as well as this week, to see humor.
He gives more than just playing".
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjorn knows that Big Lead (an American blog newspaper) could disappear soon.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from his experience that a measured lead in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unsafe journey in the final day's singles.
Dane played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by the Sea Ballasters took a five-point advantage over the Americans but finished the finish line winning just 14 points to 13 points, with very few fences to their nose.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a huge lead at Valderrama; our huge lead at Brooklyn, where we lost and Valderrama where we won, but only Bjorn said Friday and looking at yesterday's 2018 5-3 winning teams, Lee took a 10-6 lead over the team at Golf Comi.
So history will tell me and everyone is on his team that it is not over.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the good.
It is not over until you get marks on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus is.
I have said everything in summary, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Very happy with how his players performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn said: "I would never go ahead with this before.
Tomorrow is a dangerous beast.
The coming tomorrow is individual performances that come forward, and that's a different thing to do.
It is good to go there with your partner, when the good work is going on, when you are there in a meaningful way, then you are tested to the best of your ability as a golfer.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players, they will get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he should go and get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, the number opposite Jim Furyk sees his players individually outperforming their peers, except for Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big endings, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before becoming a loser as Europe performed the "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every bad word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, prevented his players from joining the race on the final day.
"We have 12 matches (against) tomorrow but you have to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in between.
We got our line fully ready and put the boys in fashion that we liked, you know, tomorrow we are doing something amazing".
Thomas is tasked with leading the biggest match ever and facing Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tony Fleetwood and Ian Polter in the first half to take the lead.
"I went with the guys from this group in this order because I think it will be completely covered (ho)", Bjorn said in his singles selections.
Germany's new warship was once again postponed
The German Navy's newest frigate was authorized to operate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era Workship. But this could not happen the following year due to poor systems and low cost, local media reported.
The authorization of the lead ship "Rhineland-Palatinate" of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel is due to join the Navy in 2014, but a troubling post-delivery issue has jeopardised the future of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will replace the obsolete Berman-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is understood to be a powerful cannon, capable of firing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as radar reduction, infrared and fast signals.
Other important features are that it will not have to be repaired for a long time and it should be possible to implement it when new frigates are isolated from their ports for about two years.
However, the continued delays meant that the warships were endangering Germany's ability to allow power projects abroad - already obsolete by the time the service starts, Die Zeit wrote in the note.
The ill-fated F-120 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to pay for the aircraft and returned it to Lom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little information was available about the reasons for the return of the aircraft, but according to German media, the warship was not fit for any combat due to "software and hardware failures".
The software flaws were more significant as the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120, half the number of the old Bremen class.
It was also found that the weight of the ship was too much which reduced its capability and prevented the Nine from putting new items in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is considered a twin brother to the 
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of crew training, was also an issue.
It is said that the cost - from the initial €2.2 billion - had reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
Recent warnings of the declining power of the German Navy make the problem of not being able to keep up with new warships significant.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the nine armies actually had a "deployable aircraft shortage".
The official said that the issue became bigger and more important over time, as the old aircraft were deemed unfit and removed but no other aircraft were brought in to replace them.
He regretted that no Baden-Württemberg class warship could join the Navy.
The National Trust keeps a close eye on the private lives of bats
A new study in a region of the Scottish Highlands reveals how bats use landscapes to find food
It is hoped that this research will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying animal and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will include common, saprano pipistral, brown long-eared and Dobbonton bat found in Inverve Gardens in Wester Rose.
Recorders will be installed at selected locations to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and helpers will also conduct small surveys with handheld detectors.
Special analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of the bats' sound and also find out which species is doing what.
A practical map and a report will be presented, based on which a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour will be created.
NTS nature conservation advisor, Rob Dewar, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help in improving habitat management activities such as grassland creation and forest conservation for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the UK, bat populations have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind and thunderstorms, chemical treatment of fly paper and building materials, and attacks by pet cats can also pose a threat.
Bats are not actually blind
However, due to their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes for catching prey.
They use a state-of-the-art echo-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very critical for bats.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly perform surveys, investigations and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only reserve at the unique Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway dedicated to bats and home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that this is an ideal area for them to live in.
"Here in Thrive Viewe we have a very good place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, old trees and good places to live.
But there is still so much that is unknown about bats, so the work done here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to survive".
He stresses the importance of testing for bats before cleaning these properties etc. because any fatal disaster of childbirth could kill up to 450 women and young girls, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
It is illegal to protect bats, kill them, disturb them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, encouraged people to help out
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects rape claims and lawyers are ready to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismisses rape claims against him as "fake news" and says people use his name to "make themselves famous"
His lawyers are prepared to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, in which the claims were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Meorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009
According to a report by Der Spiegel, he is accused of paying the woman $30,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Hours after the report's claims, in an Instagram live video, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news", telling his 142 million followers:
I'm not going to say no.
What he said today, fake news, "Five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera
Using my name, they just want to broadcast themselves.
It's common to have
They want to be famous with my name, it's part of the job.
The player smiled and added, "I am a happy man and everything is fine".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, for what they call "unacceptable reporting based on doubts in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schurtz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage, equal to the gravity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2007 in a suite overlooking the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in the Nevada exclusive Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Meiruga returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where the player raped Meiruga.
Meorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" but "one percent lost to the rumor".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had intercourse, but that the intercourse was consensual.
Meorga claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken in hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared "revenge" and "social humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now trying to cancel the agreement as she is very mentally disturbed by the incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and joined Italian giants Juventus in a $17 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will always regret 'losing car makers'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if the UK loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, "the UK will regret it forever".
He added that it was noteworthy that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
Japanese car makers say a border delay caused by a no-deal Brexit could have a negative impact on jobs
The Bernaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avenices - produced around 17,000 vehicles last year, of which around 70% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota, in Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover also expressed fears of not reaching an agreement on border trade with the EU.
BMW, for example, said it would close its small Oxford plant for a month after Brexit.
In a no-deal Brexit, the main concern for car manufacturers is supply chain related risks.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming in every 37 minutes to build the vehicles ordered from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 20 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, leading to delays in the arrival of materials and shortages of materials, according to the industry.
Toyota said it may be impossible to keep more than a day's worth of stock at its Derbyshire plant, and so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's draft plan for future relations with the EU is well aligned to prevent border checks.
"We need to make a deal because we want the best deal, which will not only give us the pleasure of succeeding, but the opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have concluded that we need to keep the supply chain that has been so successful running smoothly".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be shut down, but looking at the long term, it was warned that rising costs would reduce plant revenues and ultimately reduce employment.
Peter Sovaleris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and who is the convener of the plant's union, said that their members are also concerned about the situation. "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back", he said.
An official spokesperson said: "We must present a definite and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed indefinitely.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be delayed by another week" because of the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kahne.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the investigation into Russian election interference and the links between Trump's associates and possible obstruction of justice by Russia and the president.
It has been a topic of speculation in Washington for months whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, a New York Times report said that Rosenstein used a wire to record a conversation with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president by the 20th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report
But last Monday he went to the White House and during these reports he was about to resign.
But instead, the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and meeting was delayed further to avoid a confrontation, with testimony from Kavanaugh and a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, at the committee hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh and again delayed a full Senate vote on whether to approve the bill.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set yet for this meeting, maybe this week, I can see that due to the other things going on in the Supreme Court this meeting may be pushed back for another week".
But we will consider it and I always like to give the press the latest news.
Some journalists go against this claim: Sanders has not held a single White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wells asked why.
Sanders said the reason behind the low press conferences was not to dislike the TV reporter, "just that", though she added: "I can't deny the fact that they are very upper-class".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
He said that "the President has more Q&A sessions than any other President", without presenting any evidence, he added: "We have seen the numbers.
"But if the press gets a chance to ask the president questions directly, it's much better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We try very hard to do that, and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, and there will be a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with great people.
Press conferences alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, in front of journalists, a free and sometimes bizarre way of presenting oneself is necessary.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
Health Secretary writes to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the country and expresses their desire to stay on post-Brexit
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter when the UK had less than six months to leave the EU
The Scottish Government had already agreed to bear the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens who were working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, with talks on withdrawals in the UK and EU continuing, the likelihood of a decision moving towards the autumn is increasing.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very anxious time for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate that I fully appreciate the ability of every member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Mike Ogg of Tennessee reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the 31-0 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had already started shortly before halftime.
"He came to the side line and just kind of collapsed", Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the side line before putting him on the stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Vanderbilt Medical Center was out of surgery for Abercrombie's disease.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/depth of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury was sustained.
Abercrombie, a red-shirted, second-year high school kid, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of 18 tackles before he was out of the game on Saturday, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on purchases of property in the UK and the increased amount will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
This move will undermine the success of Corbyn's strategy to attract young voters.
Stamp duty increases will be imposed on people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it can raise up to £12 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty on purchases of property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people in the UK.
The move would undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's ploy to attract young voters and provide affordable housing to the poor while targeting the rich.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK and with the extra money the government will fight the harassment of people who sleep without a home.
Surcharge - which is to be paid apart from the existing stamp duty, which was increased on other houses and buyers and renters two years ago, may be further increased to three percent
The Treasury hopes it can raise up to £12 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly built buildings are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it even harder for first-time home buyers to get their foot on the ladder.
Many affluent parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as many foreign customers spend their time outside the country.
To allow young people to buy their first home more easily, the stamp duty for young people was reduced by Boris Johnson and only a few weeks later the new policy came into force.
She accused big construction firms of keeping land prices high by not buying land and urged Mrs May to remove quotas from affordable housing to stop Britain's "humiliation of housing".
Mr. Corbyn introduced eye-catching reforms that ended rent control and "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give more powers to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British Dream - a better life for every new generation.
And that means we are fixing our collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and spend their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals or foreign companies who do not live in the UK can buy a home here as easily as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of buying a house has become a long way away and sleeping poorly without a home has become a reality for them.
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final dream" is to become Scotland manager after reaching a stage
Scott, 42, is working on the challenge of reviving the North Eastern club, who are now third in the league, three points behind the first-place team.
After leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was the end of it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Voice.
"But I grew up with my father, in Hampden, looking at Scotland, and that was something that always pulled me back.
However, this opportunity can only come if I manage the club successfully.
Ross' ancestors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo de Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss said that after being banned from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, he felt no nerves about such established names at such a big club.
"At this point, the prediction of success for me will be 'Can I get this club back in the Premier League?'"
He said, "Given the structure and facilities of this club it should be in the Premier League without a doubt".
It is not an easy task to get the club back there, but I will probably consider myself successful here only if I can get this club back there".
After 15 months of coaching staff practice at Dumbarton and assistant boss at Hearts, Ross has only had a three-year management career.
He then saved Alloa from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren to win the championship title that season.
And Ross said he now feels much more comfortable playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy than he did during his playing career.
He referred to Aloha's taking responsibility, saying "It is possible that this was a real crossroads".
I really believed that more than playing, management was right for me.
It may sound strange because I recovered, lived a meaningful life, and even enjoyed some high levels of happiness.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis
I still go through stress and job pressures but still manage well.
I've always wanted to organize and now that I'm doing it, I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life now, as if I'm in my own skin right now.

The summer heat has increased efficiency for Britain's struggling pubs but put increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and liquor contract groups rose 2.7 percent in July - but in restaurants fell from 4.8 percent in July.
Business consultant, CAGA's Peter Martin, who compiled the figures, said: "Due to the continuing sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup, July was also similar to June last month, with contracts up 2.8 per cent but the restaurant situation was more difficult.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant turnover in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol were much more popular than restaurants and the condition of the restaurant was just as bad.
Pubs serving food also burned in the sunlight but not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
For this month, liquor sales in managed pubs and condominiums increased by 0.7 percent but food sales declined by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RMS of Leisure and Hospitality Experts said: "These results have been seen since the end of April which are still ongoing.
Weather and major social or sporting events have a greater impact on the market's out-of-home sales.
It is no surprise that the restaurant group's struggle will continue to grow as sales continue to fall by 4.8 percent year on year and other costs add to the pain.
This long summer has brought a bad time for food based operators and time will tell whether this much needed relief in the moderate temperatures we have seen in August will provide them with any relief".
Total sales in July this year, including newly opened pubs and restaurants, rose 2.7 per cent, indicating work was slowing for Brenda.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
A survey shows that, among children as young as 11, one in five have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 2,200 secondary school children showed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
Among children as young as 11, one in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from adults.
A survey of 2,800 secondary school children shows an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - in the context of photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on social media.
20 percent of students say they use a clean "main" account to show their parents, and they also have a personal account.
A mother who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret site noticed that a teenager was saying to others on the site "rape me"
Research in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which had personal accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's very disturbing that so many young people are creating online places for themselves where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elle Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elle Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body at the Board of Scottish Athletics
Doyle is Scotland's most highly regarded track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty called it a great move, saying it was a great opportunity for those who can benefit from Doyle's vast experience at international level.
"Ella is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are confident that her inclusion will greatly benefit athletics in Scotland", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to serve as a voice for athletes and I hope I can lead the sport in Scotland and help take it forward.
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 20m and 40m at the 2016 Games in Atlanta, was temporarily unable to walk due to an ischemic attack and is now a BCC expert.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk
The doctors said that if I recovered or not and if I did, how much I recovered, only time can tell.
It was a terrible job but now I am completely healthy, I learned to walk from scratch and today I am drilling!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement that compares breast milk to cow's milk, divides online opinion
A breast pump company has exchanged views online with an ad that compares nursing mothers and cow's milk.
To mark the launch of "the world's first silent pump to be worn on the chest", consumer technology company LV created a talk-in-tongue music video and released an advertisement, offering mothers the freedom to use it.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's hayloft to a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you won't see any tails" and "If you can't see that these are not thins but my mommies"
The song continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding my women"
However, the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it shows a "terrible" light on the dairy industry.
"The decision to use cows in advertisements for this product is very wrong.
One wrote, "They have to be pregnant to give birth like us, but their babies are stolen within days of giving birth".
LV breast pump fits properly inside the nursing bra (LV/Mother)
Another commented: "It is a stressful time for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to raise their babies?
Another added: "Such incomprehensible advertising is ridiculous".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting she found the song "delightful".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would definitely take a pill.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow
This ad is a little crazy, but I took it because it's cool.
One wrote, "This is a brilliant product.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like "getting wet".
This ad is not praising or criticizing the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with pumps attached to their bras.
The campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the pump feel like cows.
The LV pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes on it and fits comfortably inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and go outside anywhere while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, M.D. and ECD, commented: The LV pump is a revolutionary product that deserved such a bold and bold start.
By drawing parallels in women and dairy cows, we wanted to express it in an entertaining and complete way, keeping in mind all the challenges associated with the breast pump, in which we also showed the wonderful sense of freedom that the pump gives.
This is not the first time that LV Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of a two-year-old child using the product, for designer Marta Jakubowski, was seen walking the cat.
Hundreds of migrant children peacefully moved to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children arrested has increased. Although the monthly number of children crossing the border has temporarily held steady, the harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to give the children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have also come in undocumented, and are afraid that claiming any child they have will jeopardize their ability to stay in their country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that the prospective sponsor and other members of his family would have to present fingerprints and that this information would also be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor minors.
The agency later confirmed that the first 60 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 60 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of the sponsors are living here illegally, and many of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue those individuals", said Mr. Albanes.
According to refugee workers, to speed up the process, the authorities introduced new rules that require children to appear in court not within 7 days of being detained but within 1 month.
Many people will present their case to an immigration judge for legal status, rather than meeting in person, via video conference call.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be immediately removed from the country.
According to reports from refugee workers and recent months of exit from the system, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, leading to violent outbursts or attempts to escape by hiding.
Lawyers say such concerns can arise in a large space like Tornillo, where the signs of childhood struggle are more likely to be overlooked because of its large size.
He added that by not giving children enough time to get emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to friends, sending them to a tent city can leave them with a shock they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Malam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was now in its eighth year.
Malam, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, were illegally on Syrian soil, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Malem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 33,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would "continue to fight this holy war until we clear both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence" from all over Syria.
There are some 200,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish army and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
The war-torn country has more than 180 French soldiers on its soil.
On the issue of refugees, Maulm said conditions were good for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unusual fear" to encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The US and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey provides an opportunity to move forward with political talks with the establishment of a blank zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold.
This Russian-Turkish deal helped prevent a massive attack by the Russian military on the province of 30 million people, which was aided by Syria.
Malem stressed that the agreement had a "clear time limit" and expressed hope that the military operation would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes the first meeting of government and opposition members will soon be convened to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Malam laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's task would only be to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any further interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2002, unless, as many liberal observers are probably expecting, his criticism and any scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a president"!
At present, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime time numbers have doubled to over 17.7 million on CNN and nearly tripled to over 18 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average prime-time audience of 24 million, up from 17 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Meadows Show" has the highest ratings in cable with 35 million viewers on news nights.
Neil Baer, who runs the ABC drama, "Designed Survivor", a drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol collapses, said, "It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand".

She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2017 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
Miss Scovell told me that she said, "He makes me laugh".
In this turmoil, recreation is important
Of course, unlike some other TV shows, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could be reunited and what would happen to the global economy.
A treat is being created that will be enjoyed only by the most qualified audience.
And yet, when you watch a panel of experts fight for six hours over the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", Paul Manfort's $19.99 lobster-skin bomber jacket (a thick cloth, the Washington Post said), and Stormy Daniel's impact on Mr. Trump's physical analysis, you find yourself receiving more information than a citizen.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheel House Entertainment and creator of "Pon Stars", said of Trump's changing cast and daily cast changes (choosing to fight the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un) that "everything he's doing feels like a real play because he's giving you something to watch every night".
You can't leave out a single context or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Flies's this week, it was a 0°C sunny day outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was busy watching MSNBC recording CNN.
When Brett Kavanaugh appeared to face the Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, he couldn't help but be distracted.
Mr. Flea told me, "I remember when we were doing the crazy plays all day long people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
I thought it was a joke, but it actually turned out to be true.

Foreign money floods the very difficult middle class election race.
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania is seeing a flood of money in the 2016 election, once again due to two candidates running for the same seat in two congressional districts.
The recently re-established suburban Pittsburgh district has been targeting Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican incumbent Keith Rothfuss, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is heavily blended with the new 17th district.
The maps were recreated, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally assigned in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th running started a campaign finance competition between the main party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
After a very close victory in the highly-watched, special election for Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district in March, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, that seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 27 points.
Political experts took a slightly more liberal side of the Democrats.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for helping China but then backed down
The ambassadors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama, with little help from Washington, had already recognized Beijing's position.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team was expelled by close partners.
Earlier this month, Heather North said in a statement that State Department officials had decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "new decisions to recognize Taiwan".
But the fine was only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $145 million in US aid for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fine, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings escalated, officials in North America and Central America delayed action at a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity so they could focus on a similar gathering last year to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that the conference should proceed and that any considerations on El Salvador's sanctions, if any, should be completely eliminated.
Based on indications of the import of administration places in the collection, Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference scheduled for mid-October, the diplomats said.
And without any new strong message or punishment from Washington, all three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
For Mr. Bolton, White House spokesmen declined to give details of the debate between three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, on condition of confidentiality.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside, but very close, analyst of the administration, who also spoke on condition of confidentiality.
The study of the past
The next shoe to fall may be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller about obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, of which there is now significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia is a form of attack to take advantage of our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will soon be back in front of the voters and perhaps eventually a panchayat of some of his own colleagues.
There are many questions, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1933, German officers were prepared to adopt a dictatorial policy against Hitler if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid so many years of slaughter.
Such history revolves around strange twists, and the unusual movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Now Americans are facing a number of strange twists like this.
What if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been living in boiling water since the newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly suggested recording the president and assumed incompetence for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times is unfair.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is proven not guilty in the Supreme Court despite the hard-hitting charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the middle for the Congress to which Mr. Trump is accountable?
If we fail in these exams, democracy will last for a long winter.
But after the lessons learned from Prague, I am confident that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, 30 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with swastikas on it.
With my inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about my future?

Ranger Graham Dorrance Rapid Vienna is optimistic ahead of the clash
Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna learned on Thursday that after a spectacular draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win against Austria would put them in a strong position to advance from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his debut until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result to make the leap to bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal is a very good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing that we could get something and came back with a point.
Maybe we would have drawn it in the end, but, overall, maybe the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and in the second half when we came out we were better.
Thursday, another big European night is
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because their result was good in the last match but, even with the crowd behind us who are with us, I am sure we will be able to go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, of course, because of my injuries and all the changes at the club, but now there is a factor that makes me feel good about this place.
The team is great and the guys are really enjoying it; the practice is also good.
Hopefully, we will be able to push ahead this time, be successful and leave the last season behind us".
Women are losing their sleep for fear of saving for their retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, some were still discussing it with family members
Almost half of the people in the nationwide study said they were discussing long-term care costs with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking steps to negotiate that", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
Where to start?
Talk to your wife and children: If you do not communicate your wishes in advance, you will not prepare your family for such care
Discuss with your counsellor and family where and how you want to receive care so that you can determine the costs, as this is an important factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you by explaining how to pay for those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to cover these costs or you can self-insure with your own property as long as you have the money
Get your legal documents out: Stop the legal battles
Get a health-care volunteer so you can hire someone you trust to oversee your medical care, and if you become unable to speak, make sure the professional follows your wishes
Also, think about your financial manager's name
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid even if you become incapacitated
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Keep these words in writing so that you will always be ready

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 344 people, with officials saying the death toll is likely to rise further.
Due to communication disruptions, relief officials were unable to get any information from Dongla Regency, which is north of Palu and near the 8.0 magnitude quake.
After the disaster, more than 17,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the Palu and Dongla on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 33,000 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongola is a regency in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi with a coastline of 30 km (17 mi) inland.
The Regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 22,220 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Gilt mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali on the other side of the coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster relief agency, tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past 18 years
In 1937, a tsunami in Dongla killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit West Dongla in 2017 which killed nine people.
From the seismic perspective, Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is constantly being hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, North Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 27, triggered a tsunami in 14 provinces, killing 229,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were Aceh residents.
2006: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April
Hundreds of people died in the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra
2005: A magnitude 7.0 earthquake south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2005: A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck near the city of Pudong, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,170 people were killed in the fighting.
2017: A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 180 metres, which destroyed more than a dozen villages and killed about 30 people.
2017: A devastating earthquake also hit PD Jaya Regency in Aceh, reminiscent of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami and creating havoc and panic.
No tsunami occurred at the time, but buildings collapsed killing more than 180 people.
2017: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 70 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped in the jungle.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of Alaska's vice governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, was arrested in the attack.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, on April 1, Vasilla, a Palin, Alaska, was arrested in connection with domestic violence, harassment and arrest in which domestic violence was reportedly resisted.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime, he took the phone away from the woman.
Palin is being remanded to the Met-Su pretrial facility and is held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report he appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, not guilty" when his appeal was asked,
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence crime report, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he had punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the Veterans Group in 2016 for her son's violent behavior from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: Shkreli killed by the tsunami
384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are likely to be down in the coming days.
The earthquake struck from central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video showing the moment of impact is being watched on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit.
Federal prospects seeking the death penalty for suspects in the New York City attack.
Federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Sefullo Sapov, a suspected perpetrator of the New York City attack that killed eight people, the first such sentence handed down since 1953.
Sapov, 30, hired a domestic depot rental truck to attack a bike path along Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, crushing pedestrians and cyclists with the truck.
To grant the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that it was done intentionally, and caused harm to people, to grant the death penalty, Southern District, New York.
According to the documents, the death penalty can be imposed by both courts, the court of appeal
Several days after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sapov on 22 counts of murder, racketeering which is used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and public violence and motor vehicle violence.
The prosecutor said the attack required a lot of planning and thought, and explained how Sapov did this heinous, ruthless and corrupt thing.
"Siflo Habibulyevich Sapov has caused damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angiani, Nicolas Clavs, Anne-Laure Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Earlies, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Medoosa and Alejandro Damian Pagunukov, notice from the Intent State".
Five victims had come from Argentina to roam.
It has been many years since the Southern District Court of New York handed down the death penalty in a penalty case.
Defendant Khalid Burns was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence was handed down in the 1953 New York federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted 2 years earlier of conspiracy to smuggle for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek resident Sepov showed no remorse after the attack.
He told the investigator that he felt better while doing it, police said.
Sapov told authorities that he was inspired to do this by watching ISIS video on the phone, according to the accused.
He requested to see ISIS's chanda in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty before 22 jurors.
David Patton, one of the government security officials speaking to Sapov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the critic's decision.
The demand for death penalty rather than life imprisonment is being made because life imprisonment will only cause pain to the families of the victims, Patton said.
Sapov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Fraz should be in charge of Brexit.
Nigel Fraz vowed to form a 'people's army' during a Tory conference performance today.
The UKIP leader said politicians needed to 'feel the heat' from the Euro-sect - as Theresa May's own MPs suggested they should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been out by now when Mr Fraze was Brexit secretary.
However, in approving her divisive positions, Mrs May has underlined that the Tories have joined a separate challenge against Brexit in the city.
The chief is trying to block his checkered bargaining plan amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies demanded that she move forward with her efforts to go with Brussels regardless of the backlash - and work to lift the uropractic and power between her bundle and 'anarchy'.
Mr. Bone told the Live Mean Live rally that he wanted the Chuck Cheekers.
He proposed that Farage should be made a friend and given responsibility for arrangements with Brussels.
If he was in control, we would have been out by now,' he said.
Wellingbor MP says: 'I'm for Brexit but we need to bite the cheek'
Establishing his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not go to fight a world war for the subsurvient.
We should make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone has rejected proposals that have replaced the General Assessment gift from the 2016 vote. 'The likelihood that British individuals will change their views and live together is a complete lie.
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkins was telling the columnist: 'I must say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers are disliked by the entire population, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is disagreeable with our rallying and our activists who really pound the boulevards and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he also added: 'When he keeps his promises, the Prime Minister keeps his work.'
Mr Fraze said the rally should be made to 'feel warm' to MPs on the possibility of closing down if they were going to repeat the elections held in the 2016 referendum.
'It is a matter of trust between the general public - and our political class - about us at present,' he said.
'They are trying to repeat Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you miss doing it.'
In a message to the excited crowd, he said: I want you to make our political class who are selling Brexit feel warm.
'We are activating the army of the common people of this country that won us Brexit and Sanu will never rest until we transform into a free, self-governing, happy United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, a march was held in Bannerghat before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A flurry of activity in the run-up to this week's rally has swept the Brexit flag against Treasury.
Labour peers Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the safety issue and endured them with a collective plea.
'It is the general population that reveals to us that they have a free-range IT framework with the hope of being able to rely on Ireland without the flies and, in addition to most of Canada's innovation, also for specific outcomes,' he said.
'It's a perfect farce.
There is no such thing as a great Brexit", he said.
Warren plans to take a 'funny look' at the run for president
US Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would "shed tears" over running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
President Donald Trump's running mate, the GOP State Republican, is running for re-appointment on November 1 against Geoff Diehl, who was a co-manager of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the focal point of the theory that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
Friday evening was his 36th meeting at the summit to be held in Holokae in which the light triad looked at the state of the city's corridor after work.
One participant asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our messy government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest made on the death of Sims of LSUs
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been apprehended.
The Baton Rouge Police Department sentenced Dietan Simpson to life in prison, which was announced at an 11 a.m. CET news conference on the 20th.
He had discharged a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in isolating the man found in the footage.
Sims, 20, was killed on the campus of Southern University on Friday.
"Wide Sims took a shot in the head and finally he breathed", police chief Murphy John Paul told the media on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade was moved to protect his partner and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was addressed and claimed to be on the scene, holding a weapon and admitting to shooting the Wide Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who had a childhood experience in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Roussin Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is the center of world attraction after winning the Sebastian Vettel after group requests
From the minute Voltaire qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes "would have a huge impact on the race of group appeals".
From the stand, Butts made a good start and drove Hamilton out to dry as he prioritized the identity of his two boys and Wattel welcomed his partner to attack.
Vettel went into pole for the first time and Hamilton was left to keep moving into traffic at the tail of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later made a lap and fell behind Wettle, but Hamilton pushed ahead after some wheel-to-wheel activity that saw the Ferrari driver left unconscious and beat him at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the framework and finished seventh before the end of the Principal Lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took a large part of the race to the lead when he put his tires on to sink the fastest Km Raikkonen for fourth.
He finally got into the wings on lap 44 but Raccoon was unable to build his momentum on lap eight, standing fourth.
It's a difficult day in light of the fact that Valerie completed an incredible job over the weekend and he was a true man of his word.
Hamilton said the group has made such a two-for-one equaliser.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, saying he did not dismiss a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the announcement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that individuals are "meaningful and horrible and uncomfortable".
"One thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate over the last couple of days is when you get upset, when you see people who are angry and mean and horrible and vague", he said.
"When you laugh at the discharge and the hole and then they say, 'I didn't do it.'"
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the paper - "He, she, what?"
Oh, no. I was just...
I did not leak".
All right, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak", he added to the senator's impression.
Feinstein was described by Ford back in July as having made claims against Kwanhaeff and was released by the end of September - although Feinstein denied that his claims originated from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leave his story out", Feinstein told the panel, The Hill reported.
"He requested that I keep it secret and he kept it classified".
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what horrible body language it was.
Maybe it wasn't, but it's the most compelling body language I've ever seen".
Moving forward with the Supreme Court's challenge, which found three women guilty of sexual misconduct, the president proposed that the Democrats were using their own end-time claims.
"They are solutions to regain control by any and all necessary means.
You see that the profligate, the scary, those who hurt them, they don't care, who they need to keep running to get power and power", Medialight told the president.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars had offered compensation for their Elite League misfortune on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at the Agraendrar Direc in Dundee on Saturday.
The giants Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieuil scored two main goals in the face of attacks.
Dwyer led the Giants before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took home-field advantage.
Two Lucus Lundwald Nielsen goals were previously adjusted for Dundee by French Bouchard.
This was the destruction of the third Elite League period for Adam Caffey's men, who fought back against the famous defeat to Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Saturday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the two sides' time with the Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opener came at 3:35 on the fourth minute with the help of Kendall McFall, assisted by David Rutherford as Buehler took the lead after four minutes.
In an open opening start, Sullivan led the home team once more after finishing 13:10 to make way for Matty Marquardt to become the supplier for Queenie's corner in 15 seconds.
Dryer ensured that the Giants took a lead in the primary break when he scored his second goal towards the end of the first period.

Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of people on the runway are saved from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a saint because he was the first to die for landing a plane safely from the ground while addressing several people.
More than 800 people have blown up logs and many are missing after a memorial explosion on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami.
The area continued to be inflamed due to the intense conflict and many plums were trapped in the trash in the city.
But escaping with his life without regard for his comrades, 21-year-old Antonios Gunwan Agong did not leave his post in the uncontrollable impact control tower of the Mutiyaar Seys Al Jowfri airport in Plough.
They were there to ensure that Batticaloa Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, had the option to exit safely.
When he thought it had collapsed he closed the traffic control tower.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Johannes Ciriat, said the election could have saved many lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We had arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Klimton to take him to a large emergency clinic in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him early today so the helicopter plough came.
"We are heartbroken to hear about it", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the loss of life could reach thousands with the country's disaster relief office, which is the entry point for the towns of Dongla, Sigi and Botong.
"The toll has yet to be accepted for expansion as many bodies were still under destruction, while many were not ready to be received", said office spokesman Suto Purvo Nugoro.
Waves reaching six meters have crushed the plough which will lay masses on Sunday.
Military and business aircraft are receiving support and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing bodies every minute
Clean water is scarce.
Small scale mandis are being looted everywhere".
John Gelfond, leader of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is committed to helping survivors but we have no clue what they will find there.
It is now in the form of a disaster, although it could be very bad".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday posted a base in Palu and told the country's military: "I am asking you to stay day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was not long ago hit by a devastating earthquake in the Longback, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nuugini now says one person is missing after a flooded submarine crashed
A plane that crashed into a Pacific modern bridge in Micronesia is currently reported missing, after one of the 47 people was first told and the crew had safely cleared the sinking aircraft.
The Hawaiian New Zealander said in a statement that on Saturday evening, a male passenger was unfit to be a representative.
The carrier said it was working with local experts, emergency clinics and agents to try to locate the man.
The carrier did not respond quickly to a request to provide more information about the passenger, for example, his age or nationality.
Local superstitious people helped rescue various passengers and groups after a plane crashed while trying to reach the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The plane reported that six passengers were staying at the medical clinic on Saturday and each of them was in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact timing of the accident are unclear.
The aircraft and the U.S. Navy said the plane departed in a broken-foot hull.
Some witnesses thought the plane had collapsed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janice said the plane had come down too low.
"It's an incredibly profitable thing", Jane said.
Janes said he and others thought about how to swim through deep water to the middle of a crisis problem on a sinking aircraft.
He said the airline's managers were cleaning up and were slowing down, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said improvements to the vanf helped sailors who worked closely to be rescued by using a transport pontoon to get people ashore before they sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have passed through the air crashes designated by the PNG over the past two decades, but so far none have been involved in the Air New Guinea.
Analyst burns woman alive on timeline at night
Indicted evidence itself narrates the evidence in the retrial of a man convicted of killing a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has long been acknowledged as an expert observer in the field of knowledge analysis.
He imagined for the jury how he used cellphone records to fix the incidents of 29-year-old opponent Quentin Tallis and 19-year-old wounded man Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said she had received field information from some cellphones, which showed Tallis was with Chamber the night of her passing, denying her previous cases, Clarice Leisure reported.
When she noticed that her mobile phone was with Chambers, during which time she had said she was with her partner Michael Sanford, police went to speak to Sefford.
Sanford stood up on Saturday and confirmed that he was not around the local area that day.
When the investigator asked if Tallis was cleaning up at the time that he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was lying in light of the fact that my truck was in Nashville.
Another anomaly was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for about fourteen days before he died.
Cellphone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers passed, Tallis deleted Chambers's texts, calls and contact data from her phone.
"She removed him from her life", Haley said.
The protest aims to start its end of moderation on Sunday.
The judge said that he expressed hope that he should go to the jury for the investigation in the early days.

Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple for removing "racist" text job gift
A New York midwife is suing a couple for discriminating against a mother-in-law who was fired from her job after receiving a misspelled passage that she is "another black guy".
The couple denied they were racist, calling the lawsuit tantamount to "money laundering".
The mother of two, Lindsay Plasco Fleckman, expressed dismay when it was discovered in 2016 that Gisele Morris, who arrived for her first day of work, was black, the new baby's caregiver.
"Not another black man", Mrs. Plasco Flexman wrote to her husband in writing.
However, instead of sending it to his householder, he sent it twice to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after his unintentional mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, who was African-American, saying that the midwife, who was, had done a menial job while she was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and sent home by an Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for six months' compensation at $350 a day when she was fired and for work for which she was initially hired without a fake contract.
She told the Friday Post, "I want to show them, look, you don't do that kind of thing", saying, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the claims that they were racist and said that terminating Maurice's job was a legitimate act, they were afraid that they would not be able to believe him after his crime.
"My husband sent her something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people", the owner, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Even if it was wrong, "would you put your child in the hands of someone you were struggling with?
What about your newborn baby?
Try to understand".
Calling the trial "money laundering", Plasco said his wife had only been pregnant for two months and was "in a very distressing condition".
"Are you following a cult?
The man from the capitalist bank said, 'That is not a good thing to do.'
The public has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, lashing out for their behaviour and logic, although the legal case is still ongoing.
The new letter reveals the secret, Paddington's publishers feared readers would not tolerate a relationship with a conversation.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult for the first time reader to put himself in someone else's shoes before it is published.
It is exciting to know what we know about Paddington's great success".
He said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "difficult" after his death last year, his father said, having worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book inspired by a small bear toy, he would have been optimistic about his work being rejected.
She said her father was extremely proud of her success at the end of the meeting, Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
He said, "They were very quiet people, and they were not a boastful people".
"But because Paddington was so dear to her, it was just like having a child who has achieved something: you are proud of them even if it is not really your doing.
He saw a kind of success of Paddington in that way, I think.
He always gave his credit to Paddington, even if it was his creation and his imagination".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2, Nice, where doctors' efforts to save her life failed.
"Ned was constantly saying it was really bad, he didn't expect to do it", said Mr. Mati Adnan-Laprois.
"Then I got a call from Ned to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I was going to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling I love you very much
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
He was prescribed medication by doctors to pump his heart, and was slowly dying as it left his system.
She had died a few days before the hand and all this was coming to an end.
Knowing that everything was opening up, I just had to sit there and wait.
I could not howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people in that situation.
I really had to pick it up".
Shri Matti Adenan-Laproys finally boarded the plane with other passengers, now mourning the loss of her daughter - knowing the hard times she was going through.
He said, "No one knows".
"I lowered my head, and tears were falling all the time.
But it was on the flight, it is hard to describe, I felt this difficult hour of pain for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her. "
Postcard of grieving women to stop suicides on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide have been working to save others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers on a Welsh bridge so people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Laidney, said his son was a promising cook with an attractive smile.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
He always said that his smile would light up any room.
However, he had quit before he died, because he was really in a dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was alone when he learned of his brother's death.
"I am always worried that the impact will be felt", said Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis designed the cards, "so that people know that there are still people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit silently - you need to talk".
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mr. Davis for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, not long after her mother's death.
"He doesn't say he was feeling bad or sad or anything", she said.
"We noticed a change in her behavior a few days before Christmas.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom of the cliff - when the children opened their presents he did not look at them or make any contact with them".
He said his death was a big shock for him, but he has to know: "He has left a hole in the family.
It fills us with tears.
But we all need to move forward and fight.

Since the FBI has begun investigating, Brett Kwanhoff's future hangs in the balance.
"I thought, if we could really achieve something like what he was saying - time-bound, time-bound - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, saying he feared the assembly was "moving away" between pro-imperialist support and dissent.
Why do Mr. Kwanhoff and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due to time.
If, as expected, the Republicans lose badly, then they will be very weak in their efforts to elect the person to be elected to the highest court in the country.
Kvanhoff, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he reconciled with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary, called the senator to help George W. Bush, and are pursuing Kvanhoff to give them their endorsement.
What happens after the FBI makes its own report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kwanhof can win at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and secure him a Supreme Court seat.
The case of a North Korean defector under Kim has 'fallen apart'
A South Korean gunmaker said North Korea has seen a decline in the number of defectors to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, Park Byung-seong said there were 1,127 cases of deserters last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high prices charged for smuggling people are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any official comment.
In a big way, North Korea finally offers South Korean citizenship to the North Koreans.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Because of the longest border with North Korea and the heavily fortified military zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, more people pass through China.
China considers Dalbadluwa as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South - which are technically on the brink of war - have developed in an effective manner in recent months.
The two leaders met in Pyongyang earlier this month for talks focused on denuclearisation talks.
In Singapore, it came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work towards a largely nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
'Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way in which we can take a unilateral disarmament initiative in such circumstances,' Mr Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kwanhof "hysterical", says he is uncomfortable serving on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanhof "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in a meeting on Saturday with the Texas Tribune in Austin.
"I didn't understand but thought if a woman had demonstrated like this, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to Kwanhof's testimony.
Kwanhoff emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kwanhoff was very emotional, sometimes crying out loud during discussions of his family and high school years.
She openly denounced the Democrats, calling the charges against her "ironic and collective character assassination", which was organized by liberal anger that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kwanhof's testimony proved she could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed she was biased against Democrats.
He said - "I think he's disqualifying himself with the things he said and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats".
Pelosi denied when asked if she would be impeached after Kwankhof was convicted and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only could they land in the Supreme Court, but they're now good enough to be in court", Pelosi said.
Kwanhoff is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about a possible Kwanhof ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she is considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kwanhoff questioned whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a conservative, biased person to go to court and be expected to say, 'Isn't this great?'"
And women should take care of it.
Months and years of anger are passing, it's a righteous maturity and she can't get it without crying.
Miss Steinem told me 45 years later, "When we're angry, we cry".
"I don't think this is normal, do you?"
She added, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive, who said that when she was angry she cried too, she was telling the person she was talking to, that she developed a technique, which means that when she got angry and started crying, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great.
Hanju is allowed as part of expressing anger as it is basically misunderstood
In a male-dominated office, one of my greatest memories at my first job, where I once found myself crying in a rage, was being grabbed by my neck with a washer by an older woman - who was a sharp manager I was always a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
He said, "Don't let them ever see you cry".
"They don't know you're angry"
They will be glad when they see you in mourning".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential visit.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a busy tugboat named Monkey Business and was thrown out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, greatly disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
He laughed and said to me 30 years later, "It wasn't a well-thought-out decision".
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and they needed one more.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind in raising money, and she promised that she would not enter the race until she had raised up to $2 million.
It was a losing battle
He noticed that some of his supporters who gave Marda $1,000 would only give $250.
Do they think I will get away with it? " he thought.
When she made the speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and target the delegate rather than the voter, and anger at sexism - she became angry.
Ms. Schroeder is described as saying how the press reacted to her? "You would have thought I was nervous".
"You might have thought that Kleneks was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they're going to put in my cemetery?
"He cried?"
How a US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of a trade war between the US and China was in disarray, and while the fight is not over yet, experts say tensions between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing over the long term.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year warned of imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week was impacted by new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has changed the type each time, most recently reducing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of US goods.
China has vowed to fight back against the American loser and the world's second largest economy is not likely to be shaken anytime soon.
To back down from Washington means to meet demands, but to publicly bow to the US would be a great embarrassment to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say Beijing can play its cards right, with the pressures of the US trade war reducing the interdependence of the two economies and supporting China in the long run.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger economic tailspin in any country is actually far more dangerous than people already accept", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that focuses on Asia.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Molame said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is very stable and safe for the progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
Government continued to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy
Due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures which targeted their daily lives and livelihoods, they are now offering all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of 2011.
Six crore people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mohalem had said that the Syrian state would have helped rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not accept unconditional aid or assistance for aid from countries that sponsor the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 points at Le Goal National outside Paris, France.
The USA has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The crown was withdrawn by Europe as Denmark captain Thomas Barron's team had scored 14.5 points to record their victory, they needed to beat the USA.
US star Phil Mickelson, who wrestled the majority of the tournament, threw his T-Shot on the par-3 16th hole in the water and won the match from Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his career, with 1-4 players having the opportunity to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Throbjoer Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Pulber who could play in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia had the best performance of a European-winning tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a bad year
So I thanked Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup back
It's for the team, and I'm glad I was able to help", Garcia said, becoming emotional after the European victory.
She gave the torch to her compatriot John Ram who defeated American golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles on Sunday.
"I think it's great to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said Raham, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
An odd statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 titles which is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to play well except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finu, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furke said after his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these guys, the way they played the game.
We gave Europe some bumps this morning.
We lost.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will get together again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 people and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to tip your cap.
We were defeated".
