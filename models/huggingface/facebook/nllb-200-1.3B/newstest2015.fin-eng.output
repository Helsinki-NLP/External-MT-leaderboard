The city of Juankoske will join the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The Juankoske City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal association, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent municipality.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately on the next municipal elections.
Municipal elections will be held next in 2016.
Since the annexation of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian forces are shooting at civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing to hold direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct a meaningful political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, whom Kiev and the West say are being aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian military forces were shooting at civilians.
The aim of the militiamen is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the residents of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Tire Repair Shop.
I was surprised to see the crowd arrive early in the evening.
The visitors were as expected over the two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Walls Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hip-hop parties, which means there's no pop, Kangas assures me.
A law that restricts the acquisition of explosives will come into force in Finland on Tuesday.
In future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Authority for permission to purchase or possess substances or mixtures which could be used as the so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is found in detergents and detergents, for example, but the levels in these detergents do not usually exceed the limits.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration coils.
However, the holding and use of the starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be continued until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with the Nairn and Pitlochry hotel robberies .
Two suspects accused of raping a woman at a hotel are awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rape which took place at the Pitlochry Scotlands Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman while she was unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself.
Webster is also charged with the second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Upper Nair on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of the Lord Justice Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Court of Appeal.
Super Raheem is outstanding Mario was outstanding
Just 19, Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the future of English football.
The White Hart Lane was a hotbed of electricity on Sunday as Liverpool, reinforced by Mario Balotelli, arrived to host Tottenham.
The Super Mario debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than in the Manchester City days.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian missed three quality field goals and only threw half of his 16 innings for his own team.
The pool fans, who already favor the player, are expecting better.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has put Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who has travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the star of the team was the center fielder Raheem Sterling, who missed the opening goal of the 3-0 win by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, is not just a powerhouse.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than Balotel, is in the opposing line like a fish in water.
This is not a common trait for a player who is at his best on the grass at about 21 miles [34 km] an hour.
Rodgers, too, deserves a lot of credit for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman told us after the game how Liverpool had systematically developed a North West Londoner who grew up on the Wembley ground from a mere midfielder into a more complete player.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra. "I am happy and proud".
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next Principal Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers like the Los Angeles Times have asked what orchestra he's going to take next.
Susannah Mälkki says she's starting her new assignment happy and proud.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the musical life of our country for over a hundred years, including performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the finest Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of orchestras before.
I look forward to our future cooperation", he says.
Employers' organisations meeting to negotiate pensions - Country - Regions - News - Karelian
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to the Member States.
The management of the SAK, the Akava and the STTK employers' associations will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the real pension negotiations are to continue.
The debate on the linking of retirement age to life expectancy has been a subject of discussion amongst the labour market organisations.
The organizations have promised a work solution by the fall, but the latest estimate is that it will be in this week.
The spit-pots.
The Women's Volleyball League team from Rovaniemi stumbled against the Vampula Athletes in the final of the Pichtiputaan training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula twisted a five-game stretch to win the game 3-2.
Last round, WoVo lost 15 to 11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of me the whole time.
The fight was good, but in the defense and the passing game, Vampula was a little better, Wowo's coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
Wowo's six was so fragile that the six-foot-tall American Jennifer Keddy's back was stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi was the center.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury and formed the most powerful combination of WoVos with Johanna Pekkarisen.
Jenna Middle, who started as a starter, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the final 1.5 innings.
The best part of the Vampula was the skilful Russian passenger and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who was circled as much as possible by WoVo.
Wowo's preparations for the league will continue next weekend when the HCK of Hamelin Castle arrives at the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "Merchant" at 6 p.m. for the official practice game.
Sunday, we're going to the gym for a repeat.

Ovarian cancer is a more common cause of death in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those in urban areas.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of them lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SOME FACT: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the women's health history over a seven-year period.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous medical conditions, and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
Women who were older and had a more widespread cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside of urban areas are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan believes that delayed diagnosis and difficulty in accessing treatment are possible reasons.
"Gynecologic oncologists are the best at treating this disease, and their clinics are mostly in big cities", says Jordan.
While telemedicine is becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, and programmes to support patients who are treated remotely.
Dr. Jordan's study shows that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Nea, a 33-year-old mother in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the station's car park operation in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
The city council decided on Monday that the proposed site plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be made available to the public at the service point in Oswieta.
The draft plan is being consulted by the Environmental Board and the Lapland Centre for Life.
The change in the layout will allow the city to continue to operate tourism-related motor-screening activities in the area.
The site is to be a park area, containing the area between the present Friendship Park and the river.
The proposal provides for a maximum of 200 motorised ferries to be allowed on site permanently between 15 November and 30 April.
Fuelling stations may also be located in a certain part of the area.
The new park area will also be open to freight traffic.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for use in winter for motor-skiing.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The park's green space and the change in its layout have been met with some loud opposition.
Residents of the neighboring apartment buildings have been both annoyed by the noise and concerned about the emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been investigated and no findings have been made in the reports that exceed the guideline values.
The new equipment is also more efficient than the old one.
The Amity Park parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel safari customers would have to be transported to the departure points by buses, which would be estimated to run 15 departures per day.
The area of the Friendship Park and its surroundings is also, according to the city, sufficiently large for the clocks, better than places presented as alternative starting points, such as the eastern side of the Ounas River bridges next to the boat launch.
The location of the Friendship Park is also good, as the activities may be extended in the future, for example to the Ounas Paviljong area.
The consolidation of the parking operation is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good business environment by allocating areas of sufficient quality to locations with logistical and operational advantages.
The Friendship Park is also listed as a motor-skiing starting point in the centre's sub-scheme, which has not yet become law.
The decline in housing is evident in the garden shops.
The decline in homeownership, particularly among those under 35, may lead to a decline in garden shops' turnover by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "target group" of garden sales by the age of 50.
According to a report in the Financial Times, tenants spend only 55 percent of the money spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study also found that more and more people live in highly urbanized housing without gardens, and that the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly covered with parking space, also threatening the estimated value of the garden sector of £5 billion a year.
In the Greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and it has the lowest per-household expenditure on gardening products in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Horticultural Society (RHS), an increase in rents or a shrinking garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's head of gardening consultancy, says that "for example, plants grown in portable containers are particularly popular with tenants because such containers can be incorporated in the changeover if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the period 1997-2005 was a booming period for the horticultural retail sector, as the number of households owned and the wealth accumulated increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will be boosted this year by better weather conditions, after the worst of March and April last year.
Turkey is interrogating a US diplomat over a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced American diplomat to provide an account of the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy's spokesman and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Internet news site The Intercept have reported that leaked documents by former National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was a prime target for U.S. and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report, saying that all major powers have been spying on each other.
An earlier report on the German Central Intelligence Agency's spying on Ankara provoked an even more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze will star in a new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been attached to her leading role in a new Finnish film.

Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2003 film Invasion of the Barbarians.
She has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's Butterfly in the Glass Picture.
The male lead in the movie "Two Nights in the Morning" is Mike the Rising.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan police chief accused of corruption
The whistleblowers presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià city officials at the Mallorca prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, a resort town on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shopkeepers and bar owners in the Magaluf region, known for its wet parties.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under investigation after several Punta Ballena street business owners filed corruption charges against him, Punta Ballena street is home to most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the whistleblowers presented evidence of the extortion by police and Calvià city officials at the office of the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers on corruption charges and they are being questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The nationwide newspaper ABC reported that nightclub owners were angry about the government's biases, which made their business significantly more difficult.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival", one business owner told the court.
You're not gonna destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video went viral showing an 18-year-old British vacationer having oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawling.
Since then, the island's authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year and the nightclub owner and the pub crawler Carnaghe were jointly fined EUR 55 000.
The so-called balconing trend, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, has also become popular in Magaluf, where alcohol-related accidents have been reported, with people jumping from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after a summer spent in bomb shelters as rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement as rockets bombarded communities in southern Israel, but the scars of the fighting remain.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers at the Pashosh day care center were removing debris from walls and slides before the children arrived after a rocket hit the day care center.
'We are a little scared but also excited,' says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, in an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area are in dire need of routines.
Shani Bart, Bart's 11-year-old daughter, says that returning to school after a long time feels "a little weird".
'We've had some difficult times, when we didn't leave home,' he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or fled to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape rocket and grenade fire.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are skeptical about returning after a Palestinian shell killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian resistance.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised that the education and safety of the children would be taken care of.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' demands for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea lanes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disputed the death toll, saying that at least half of those killed were soldiers, although it has had no conclusive evidence to support this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza-based militants fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south, during the fighting.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in over 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, school officials moved the start of school last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children", said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a shelter at a school in Gaza City.
According to the most commonly used measure, house prices have risen the most in seven years during the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
The increase was accompanied by a total increase of 4,2% in prices in June, July and August, which is higher than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9%, more than double the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not increased steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data shows that house prices rose by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next most active, with an average price increase of between 5 and 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% a year as a result of government spending cuts.
Lawless said that the start of spring in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which will be a real test for the housing market.
"Given the upward trend in the sale of homes for auction, the generally busy sales season and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that house price increases will continue over the next three months", says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record-breaking audiences to Mäntä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer in Mäntä.
By the end of August, the Serlachius Art Museum had received over 70,000 visitors.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classics of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mäntän's visual arts weekly said on Monday it had set a record for visitors, with 14,500 people attending the Moment event this summer.
You're not used to these numbers.
People have been kicked out of doors and windows", says Pauli Sivonen, director of the Serlachius Museum.
Page estimates that the Serlachius museums will have a year-round attendance of close to 100,000 this year.
In previous years, the number of visitors has been about 40,000.
Mänttä-Vilppulas, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11 000 inhabitants.
The director of the museum, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always a phenomenon when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent", he says.
The hope is that the art season will continue well into the summer.
In the fall, the Art Museum will open new exhibitions.
Police are investigating a robbery in the last four days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night, a business building was broken into on North Avenue.
The perp had taken a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from a truck on Deep Road.
Between Sunday and Monday, the ferry with its tractor-engined engines had left the port of Petenniska.
The sound boat was a Kalapalta-branded light-blue outer and yellowish inner.
Inside, it had the words "OIVA" on the top of the box.
A couple of suspects in the robbery have already been arrested by the police.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into on Tikkapuronti.
A police dog found a trail and a man in his 20s from Paltamo was found hiding in the woods under a bush.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
The missing methamphetamine led to a murder charge in Kajaan .
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine led to the murder of a Ka'an man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his stepson and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Ka'an, whom he suspected of being a drug trafficker.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that he was with another man as the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police squad stopped a car in which a group of people were burning clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to the burned clothes, the car was found with a severed rifle.
The Kainu District Court will rule on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the National Weather Service, an August that is as warm as this one occurs on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Meteorological Institute indicate that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was between one and two degrees.
The heat of July and August made the whole summer warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the entire summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, with a temperature of 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hit me".
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley, in the British Midlands, in 1958 to a family of seven Jamaican immigrants.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently rehearsing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father and which was developed from a Radio 4 series.
The vocal tracks are a mix of reggae and rap in an upbeat rhythm.
Henry's been having to go through some painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy a lot since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
You never saw his face, just a voice saying, "Shut up".
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, would visit my father in a pub and discuss such things as the shape of a beer bottle or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never talked to him about that sort of thing.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal foundry in Dudley, thus gaining insight into what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are better now than they were then.
Today, the melting pot is a little brighter, but it is actually a dark, smoky, labyrinthine depth, filled with flames, smoke, and smoke, reminiscent of the underworld.
Dad used to go to the bathroom and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the melting pot dirt off of himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get food on the table for us, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood was marked by a lack of parental intimacy.
My father never kissed me or said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother got sick shortly before she died that we started telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, he has been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop that hug!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She 's a great mother .
Henry is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why can't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother's death.
When I began to suffer from severe obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a complete change.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce my symptoms.
It 's very difficult .
and boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard may reflect his change as his career progressed.
After receiving much positive feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he has turned his attention to the theatre.
Next up was the comedy of errors and August Wilson's Fences.
Acting in the theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only 16 years old, working in a factory.
A disc jockey spotted her on stage doing impersonations and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's television career began in the mid-'70s, and for a long time, he said, "I was the only black impersonator and comedian on television".
Henry learned on the job.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes on a slide between 1975 and 1985, while I was living the starry life and I was on television.
In the Lenny New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which characters performed as black people in makeup, so Henry ended up doing comedy for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been a part of it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work at major events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet, the award-winning, long-running British TV favorite and light entertainment program was also a "serious parody of black people".
Henry worked on another comedy series in the '80s that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s, Henry became known for his character of chef Gareth Blacklock on the sitcom Chef!
The next decade Henry spent in commercials, documentaries, TV series and film parts, but after his Lenny.Henry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: 'What are you going to do next, Len? It looks like you're just driving around or taking side roads now.
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series What's So Great About...?
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school, and I thought it belonged to the white middle class, who wore socks and had money.
That's why the Shakespeare thing scared me.
And all the people we interviewed on the show -- Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench -- they said, "Try it".
Don't throw the whole idea away until you know what you're talking about.
You'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was being put back in place.
This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was performed.
The play was a success in the end.
Apparently, they expected it to fail, but it didn't.
Soon after, Henry starred in the comedy "Errors".
Suddenly I was performing at the National Theatre of Great Britain, and I couldn't quite believe it was real.
At one point, I thought, "Wow, you've changed".
Once there was a technical problem in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
A little voice in my mind said to me, "You're gonna have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again".
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked off the stage, and part of me was breathing a sigh of relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others to deal with.
You're part of the play, stay in your role
Henry Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words to "Fences" was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing. It makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods: "This is what you should do".
Of course, Henry says this in a WONDERFUL tone.
So I decided to stick with it.
I love this job, honestly.
I love the rehearsal rooms.
But Henry is still a comedian at heart: little comic boys constantly interrupt our conversation as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of willpower, for immediate praise from an unfamiliar audience seems dangerous.
If you keep craving it, it can lead to a dead end.
I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater sometimes when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit next to a conductor who helps shape the whole journey from start to finish, and I don't think I ever want to give that feeling up.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really fun.
The play is a continuous story, and I enjoy doing that.
I love stories. I like stories.
People love stories. They love it.
Kenya to create a registry of civil servants to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun to create a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove ghost workers from government payrolls.
The government announced in a press release that workers who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive their wages.
The government suspects that thousands of them will still be paid after they leave office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to eliminate public sector corruption when he took office in 2013.
Earlier this year, an audit found that "ghost workers" were spending at least $1 million a month on wages and other financial misconduct.
The government suspects that salaries are paid into the account even after a person has died or left office, reports BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials will have to register themselves in the coming weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
The notice says that anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly streamline the public sector, as it will determine how many people are actually working in their jobs, and it will also clean up payrolls at both levels of government, thus solving the 'problem of redundant workers', says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the Ministry for Decentralisation and Planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The current budgetary situation shows a deficit of some 9.4 million for the year.
The potential means of efficiency were discussed as being to compromise on the scope and level of services, as well as on purchases of services, sales of assets and subsidies, and increasing tax and payment revenues.
The target of EUR 10 million for investment is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no promise of relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and the cut in government shares to 5%, further undermine the outlook.
The aim of the seminar is to explore new ways of balancing the economy.
The city council is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be converted into a strategic target, says Kimmo Heinonen, chairman of the city council.
The City Council returned the proposals to the management team for preparation.
The City Council's proposals will form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the draft budget is forwarded to the City Council and the City Council through the Board of Trustees.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of plotting against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "plotting against the government", local media sources report.
Police did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale crime ring and monitoring telephone calls.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) said the police operation was part of an operation planned by Islamist leader Fethullah Gulen against him and others in power.
Not all children will return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he is committed to defending the country for future generations:
September Day ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the head teacher at the Slaviansk school where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that the children will be able to receive an education that will benefit them in the future.
Traditionally, the first day of school celebrations include children's writing shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the libelous tweet was unauthorized.
Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmed Twitter account posted a defamatory image of the Democratic district attorney on Sunday night as he was hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another tweet in which Perry vowed he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent from my account without my authorization.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it", the subsequent release said.
Perry's backup teams did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a derogatory joke about Travis's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month in which Perry was indicted, and Perry is a potential candidate for president in 2016.
The headline of the tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times the permitted number of times... but when I do, I'm accusing Governor Perry of pointing the finger".
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg office did not lead a grand jury investigation into Perry.
The investigation was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has maintained his innocence and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the charges, saying the law that is charging Texas' longest-serving governor is ambiguous in its interpretation of the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in federal subsidies to the federal public integrity unit that operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by posting a picture of himself jogging on a lake with the caption "Here Comes South Carolina!" on Twitter.
Berkeley says the housing market is back to normal .
One of London's leading developers has warned that the housing market in the South East of England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
The capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases, as well as fears of a widespread credit bubble, which prompted the Bank of England to place limits on home loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-end builder Berkeley, said on Monday that since the start of the current financial year, the market and trading volume have returned to normal after the 2013 peak, adding that this has enabled a stable operating environment.
The housing market in London was booming during the recession, with foreign investors flocking to the capital.
According to the Mayor's Register, house prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, well above the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose for about a fifth of the year to reach a price peak of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London a less attractive destination for property in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible 'Map Tax' ahead of the May general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported tighter lending rules, would lead to a low level of market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England's latest data on Monday showed a decline in the number of loans approved in July, suggesting a cooling of the housing market.
Real estate broker Hamptons International has cut its 2015 forecast for London property prices, saying prices will fall by 3 percent as the index that measures homeowners' opinion of prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of deals in London's most expensive areas, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, fell by a quarter from a year earlier, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley, which has increased its property sales revenue to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that the demand for 'a well-designed, right-of-kind product in the best locations has remained stable and thus sales have remained strong'.
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% year on year, to £380 million, and turnover increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that the Berkeley Year's earnings are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the full year's pre-tax profit is £450 million.
The shares of Berkeley were trading at a flat rate on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at £23.96.
A hacker leaked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence to the Internet .
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have the photos of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A representative of the Hunger Games star confirmed that the photos are authentic and convicted the hacker of "Space Squad" for violating privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will face prosecution.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, apparently had fallen into the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple's iCloud storage system.
It's not known how much of the footage is real, although Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those watching the photos taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago, I hope you're in a good mood", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickelodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied the authenticity of the photos and tweeted that these so-called nude photos of me are INTRODUCTIONAL, don't you understand?
Let me finish this from the beginning .
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the photos of the star.
Only here, we're gonna see an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter J.
They slipped, that's the best picture of what happened, gradually they were separated like a cardboard box in the rain.
Only then did he hear from a woman that she was too serious, too hard-working, too intense, too detached, and maybe even a little bit picky.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yeah, he was sharp, like a pollen.
The latest victim of his spike was a relationship that was in its infancy but had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could ease his lonely boredom and perhaps even bring some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicate, gentle beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north, which was even more remote and far from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion whom Kevern thought was his aunt, and she had inherited a house in a wet but paradise-like valley, aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
Pipes were leaking, spiders were in every bathroom, spiders had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, the garden was growing weeds that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like a children's fairy tale, menacing and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was shortlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The nominations will be published next week .
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on a dirty terrace chair in the middle of a long lawn, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening with distracted attention to the reception through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, as Ailin's sun-tinted crossed legs brought to Kevern's mind a song sung long ago by a long-forgotten black-headed ancestor and often heard by his father on the chimes of the cabin downstairs.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned  nothing was actually banned  they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as the word itself was forgotten.
Public opinion achieved what laws and proclamations had not: just as in literature people chose to read heroic memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so in music they preferred ballads.
In the wildness of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing serenades to Ailin's big feet in a cocky, comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand. He was a little bit off.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller", Kevern told him, and he naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done, until the letter j slipped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word with a J and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it's not a very fun game now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to cleverness.
The unpredictability of it made people nervous.
And jazz was the art of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, he had been introduced to jazz music through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it's likely that he didn't remember a time when the most popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws were needed, no coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted gratefully - grateful, as if they had been saved by a fortune-telling trade - the principle that each group did things that were natural to it.
Because of their temperament and physical characteristics, people of Afro-Caribbean ancestry were best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they were like natural gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working telephone to use for business.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When THAT WAS KILLED, THAT WAS KILLED came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled in a hurry for fear of being accused of burning flames and of being next caught by them opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning waterpipes and continued their lives staring down at the ground, depressed by boredom.
Each one according to his gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and she had difficulty understanding how the offensive words Kevern had just sung could ever be set to music.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe the bigfoot thinks so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He'd already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
Not a word would pass through the sound of the giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He was gonna say the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers in front of Ailin.
Ailinn thought he was weird even now.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
Ailinn shaved her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the world but Ailin's huge, curly hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so", he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little bit.
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too soon for that.
"I find you attractive because of your fat ankles", he tried to make it right.
I'm perverted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe her father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her balcony chair, knocking over the receiver and spitting out the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only of spinach, so he couldn't use it as the cause of the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your fat head is what twists me in your way", he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that was in her eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life on the remote northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had been basically the same as life here.
The same huge, swirling sea that was waving against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more demonic than their smuggling and smuggling ancestors after the incident, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat up any woman who dared to resist or harass them.
A fat head?
He'd see a big fist if he wasn't careful!
Kiss first had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads that pumped the recipient out.
Kevern thought that was too much, because sucking was hostile in itself.
Ailinn Solomon's body language told her to leave.
He pulled himself up from the balcony chair like an old man.
Ailinn felt exhausted, too, but Kevern's depth of grief caught her by surprise.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him as he went, just as her traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window, the man who was the cause of her difficult life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Keverne and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man with his back turned, wrinkled, ashamed, beaten, with all the will to fight gone. Why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember having seen anything like it before?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the private public opinion measurement institute in Ofnow, made a brief study of the continuation of mild to moderate violence in those areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, of violence was most likely, given the money and energy spent on its suppression.
"Much has been done, and much remains to be done", he wrote, "to compensate for the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought and often won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers that stretch across the pastures, human tenderness has been little known over the centuries.
But some things cannot be eliminated completely.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it engenders.
People weep in sentimental ballads, covet stories of triumphs and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty is holding sway in rural communities and urban communities, and there is evidence of a new, more vicious pattern of strife in homes, workplaces, our streets, and even in playgrounds.
"You have a lamentable tendency to dramatise", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered his eyes to the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to assert his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask", said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism and feminism".
This is a job that doesn't have prejudice.
We are servants of an unbiased society.
While a certain degree of hypersensitivity is in itself perfectly acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted conclusions, such as the one you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Shouting "HERE IT HAD HAPPENED", "WHAT HAPPENED", as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, is destroying the earth's basic life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed a directive that Ofnow had been distributing to the country for a quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and a word sung is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you mean", replied Esme Nussbaum in a low voice, when he was sure that his instructor had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively cured as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that led to the original SHOW, WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HAPPENED.
This time, though, we will not spill our hatred and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz built a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far", he said, "in describing as mistakes the things our grandparents may or may not have done".
You're also going too far in saying that they poured out their hatred and distrust on others.
Someone in your position shouldn't have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we don't talk about "us" or "them".
There was no "us" or "they".
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are to be quite honest, in that chaos", Esme dared to continue, "no group in society can say that it behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, good or bad.
That was then.
There is no need to talk about it any more. We agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to make accusations, so it is unnecessary to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is some way to do so.
But what's the point of the past if we don't learn from it?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report", he said, indicating that Esmen was about to leave.
The next day, as he was going to work as usual, he was hit on the sidewalk by a motorcyclist whose driving was described by passersby as "cold and furious".
Coincidences are happening.
Lesotho army denies planning attack; PM remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied staging an attack to overthrow the government and said they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after being told he had received death threats.
The army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack, saying that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics".
"Lesotho's defense forces have taken action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause trouble", he told Voice of America.
Clayson Monyela, the South African government spokesman, said that the military's actions looked like an attempt at revolution.
'Although no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces show the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt on all sides', he says.
According to Lesotho military officials, soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital is in a calm mood.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has been trying to fight corruption.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's external relations policy, which is the basis for the EU's external relations policy.
He denies that he has thus undermined the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up data centre in Newfoundland
The computer company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Newfoundland, a location which the company declines to specify.
In a press release, Microsoft states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
Microsoft says the hub is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
The location of the centre had previously been speculated as Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will close down its Oulu office entirely, which will result in the loss of jobs for some 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off no more than 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft's communications director, Camilla Lindfors, tells STT that the company is not commenting on how many people the new data center will employ.
The opening of the data centre in Newfoundland was reported on Monday by the Handelsblatt.
A man is charged with running over a girl at a traffic light.
A 78-year-old man has been charged with the hit-and-run of a three-year-old girl at a traffic light in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is charged with running over a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, East Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 carelessly, causing injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC has ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I took these photos myself at a family party using several cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always double-check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other components are waterproof.
Also, adjust the camera settings to match the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras, or combination cameras and video cameras, have a setting that optimizes the underwater conditions.
Also, before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can only hold at 5 feet, others even 50 to 60 feet.
See our shopping guide and reviews for both standard and waterproof models.
Take multiple pictures. Many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to zoom in, whereas action cameras often do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and you may or may not be able to get a good image.
So take a bunch of pictures.
If your camera also allows for framing, which means taking multiple shots at the same time at different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced as it goes deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake, or ocean.
This also allows you to draw more colors; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more so underwater, because light conditions are poor.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle, meaning that the photographer must be close to the subject in order to fill the whole frame.
China won't let Hong Kong elect its leaders  protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to vote for candidates in the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district as activists begin planning and implementing demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The decision by the Chinese People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to expel any candidate who does not obey Beijing.
'This was to be expected, but it is still outrageous', says Democratic Party chairwoman, MP Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an authoritarian government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that a general nomination for the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK handed Hong Kong over to China, Beijing has promised the people of the region that it will be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also made clear that China wants to tightly control the election process through a nominating committee run from Beijing.
The new clause says only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the biggest and most high-profile protests in the region for years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the business district unless Beijing grants Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was issued, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the protest, the organizers announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and would create waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement posted online, the organizers said that the movement "considers Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be implemented if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way forward".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been lost and the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement for days and on Sunday security was tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, many feel that the city's residents are slowly losing control.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has created competition for goods and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and freedom of expression are being lost under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement for its demonstrations threatening Hong Kong's livelihood and business.
"The protest they're talking about could lead to big financial losses, depending on how many people are involved and how long it lasts", says Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
This kind of image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are the henchmen of the Western powers in the midst of the revolution.
This summer, activists held an informal voting rights referendum, which drew a total of 780,000 people - over a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest pro-democracy protests in the region.
The American prom tradition is hitting British universities: Private jets for new students
We are excited to meet this demand by creating the first luxury travel option in Britain for today's students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the customer's arrival at the university is as memorable as possible.
Stewart said there's a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise have to haul their belongings across the country in loaded cars.
Combined with the many VIF features, we are ready to provide today's students with the easiest and highest quality transportation to university.
The company representative said that no reservations had yet been made because the service was just being set up, but added that "students will start making orders in the coming weeks".
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students have very different expectations and aspirations than when they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, and it is more important than ever to create a lasting first impression, and VIF is the right way to do that.
However, the National Union of Students criticizes the service as unrealistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the organisation's Higher Education Division, "the service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the majority of students".
Many people start their studies this month shocked by the level of the cost of living, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has lagged behind the dramatic rise in basic living costs, and only the next month can you start to wonder where you could find thousands to spend on something as simple as getting to campus.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted the old working conditions, which had recently been changed, back.
The salary increases are also to be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Prison officials have been protesting symbolically against new working hours for a month, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite meetings between prison workers' organizations and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are underway, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Department for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The prison workers' union is expected to join the protest, along with members of the Ministry of Interior's trade union.
Basketball: fans' cheer almost too much: Sasu Salin had to pass out on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his bitter match against the United States and to wipe out the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his stand-up decisions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost passed out on that field at the end, the encouragement was so great.
He was blind, he couldn't help it.
The noise and the white crowd was almost too much for me.
The hall's moment of power included nine surfaces in a fast-paced fashion, balloon shells, plates and a tapestry of everything that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state that made it all work.
They're just gonna come from somewhere someday, now to a place of incredible importance, Piggybacked.
That's my role.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was nice to see that others had caught on.
It's got the whole gang.
Salin is the team's cheerleader and spirit creator, so it's no wonder his example lifted the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big, hard-core Ukrainian five.
After 32 years, Finland's World Cup: the previous one was remembered as a brutal match
Heikki Montonen (O.K.) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish representative at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was a fierce match against France at the beginning.
"The refereeing was blatant in the deciding ball of that match", recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams were already in the back row.
Suddenly, the game was still going on.
We lost it 2-3, and then the crazies got even crazier", Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montos and finished 17th.
Now Finland is back in the world's favourites when the World Cup in Poland kicks off this Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball in 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as before, but the quality and skill is now more.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is getting faster", Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player pool has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to go from the beginning to the end.
Then it can get tough", says Kosonen.
The Squirrel
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in the lead in the winning match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a regular in the World Cup.
Let's hope we can get to number 17.
South Korea and Tunisia should be defeated", said Parkkali.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were the winds of Tunisia.
Sauna and evening tea at the Sailor's Church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program for the 1982 World Cup.
Kari Kalin (O.K.) stretched with his teammates.

The finalists are still recording the songs of the competition.
"I'll always remember the moments of the race", says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the credit"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini courageously offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his supporters once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook post that the Cita dog he was with in the mountains on Thursday hurt his jaw.
The injured dog could no longer walk on the steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure and pull it a little bit forward, but its legs just didn't hold up, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said no help came from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from passersby.
By the time it got dark, things were starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, two travelers happened to be there to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father, Tuomo.
The men had been visiting Galdhøpiggen, Norway's highest mountain, and were heading for their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells us in the message he sent to Evening News.
Soon a German man came along with a travel mattress.
From the mattress to the Citadel, they got a pair of mattresses that they put on the injured dog.
A German man came a moment after us, as we were trying to figure out what to do with the dog, and carried the dog down the hill in his arms for a moment, Soini says.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation.
The dog was brought down with a field mattress.
Soin said that the performance was not physically difficult, but in the difficult terrain, the carrying was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was successfully brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen went on Facebook to search for "international heroes" to thank them once again.
His calls were answered on Sunday, but the German is apparently still unavailable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I haven't thanked them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and honor, and I am forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soins were on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: "Cita says she's doing better!
Susanna Mälkkiä is presented as the principal conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra
The three-year period of the Memorandum would start in autumn 2016 and end in spring 2019.

He is also an internationally renowned conductor and received the Pro Finlandia medal in 2011.
Currently, John Storgårds is the chief conductor of the City Orchestra.
The Beautiful and the Bold The Beautiful and the Bold returns after the summer break.
The opening sequence's name suggests a few questions.
The most popular Finnish soap opera of all time, The Bold and the Beautiful, returns from the summer season.
The title of the episode is, in a way, "Oral Happiness with Eric".
The evening programming for the episode reads:
Eric and Donna discuss their family relationships, order a snack, drink white wine, and recall their love story.
Eric is loyal to his collar style.
She's chosen the color of her lunch shirt, white, which is a little yellow.
Ridge is offering Katie support as she deals with the trauma she's caused to Brooke and Bill.
Ridge hasn't gotten over his problems yet either.
Bill's in Brooklyn, trying to sort out his own conflicts.
Brooke doesn't like him going there to try to get her back.
'I want Ridge, not you, Bill.'
Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a false diagnosis.
For most of her youth, Karin Rodgers thought she had only a few years to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT, which is a group of inherited disorders that damage the extracellular nerves of the brain and spine.
According to charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in Britain have CMT, which causes motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and numbness in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia, which has a very low survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and would die before he turned 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two, she says that as a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
I fell down every day, and I took longer to do anything than anyone else.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13, he underwent several operations on his ankle to straighten his legs, and as the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers that said he had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When I got the information from them, I was in a state of shock and panic.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 and would die before I was 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my functioning.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17, he found that his gait had not gotten as bad as he had thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was delayed", he says.
The charity CMT UK is organising CMT Month to raise awareness of the disease.
A 100th migrant found in a coal truck in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going", said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
Police said that the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece and another 800 to 900 euros to get to Serbia.
For a population of two million, a large number of illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled Syria's bloody civil war.
Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
The papal consorts Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the Scottish independence movement.
According to the Guardian, the bands are to perform a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence movement.
The Scottish independence referendum will be held on 18 September.
In his statement, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for Scots that comes only once in a lifetime.
In the past, actor Sean Connery, among others, has expressed support for independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have bet on the Scots to remain part of Britain.
The pro-independence movement has been defeated in the Gallupe.

The sales of clothing products were also clearly lower than in the previous summer.
The retail value of daily goods, on the other hand, increased by almost 3% in July compared with the previous year.
The largest increase was in retail stores and large supermarkets.

Areva-Siemens: The third reactor at Olkiluoto will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided TVO with an updated timetable for Olk Credit 3.
According to the Areva press release, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the request for approval of the reactor automation systems.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach land to Bottax - worth about €60,000
The municipality of Nastola donated a 1.4 hectare plot of land on the shore of Lake Kärk from Villähte to Valtteri Bottas, a formula cook.
The city council showed fairness to the sport and was unanimous in its decision.
No noise was heard at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Municipal Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
The Botts gift shop has seven farm buildings.
The city's gonna take them down this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the property within two years.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthday and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited elementary schools every year to tell about his sporting career and life.
And hopefully, the mayor says, it'll continue.
The mayor estimates the value of the beach land at EUR 40000-60000
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The land has been in the municipal ownership for over ten years.
Nastola has had varying successes over the decades, holding successful athletes in the community with donations.
World champion Aki Parviainen in the javelin throw and world champion Wind Matinsalo in aerobics received tons of private homes from the municipality and built modest private homes.
Instead of staying in Nastro, however, they sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola to find work and then moved elsewhere after the change in living conditions.
Bottas is a native of Natal and his situation is different, Syracuse is in and believes Bottas will stay in his hometown.
Hull cleaned up the offense with a record-breaking score for the Hernandez team .
The league's Hull investment fund has set a club record for the acquisition of Uruguayan national team player Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez is trading for Hull's Italian partner Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B and won promotion to the top flight of Italian football.
For the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
Last summer, in the World Cup finals, Hernandez came on as a substitute in two games.
"Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we've come in a short period of time", said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull announced that they had also acquired Senegal captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russian space test failed , sex-trip geeks killed
Five of the Russian spacecraft sent into space to breed have died, the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geeks traveled on the Photon-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning, Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and behaviour of geckos in weightless conditions.
The study involved one male and four females.
As strange as this experiment may sound, it was intended to be serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of geckos' eggs.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on humans when they are in a state equivalent to that of a human being for longer periods of time, as illustrated in the July issue of the New Statesman.
Roscosmos says they're working on the time of death and cause or causes of death.
According to Interfax, passengers who were crossed out as "sexy" froze.
Another surprise is that the fruit flies that traveled in the same Foton-M4 survived the journey effortlessly and also developed a growth spurt.
France has arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport.
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities announced the news on Sunday.
Authorities tracked down the man after he used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the border into Syria.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, and alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, according to the authorities, but he is currently living in France.
French intelligence had tracked him before.
In France, authorities have expressed concern that radicalized youths drawn to the wars in Iraq and Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French nationals or persons registered in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, have returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
We have a good chance of winning .
The basketball team's hopes for a place in the playoffs are at stake as Finland faces Ukraine in their second World Cup match today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains in the next stage.
Ukraine is a good team, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the tournament on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who commands the Ukrainian national basketball team.
The key player for Ukraine is the director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100m world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter's a fast guy, but yes, we've played against those guys before and we need to get our norm defenses in shape, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than in their defeat to the United States yesterday.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee you that you'll see a normal pack of wolves in the field, Möttöl said.
The alleged nude photos of Hollywood stars are circulating online , some confirmed to be real .
A series of nude pictures claiming to portray well-known public figures are circulating on the Internet.
One of them, actress Jennifer Lawrence, has been the victim of a "nude-picture" campaign.
TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, threatened by law enforcement.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images circulating about her are genuine.
She took those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the horrifying trouble that was taken to get them.
I feel sorry for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes, according to the website.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says that the images that go under her name are fakes.
There are also real or fake nude photos of at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka-painter criticized his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Vettel League.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match well describe the current mixed situation at the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeping coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything", Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala wasn't happy with the poor defense.
The players' movement in Hong Kong has been very active this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Vitala have also changed to a linear pace.
The game of roulette has also given many young gamblers opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here", Viitala said, without naming any individual players.
Hong Kong's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, agreed with Vitala to some extent.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to the training and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team", Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids time to play.
If they don't want to take that seat and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately when the partners are constantly changing.
This season has not been two times in a row with the same lineup.
Especially on defense, the team's changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position", Kuqi said.
Honka is in the playoffs after losing to VPS, tied with TPS, the second-last.
With seven rounds left in the league, the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to No. 1.
I've never let a team down, and I'm not gonna let it down now.
We are definitely not going to fall out of this series", goalkeeper Viitala threatened.

He says that such a series "has never been seen and will never be seen".
"Hold your breath", says Aalbæk Jensen in the release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has become known in recent years for his high-profile media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
For television, he directed the Kingdom series in the 1990's.
01.09.2014 15:20 The Lidl retail chain seems to have won over the Finns, at least if the figures are to be believed.
The turnover of the Lidl Finland Kommanditary Group, which operates the Lidl Group in Finland, continued to grow in the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company also increased its profit.
Profit before tax amounted to EUR 79,6 million, compared with EUR 56,4 million a year earlier.
The turnover increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1,2 billion.
It was a 25 percent increase.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The operating profit margin was 7.1%.
The German-owned Lidl's financial year runs from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company reports that it paid EUR 13,7 million in tax to Finland for the financial year ending in February.
The company, which has been steadily expanding its chain of stores, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
In Finland, there are currently 142 Lidl stores and more than 4 000 employees.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
The Ice Bucket contestant has his chin in place.
British woman Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when she was poured ice-cold water on her face that it damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been admitted to the hospital after she screamed during the Ice Bucket challenge so loudly that her pancreas went into position.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when she was poured ice-cold water on her face that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed I felt my gums start to stiffen", he tells The Mirror.
They pour the trash on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident .
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my gums were locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the ER.
A 20-year-old British man who took part in a highly recommended challenge on Tuesday was taken to hospital, where his jaw was reattached.
The video has become an Internet sensation, and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The viewpoint of the wolf howling: How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
I had a great party today.
That was the statement of basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland played France in the European Championship final at the Maroons ballroom in Athens.
Pehkonen was not exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted into the otherwise empty hall, which attracted 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later, after the World Cup, between Finland and Ukraine?
Bilbao has 100 Finnish elephants, 80 times as many.
The 1995 European Championship was the golden age of Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian championship at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory would open the door to European cream.
Everything seemed fine.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann has put Möttölä on the calcareous line for the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team went deep.
It is known that a total of just over 100 Finns were present at the Athens Games.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao has reporters, relatives, coaches, but it also has fans.
And there are many.
The phenomenon has grown to unfathomable proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell you the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever number is in between, it's a completely incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for the sports sociologist.
In a global economy, companies are moving across borders.
In sports, we still have a chance to see how we're doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are doing in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, professor of exercise sociology.
Surely, both in Spain and at the World Cup in Poland, there are Finns who are looking for a living.
We shared an experience.
That still doesn't explain everything.
You know, even in sports, you have to have a certain attraction.
I'm crying to make sports a part of popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to a sports show than to Berlin to see art.
But without success, the masses will not be moved.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and the players to make a career of the sport.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team's activities were resumed.
The volleyball guy did the same move a little bit earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Ittonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sport, where the holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
It's a great way to get the audience interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalist advocacy is, Ickonen reminds us.
Can ball sports transfer this massive interest to domestic leagues?
Basketball and volleyball are played to an average of hundreds or slightly over a thousand spectators.
Cryen thinks the question is good, and doesn't necessarily give an answer that promises much good for the species.
The other school believes the interest will shift.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet tooth on a full stomach.
This team is ready for the World Cup, but their basic idea is that they don't care about the domestic series.
It's a challenge to the escorts in the middle of a drug bust.
Botts' property is secured. Nearly three acres on the lake.
Nastola is rewarding formula driver Valtteri Bottacks with a beach house.
The city council unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4 hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
There's a future holiday home on the property.
Nastola has been tracking Bottacks success since his karting days.
He's being touted as a good ambassador to market the Bay, the Bay Area and Nastrola.
The gift box is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkven.
It's been taken over by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate deal.
The area has seven buildings in disrepair, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year at the expense of the municipality.
Bottas won his fourth prize this year at the Belgian Formula One Championship.
He's fifth in the world in points.
Bottas is a native of Nastal and lived in Villähtei as a child.
He lives in England now, but he visits Nastola whenever he has time off from formula.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth hostels.
Design smart clothes are coming, but hardly for the poor.
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis tournament currently underway in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by field ball players, but so is Marcus Giron, one of the top amateur players in college.
He says the shirt helps him track his own progress and regulate his recovery.
The shirt is woven with silver sensors that transmit information to the bag on the shirt and from there to a smartphone or tablet computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The central unit, the mop, is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The company has not given an exact time for the shirt's launch, nor has it hinted at its price, reports Tech Times.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company investing in smart clothing.
Athos from California has brought a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle activity.
The clothes cost $100 each, and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $200.
The Red Orbit also wrote about the Techno-clothing.
A Clever Way to Save on Schoolbooks
College tuition in America costs more than $1,000 for many students, so soon as Matt Schroeder began his second year of college, he came up with a clever way to save money.
He developed a system whereby students in later years would lend their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them on the spot.
"My math book would normally have cost $180, and I paid $10 for it for the whole semester and a sandwich", says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his books last semester would have normally cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but there are many ways for students to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly turning to online shopping and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book for the whole semester at a significantly lower cost than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which has more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rentals last spring, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from on-campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save some money.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
At online bookstores, you can get a new book for only a third of what it would cost at a campus bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but the special-edition book on Chegg.com is $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good alternative if the reader is not distracted by other people's notes and worn-out appearance.
For example, you can buy a used Calculus book at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old senior at Brigham Young University, says that he bought the book Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
A new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, president of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous editions in their course.
Sometimes the revisions of the new edition are not essential to the teaching.
In this case, the old print can be found for only a fraction of the price that would be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after the course.
Renting a book can save you over 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, renting a book of calculus for the whole semester costs about $20.
Read the rules of the rental company, including notes, use of the accent pen, and the cost of the following payments.
Landlord, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
E-books instead of paper books may also be an option.
Sometimes these books are rented, whereby the e-book is paid for by the owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's is offering Calculus as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Brace, many literature students save the most because many classics are now available for free download, whereas books on science and technology can be very expensive.
Whichever option you choose, it is worth comparing different vendors.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine in law school, recommends that you use the ISBN for the price, since it will help you to be sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, says Gault.
He learned it himself from this heel.
The book he had bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book for full price from the university bookstore.
The Legion Theatre in Tampere celebrates 20 years
The theatre, which was founded in 1994, is a fight against unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
Anyone who wants to do performance art is welcome to the event.
To organise a range of leisure activities for the long-term unemployed aged 17 to 35.
The shows often take a stand for society.
In recent years, it has featured such shows as Depressio Moderata, Me Me! - a depressing comedy - humorous narratives about narcissism and classic references.
He believes that every human being can change their own life.
Nearly double the number of people killed in fires last year
This year, almost twice as many people have died in fires as in the previous year.
According to a media report by the Finnish Rescue Service (Spek), 55 people have died in 49 fires so far.
Last year, at the same time, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 over 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the worst was last seen in 2009, when 64 people died in fires by the end of August.
Most fires occur in residential areas.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in private homes, and seven in rowhouses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me to repeat the fire safety of the house.
At least, according to Spek, all the fire alarms in the house should be checked.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing devices are easily accessible.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they may use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport for the anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was called a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had come as far as Belgium.
Youngsters rescued by air from the Australian Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were rescued after a night of being stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a walk after noon on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Relatives worried about the young ones who had not returned home and called the police at two o'clock at night.
A search party of local police and rescuers was sent to find the youngsters, and at about 11 p.m. two were found near Bridal Veil Falls.
She had injured her knee, and he had fallen and hit his head.
The cops spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian troops withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the Luhansk airfield.
The Ukrainian military says the troops were ordered to retreat.
Ukraine says the paratroopers have engaged in a fierce battle with Russian tanks in the field.
The military spokesman said the enemy's artillery was so accurate that it was likely Russian professional soldiers fired at the enemy.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol boat that was hit by artillery fire yesterday in the Sea of Azov off the southeastern coast of Ukraine sank this morning, according to the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Patrol couldn't be sure where the ship was fired from.
The separatists already said on social media yesterday that they shot down the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that at today's Minsk talks, Russia, Ukraine and Ety should agree to an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
He also stressed that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains battered southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic, and buried cars in the ground.
Officials estimated Sunday that it could take time to bring the flood down, although rain was forecast to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no advance weather warnings were given.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the frost that affected the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and fixed.
No wonder it's been so hard to predict.
French Socialists should 'shut up and help France', says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Valls called on the deeply divided left to 'show its feelings' for the troubled socialist president whose new government did not win the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our task is to stay by his side", Valls said, earning applause.
In a soothing gesture, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave the controversial 35-hour workweek in France alone, despite the controversial proposal by new Finance Minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work with the coalition government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused a stir by appearing at a meeting of dissenting socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
The President of the Commission, Mr Le Pen, has been a strong supporter of the European Union and the European Union's efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict.
Francois Hollande may have gone off with a call for war, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last even a summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter", Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve the parliament and said he was confident of his party's victory in the early elections and that he would be ready to lead the party himself.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far right held a key position in the May European elections.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche, a French newspaper published on Sunday, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing factions before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at the university, warned that the French would soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeded in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
'There is little chance of success, but the public must quickly realise that change is taking place', he warned.
Otherwise, it could get worse.
Pokka failed to impress the Finnish presenters Kirsi Alm-Siiran, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recorded portion of the programme.
On Thursday, the Finland program posted a funny video on its Facebook page about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the broadcast of Tomorrow Finland the day after the commercial, but the recording doesn't quite go through.
Alm-Siira is confused when she tries to pronounce the word budgetary strife, and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their tempers again and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to go live tomorrow, says the Facebook update for Tomorrow Finland.
The video has become a huge hit on Facebook, with over 10,000 likes and shares.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, of the magazine's photo office, placed third in a series of portraits in 1972.
This is the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971 at the Master Builders' House on Fredrikskad.
There were many heads of state at the meeting, and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
However, at the beginning of the meeting we were given a good five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four or five meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
I knew right away that this time I had it.
You can tell by the look on his face that Middle Eastern leaders have had a hard time before.
Back then, the competition was about photographing famous people or events.
It's great that nowadays you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén at the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send that to the contest.
Claim: The Aarnio investigation has already paid over EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30 to 50 years of personnel.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in his thesis on computer technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the legal framework for the EU's judicial system.
According to the border, modern technology makes it possible to reuse forensic materials.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence to fill the chain of evidence and at the same time allow for comprehensive legality control.
They're checking the report on Saturday.
General: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken vegetarian"
The image of a special bulletin on the wall of the Women's Travel School in Narkka caused a stir on social media, the newspaper reported on its website.
You vegetarians!
They were fed vegetarian school lunches, fish and chicken.
Only when there's meat on the menu do we make a vegetable alternative!
That's what it says in a 15 year old notice on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image that has spread on social media has caused people to send angry feedback to the City of Pork Fish.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleaning department, tells Yelle that the note left on the wall is not correct and should have been removed some time ago.
It is clear that before I came here there was a time when this idea was discussed with the health care system.
Each student gets a meal according to his wishes, he tells Yale.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are only offered a vegetarian option with parental permission and a doctor's or nurse's certificate of vegetarian nutrition.
The risk justifies the decision to go up on the grounds that young people may be undernourished by vegetarian food experiments and that the absence of meat or chicken may cause students' parents to wonder.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise line, is in talks to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, according to people closely involved.
The sale would give Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalisation of USD 6,8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise lines and wealthy customers as it continues to compete with the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say that information on a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations are not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and a representative of Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the amount of the aid.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, with a total of eight cruise ships, and a itinerary covering Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle classes in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are competing to be the first choice for these new customers when they choose cruising.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
Apollo has owned the majority of the shares in the company since the 2007 transaction, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current form in 2000 after merging with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting's stake in the company was 28%, Apollo's 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP's 8% from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the cruise capacity in North America, according to the registration document published at the time of the Prestige Cruise share issue.
The Tampere City Council is considering the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city council will give its firm support to the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, director of Animal Health, who is preparing a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, the period of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become widespread around the world that keeping advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinarium facilities is not animal-rights or ethically sustainable.
I hope that this view will be echoed in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, notes Tuomivaara.
The threat of doom, the death of the Nassis dolphin, confirms the claims of the undersigned dolphinarium business.
I saw death as a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of Broken Name.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start looking into how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a restricted marine area, a kind of dolphin sanctuary, says the Doomivaara.
This one didn't get to experience a return to the dolphin's original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Strip will get to experience more life than their still concrete pool, says Destruction.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to ban all wildlife in circuses in the upcoming amendment to the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphinarians.
To support this demand, the director of Animal Health, Tuomivaara, will participate in a demonstration for dolphins on September 1st.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will hold a demonstration against the start of the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine on a new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "stateship" of the breakaway region, Russian news sources report.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would have to be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand for the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is consistent with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus effectively force the Ukrainian government to grant independence to the newly proclaimed Novorossiya, allowing it to move towards Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to retake the separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dubbed the region "Novorossiya", "New Russia", a term that recalls the glory days of the Russian Empire before the revolutions.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
'We must start broad negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there', he says.
Peskov said Putin's reference to "statehood" was linked to a broader issue of independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership as it tries to allay fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
The EU is also committed to the implementation of the EU's nuclear programme, which will be implemented in the near future.
The Kremlin representative's interim statement, intended to correct the 'misinterpretation' of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian administration is treating the separatist insurgency in the eastern regions differently from the Crimea, when it effectively seized the region, which has a population of 2 million people, the majority of whom are ethnic Russians.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnic Russians and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, control over the territory that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historic coastal sites.
The Russian territory between Rostov and Crimea also contains mines, factories and metal foundries producing products vital to the Russian military.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislature  after the new elections  consider constitutional amendments to increase the decision-making power of the regions outside the core of Ukraine over their own economic and linguistic status.
But his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and perhaps the armed and ardent separatists in Moscow.
Putin made his latest demands to the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further advances last week after Russian tanks and troops entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the capture of the Russian-backed separatists of the city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to capture the entire strategically important coastal region up to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military fortifications of the city of Mariupol, a steel-producing port city of half a million people located between Novoazovsk and the narrow strip of land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
Mr Poroshenko spoke to EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for further action to prevent Russia's future insults to Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the preparation of additional sanctions to be imposed in the event of a re-emergence of the crisis in Ukraine under uncertain circumstances.
Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 troops moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were besieged by Russia in Ilovaisk were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening goal of Milan was scored by Japanese champion Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari hit first and then Jeremy Menez a little later on a penalty kick.
Lazio also scored a goal in the last minutes of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez defended Antonio Candreva.
Lopez has joined Milan this season from Real Madrid.
Former Milan striker Inzaghi made his debut at the San Siro Stadium with only half a goal.
The match was reported to have a crowd of 39,000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco in the throes of the nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his dismay at the possibility that hackers have stolen his fiancée and nude photos of Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecco.
The entertainment world has been in a state of flux since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted online in the wake of a massive celebrity photo-hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including top models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Michelle Lea, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecco, who lives in Melbourne, have also been reportedly stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grec last month, told Confidential, "This is disgusting".
All personal contact and photos should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and spread.
Grecco, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the case on the website as "shameful" and saying that the victims "feel ashamed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this former boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer with her upper legs uncovered on the edge of a pool.
Palmer's film credits include Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's representative told TMZ that the question was a brazen invasion of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in his tweet: "Publishing stolen photos from a mobile phone is no different from selling a stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost like home and won a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan drug.
Katowice, Poland, was white on Monday: not red-white for the Poles, but blue-white for the Finns.
According to STT, almost 2000 Finnish fans followed Finland's victory at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like we were playing on home turf.
"The fans had such a big impact on our game", Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost the match 0-2, but won the match 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle by six points behind.
Cuba had already led 16-10, but then the Finns got the cheer.
However, the 200-strong Finnish population was disappointed when a charter plane could not land at the airport in Katowice because of heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the game.
Finnish football fans have been conquering Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
The World Cup in Bilbao, Spain, is attended by over 8,000 Finnish fans.
As if every Finnish basket had been the winning basket of the match, the USA star Stephen Curry praised the Finnish basket fans after the match on Saturday.
The board meeting is not being broadcast live due to technical difficulties.
The meeting of the Kouvola City Council cannot be watched live on the Internet today.
According to a press release from the city, the transmission is not possible due to technical problems.
The city of Kouvola regrets the situation.
You can see the recording a couple of days after the meeting.
The meetings of the Kouvola City Council have been available to watch online since the beginning of the year.
The next decision-making session will be live on 13 October 2014.
The videos of the council meeting can be found at http://www.kouvola.fi/index/aakuisvaestolle/paatoksenteko/valtuustoverkossa.html and on the YouTube channel of the city of Kouvola.
