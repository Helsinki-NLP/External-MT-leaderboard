The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass has been announced
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), Andrei Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send no less than 3 thousand new recruits to Donbas.
According to him, in this way Kyiv plans to "at least in some way supplement the units."
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and mass dismissals have led to low staffing levels," said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real number of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv launched the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JF).
This measure was supposed to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas deteriorated due to the assassination of the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described the incident as a terrorist attack.
In the course of the criminal investigation, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian secret services.
US authorities forced Musk to step down as Tesla CEO
US businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of the company he founded, Tesla, at the request of the US authorities.
The entrepreneur will also pay $20 million to settle claims from the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to stay on as Tesla's chief executive.
At the same time, he must pay $20 million and resign as chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to replace him.
It is specified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that he had enough money to buy back shares in the company and sued the entrepreneur.
It is about a businessman's post on Twitter, where he expressed a desire to buy back Tesla shares at $420 apiece, but never did so.
After the tweet, the company's shares rose nearly 11%.
British Foreign Secretary compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of holding member states captive.
The diplomat made this statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Mr Hunt commented on the difficulties of the Brexit negotiations.
What has happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity, "stated the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish the UK for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations were at an impasse.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
Moreover, the question of the Irish border remains open.

The hunting breed Phunsan is from North Korean wolves and received its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which were given to him by former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Dogs are not the only gift.

Head of Altai village council ends hunger strike in defense of residents "interests
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped going hungry for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation has reached an impasse, the district administration does not respond to his demands, and he needs to do his job.
In addition, the Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation into the situation, and the heating organization STPK has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period in the Siberian village next week.
Residents of the village council also prepared and took away to the Governor of Altai Krai a mass collective appeal "concerning the current catastrophic situation."
Boronin himself reported that he felt fine and fulfilled his duties as head during the hunger strike in full.
As Boronin explained, the settlements of Siberian and Rogulichniy have centralized heating systems, which means that the administration of Pervomaysky District must fulfill the authority to prepare them for winter.
So far, however, no one has begun this work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Altai Krai government and against Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk's financial policy.
In addition to properly preparing the villages for winter, Boronin demanded "the immediate establishment of a full-fledged independent section of communal services in the territory of the municipality with appropriate staff units."
New buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments are named
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a value of up to four million roubles were purchased in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of such transactions fell on two LCDs, according to Urbanus portal materials (available to "Lenty.ru").
The leaders in terms of the volume of housing sales in the budget of up to four million roubles were the Nekrasovka residential complex, located beyond the MKAD, in the Kotelniki area (SEVAO), and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibirevo area (SVAO).
Two housing complexes in New Moscow - Yuzhnoe Bunino and Maple Alley - were also notable in the structure of transactions with budget housing.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of transactions with apartments up to four million roubles in these new buildings accounts for 60 percent of all sales and accounts for half of total revenues.
"We should acknowledge the impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles on the commercial success of the Central district in Novye Vatutinki and the Filatov Lug residential complex," the study says about two other residential complexes in New Moscow.
They generate about 35 per cent of financial revenues.
Earlier, the rating of districts of Moscow with the cheapest apartments in new buildings was presented in the real estate agency "Bon Ton."
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per meter) in September 2018 were fixed in SEAO.
The second and third places were taken by WAO and SVAO, with figures of 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with Telegram messenger after the update, released on September 28.
You can find out a user's phone number using their username
The complaints concern gadgets with the latest operating system, iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the app displays a white screen or closes immediately.
Messenger representatives responded to the glitch.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new app written in the language of Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updates to the app until the problems are fixed.
On April 13, the Tagansky Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's request to block Telegram's messenger service in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began enforcing the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data about terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon obtaining a court order.
Telegram audience shrank by 1.2 million after blocking in Russia

Avangard's head coach, Bob Hartley, summed up the KHL regular-season match against Dynamo Minsk (2-1).
A very important victory for us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should put this game behind us and prepare for Minsk.
We knew that Dynamo had a good victory before our meeting, so we prepared very seriously.
It was important to score for the most part, I'm happy for the guys who came out on top.
Lately, we've been playing well in the majority, but we haven't been able to score.
At last, the red light behind the gate has been turned on.
We knew that Minsk would come out charged for the game, try hard, and it turned out that way.
The game for the most part was decisive, we scored the winning goal in unequal compositions.
We managed to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in that stretch and it was clear that it would not be easy going forward.
But we played very well defensively, didn't give many chances to the opponent, didn't allow us to be caught in shifts, Dynamo didn't have attacks with a numerical advantage, so everything ended well for us, "the press service of the Omsk club quotes Hartley as saying.

RBC reports on the imminent resignation of the Governor of Kurgan Region
Governor of Kurgan Region Alexei Kokorin will resign as part of the new rotation of the governor's corps, RBC reports, with reference to two sources close to the presidential administration.
The decision will be officially announced in the near future, the publication notes.

He was elected in September 2014 with 84.87% of the vote.
Prior to the appointment of the acting governor in February 2014, Mr. Kokorin held the post of head of the city of Shadrinsk (Kurgan region).

Elon Musk forced to step down as Tesla CEO
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
CNBC News reports.
According to the channel, as part of the agreement reached, Musk will have to resign as head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to remain in charge of Tesla.
The Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million, according to the report.
Tesla will be charged a similar amount.
At the same time, the money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is among the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the CEO of SpaceX, the neuroscience company Neuralink, the electric car developer Tesla, and the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was set allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture," Bloomberg previously reported, citing the commission's co-director of security, Stephen Peikin.
Meanwhile, Elon Musk has since abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
Meanwhile, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder claimed that the businessman's tweets were misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to purchase securities at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk's careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock market rigging.
Meanwhile, if Musk fails to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he could face removal from the company's board and even jail.
Former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, among others, told CNBC.
Musk is "not a bad guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

The Russian Orthodox Church compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the Church of Russia in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible schism in the Church, and its political implications
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage," renaming the church is like giving "Jews a yellow six-pointed star" in fascist Germany.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this very purpose," a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on Rossiya 24 television channel.
The Metropolitan also emphasized that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because "the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."
UOC called on Constantinople exarchates to leave its territory
Sochi Grand Prix: full house, Russian car and Kvyat's return
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak summarizing the results of a meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared his opinion on Daniil Kvyat's return to Toro Rosso and estimated the attendance of the Russian Formula One stage.
The result of our meeting with the automakers should be precisely the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car in the foreseeable future, which has no analogues in the world, stated Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
We talked about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible at this time.
I think a more realistic timetable is within the next ten years. "
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team competed in Formula One under a Russian license.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the World Cup in motor racing in the class "Formula 1."
I know that there are fans of motor sports in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of a Russian Formula One team, "he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have such a team.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came about partly because such infrastructure appeared in Sochi. "
Tomorrow, Sochi Avtodrom will be sold out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even in qualifying, the rostrum was almost full, "noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that this year's revenue grew by 72% compared to the previous year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of Sochi Avtodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not avoid the main theme of the day for Russian fans of motorsport: the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to Izvestia.
He is a promising rider.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian drivers will be able to take part in the Formula One peloton at once.
Although the fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal Race" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and the results so far have not been impressive: he finished 18th in qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - Dmitry Kozak stated.

"Golden Pearl" for "ultimate realism"
For the third time in its history, the San Sebastián International Film Festival has recognized a Spanish film as the best film of the year.
The main award, "The Golden Shell," was awarded to the drama "Between the Two Seas," directed by Isaki Lacuesta.

The film was the directorial debut of Swedish actress Tuva Novotna.
In the category "Best Screenplay," the victory was shared by the films "Julia" and "Faithful Man."
The Philippine crime drama "Alpha: The Right to Murder" received a special jury prize.
Dizziness, tears and laughter
The San Sebastián festival is called one of the main cultural events in Spain and one of the most important European film competitions.
Director Isaki Lacuesta told Euronews about his impressions of the festival:
It was wonderful!
We came here as a team and of course we experienced dizzying moments, tears, laughter.
We're happy.
We started making this film 14 years ago, it was a very long work and, most importantly for me, we didn't want to stop.
Now is the time for joy and gratitude.
As Euronews correspondent Carlos Marlasca notes, Isaki Lacuesta's film fits seamlessly into the collection of films that received the Golden Shell, "but the San Sebastian festival did not come without unexpected, sometimes shocking, jury decisions, which are sometimes even called the calling card of the competition."

Russian President Vladimir Putin spent Saturday relaxing in the Khakassia taiga.
The Russian leader's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists this on Sunday, September 30.
In Khakassia, Putin stopped on his way from Dushanbe, where a summit of CIS leaders was held on Friday.

Basta shamed Rostov fans
Russian musician Vasily Vakulenko, who plays under the pseudonym Basta, addressed the fans of FC Rostov during his concert at the local arena.
His words are reported by Rostovgazeta.ru.
Why are we so hypocritical and rejoice only in success?
Where were you all when the club was in a terrible position?
Everyone thought of a great club again only when things got better.
But let's also talk about other football teams in Rostov, "Basta said.
The musician's concert took place on September 29.
On the same day, there were indications that the Rostov Arena pitch suffered because of the protective covering that was being installed before the rapper's performance.
The football club "Rostov," as well as the leadership of the Russian Premier League (RPL) reacted negatively to the holding of a music concert at the Rostov stadium.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin ushered in the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame, and made him a Nobel laureate.
Incidentally, the release of penicillin from mold fungi was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, having caught a cold, he had sown mucus from his own nose on a petri dish (a glass cover in which bacteria are experimented with), and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been eliminated.
Almost by accident, he discovered penicillin.
Fleming's name has been added to the list of 100 greatest personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the most ancient diseases that had hitherto been considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after winning the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France."
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.

Trump talks about 'falling in love' with Kim Jong-un
The leaders of the US and North Korea have gone from mutual brutality to almost falling in love with each other, Donald Trump has joked.
US President Donald Trump famously joked about his successes on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the two leaders have now mended their relationship to the point that they are almost in love with each other, the US president said.
The White House host recalled that he accepted the North Korea issue from the previous administration as a major foreign policy challenge.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had become so mired in relations with North Korea that they couldn't even call the country's leaders - they simply didn't take the phone down.
Back then, the US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and now the North Korean leader is writing "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that he, too, was "cruel" to Kim Jong-un at the start of his tenure, but that it was reciprocal.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders have "fallen in love with each other."
Trump, however, asked not to take his words literally and warned that the US media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and is closing military test sites.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is convinced.
Donald Trump lavished praise on Kim Jong-un from the podium of the United Nations General Assembly last Tuesday.
Trump praised the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Trump has indicated that sanctions against North Korea will remain in place until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.

Positive outcomes of the meeting were the cessation of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps toward North Korea's denuclearization have stalled.
Media reported that the US had already sent North Korea several disarmament scenarios after the Singapore summit, but Pyongyang dismissed them as "gangster."

Nice urged to supplant "the Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and campaigner for the purity of her native language Larisa Nitsoy called for "the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language" to be displaced from Ukraine.
She suggests doing so with a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsa shared her thoughts on "the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of the Observer.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is currently being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech used to be widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it has practically disappeared.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nitsa shared her experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue bookstore chain Watsons, one of which had a cashier communicate with her in Russian.
Having failed to achieve her goal, Nitzoy threw a delivery at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia," urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the spelling of their surnames.
She recently claimed that the name "Rus" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called "Moskovia."
Even the Security Service of Ukraine could not escape the writer's anger: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left by slamming the door.

'You've missed a few matches because of the injury you suffered at the start of the month.
How did it feel today? "
"If he withstood 90 minutes, then everything is good!
In fact, it felt good.
Maybe at the end it takes a bit of strength not to let anything happen.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What can you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It is no secret to anyone that it is easier to recover after victories, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white band, although at first it was black.
It is necessary to continue in the same spirit and to please fans. "
"Did you miss the game during the time that you didn't go out on the field?"
"There is something, a little bit bored, because really, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary. "

This view was expressed by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem in an interview with RT TV, which aired on Sunday.

Charge for Dagestan MP is news
The Sovetsky District Court of Makhachkala detained Rajab Abdulatipov, a deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, for two months, suspected of participating in a criminal association that issued disability certificates for bribes.
Kommersant has learned details of the investigation, which shed light on how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, facilitated the criminal activities of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Makhachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of operational searches conducted by the Ministry of the Interior, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, ostensibly receiving 70 million roubles for doing so.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev and other heads and employees of the territorial medical and social expertise bureaus under his subordination resulted in a criminal case under Article 210 (establishment of a criminal association using official position and participation therein), Article 290 (taking a bribe by an organized group), Article 292 (forgery), and Article 159 (fraud on a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the investigation materials, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of Pension Fund funds, joined their activities by joining a criminal association.
While serving as the head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having connections with state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as taking advantage of his relationship with the head of Dagestan, investigators believe, Rajab Abdulatipov "provided for the activities of other members of the criminal association, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support Magomed Makhachev's illegal activities and his tenure as head of the federal state-owned institution, the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan," and organized the illegal establishment of disabilities for citizens. "
After the announcement of this information at a session of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being charged against me today is new to me, I am completely unfamiliar with it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months, because his case involves Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, investigators have much more time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent
Konstantin Kosachev, Head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly a success for Russia and does not rule out that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an indispensable participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have become almost accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia has now been much more muted," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, Russia had sometimes "been identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, one alongside Ebola, the other alongside climate change or terrorism, at least in the narrative of a group of Western countries, which has expressed itself fairly unanimously on this issue."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the chorus was not exactly accurate," the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer some kind of wall against which tennis balls are trained."
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend that, in his opinion, "will single out the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although the full extent of this trend may become apparent in a year, two, three years from now."
"I do not rule out that the current session could in some sense be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how, with Russia's involvement, it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that Russia's vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due, he believes, to the emergence of "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possibility, but an indispensable participant in solving the global problems of our time."
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere near a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a backward movement, it will be a forward movement," he added.
Kosachev called another "interesting and important feeling" in this context "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [to the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if only a year or two or five years ago no one was interested in Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different," stated the Chairman of the Security Council Committee.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order personified with the West has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration."
"Here, too, the demand for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers "this session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus says it has the right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, said Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem.
At the same time, according to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of fighters from the Jabhat al-Nusra organization, which is banned in Russia, from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in the event of Kurdish aspirations for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they broke down because of the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry was in charge of Chelsea's youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was in talks about a move to Spartak Moscow.
Former England captain John Terry has taken charge of Chelsea's youth team, RT reports, citing the Mirror.
According to the source, the well-known player, a long-time member of the London club, will lead the team no older than 23 years.
It is noted that in the coaching staff, Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
Recall that in September, Terry was close to a move to Spartak Moscow, but eventually abandoned the idea after speaking to his family.
Irina Gerashchenko, First Deputy Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who had been convicted of "espionage" in the Russian Federation, for the fact that he had not yet been released from prison.
She said this in a video message to the political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, these days, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, the participants of which have announced a hunger protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, and artists, including people who know you well, go on hunger strike to support Oleg Sentsov, other Kremlin political prisoners, and, of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to exert pressure on the Kremlin, to exert pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all-political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea, "Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will temper every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil."
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016, at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage against the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict.
Russian jailers granted the Ukrainian's last request before his transfer to the colony.

Two Japanese rovers (planetary walkers) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to produce unique images.
The damage to the 2018 World Cup stadium's football lawn was attributed to Basta
Damage to the football lawn at the stadium in Rostov-on-Don was linked to a concert by the Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.

The Rostov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those Rostov players and representatives who claim that my speech could cause damage, interfere with the activities and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players," Basta wrote in response to the criticism.
Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums for the 2018 World Cup.
It hosted five matches of the tournament.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists tell about how they managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and popular people's stories of beating cancer offer hope to many sufferers.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was only alive thanks to his wife.
Years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a verdict.
"It was as if I had been hit in the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
Disoriented.
They put him in hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon there, I couldn't stand up, I was falling all the time.
They started to do tests, it turned out that things were bad, the artery didn't pass blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they told me that I had a large purulent cyst in my head and urgently had surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor, "Kikabidze said in the program" Once. "
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Back then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to their idol on his doorstep.
But the actor's wife did not allow the living actor to be buried, she sincerely believed that she would be able to cope with the illness and did not leave her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive today.
Whenever I had a crisis, she was there like a rock, "the actor admitted.
The actor managed to overcome the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, rumors about his illness and untimely death appear on the web.
The creators of the "Peacemaker" site have introduced Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto into the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "an infringement on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the head of the Foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was found guilty of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine," as well as participation in "the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian law by citizens."
It should be noted that in front of Szijjarto, the viceroy of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Pavel, and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Onufry, met in "Purgatory."
The reason was their opposition to Tomos being received by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to Yuri Agibalov, Deputy Governor of the Voronezh Region, was made on the basis of the regional law "On public offices."
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" released from the post of acting official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, Agibalov's current salary is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the press service emphasized, the size of the one-time payment amounted to 223,892 roubles net of income tax, not 1 million roubles, as reported by the media.
The official has been receiving an old-age pension since July 2018.
He has held public office for more than nine years.
Assignment to him of this pension and one-time payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, the regional government explained to RIA Novosti news agency.
At the same time, Agibalov's pension supplement was suspended when he was appointed to a state post, and the size of his salary remained unchanged compared to the previous period.
Alexander Gusev, who won the election of the region's acting governor, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was relieved of his post in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, other officials who have held public office in the region have ended their terms of office.
On September 29, Telegram-channel "Nezygar" published documents, from which it emerged that Agibalov, who resigned from the post of vice-governor, was paid severance pay in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later he again received a similar post without the prefix "acting."
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are attracted to masturbation by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Moscow Speaks radio station:
As part of general sex education for children, this should be done by explaining the harm, because there is a definite risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that children mature early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the possibility of official intersex contact.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is impeded by "bigotry," the suppression of "problems of sexual age," and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face onanism.
The deputy believes that it is primarily in schools in "hyper-urbanized" regions that lessons about the dangers of onism should be taught.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood, to put it mildly," the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is a current academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honoured doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Public Organization "National Health League."

The AfD has become Germany's second most popular party
The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans are beginning to get seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policies, which have made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Nowhere is this clearer than in recent opinion polls, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party is growing in popularity and the positions of Merkel's ruling bloc and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the popular vote.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent popularity, managed to overtake the Social Democrats, which have about 16 percent.
The one-percentage-point gap can be attributed to statistical error, but the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of euroskeptic economists, has become a serious political force.
The governing CSU / CDU bloc still holds the overall lead, with around 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for a fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percentage points from last year.
Add that the Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and the Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative für Deutschland) party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which includes people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially focused only on economic issues, including the euro and EU engagement.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the deutsche mark and a full exit from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepens, the AfD's political platform has broadened.
In 2013, the group emerged as a full-fledged party, occupying a Euroskeptic niche and harshly criticizing the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AfD made its way into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative für Deutschland win seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling the citizens of Ukraine a "nation of bullies" has been published
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted live on air that he considers his compatriots "a nation of bullies."
They believe in television and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"Since childhood, we have not been instilled with a culture of reading and accepting texts," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lacking patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began to fight literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car in case of an apocalypse - Driving magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defense Solutions said it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armor
It is not just video game makers, movie studios, and book publishers that are making money on the subject of the apocalypse.
Now automobile companies are also exploring a new niche for themselves.
For example, Canada's Roshel Defense Solutions unveiled its Apocalypse Armored Vehicle Senator APC.
In their spare time, the company's engineers create armored vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are accommodated in an all-welded armor capsule without much comfort but in complete safety.
This bunker, otherwise you can't call the structure, because its booking level is in accordance with the B7 standard, is mounted on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its underside, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle saloon
In order for passengers not to be harmed by even an explosive wave from a shell that exploded next to the car, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has a self-contained ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For a safe view, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular view camera system with night vision function, as well as an armored observation tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
The front of the Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower 6.7-litre turbodiesel engine, the full power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
No chance of getting stuck in the armored vehicle of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse
You can see the armored vehicle of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will take place in October.
The Time of Death of the Universe Is Named
The universe will last about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observable world of about 13.8 billion years.
The study by an international team of scientists has been posted in the electronic preprint library of arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to this conclusion by observing about ten million galaxies using the Subaru telescope's HSC (Hyper Prime-Cam) camera.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists using the standard cosmological model, Cold Dark Matter, estimated the rate of expansion of the universe to be slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru observatory said in a press release that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and data from the European Planck space telescope clarified the limitations imposed on CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible demise of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented a new argument that the observable world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Disconnect.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
Opportunity to hear people's views on pension reform postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the all-federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, which registered different wording of the questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five wording).
They decided to appeal to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Are you in favor of not raising the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens are entitled to receive an old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legally capacious.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Just Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh, and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and had no plans to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: Admiral created big problems for us
Head coach of Ak Barsa Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the KHL regular season match against Admiral (4-2).
'It wasn't an easy game, it was difficult.
The rival fought with dignity and created big problems for us.

In the Loko-Akhmat match, Turbin's mistakes fell like a cornucopia
Former All-Union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the 9th round match of the Russian championship "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and reviewed the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the Lokomotiv v v Akhmat match?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unsuitability to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo," neither Turbin himself nor the leaders of the DSI drew serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was immediate in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, frequent misses of rough receptions, were spilling out of the cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railroad worker Eder is knocked down with his hands in his penalty area by defender "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight metres from goal, but Turbin doesn't take a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idowu, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball had hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was next to the moment, clearly seeing the episode and his first assistant on the right.
Reserve referee Sergei Karasev should have seen this as well.
All three, however, fell asleep and no penalty was awarded.
So the score in the match was skewed and sporting justice was trampled on.
It was a case where the concept of refereeing superseded and buried the spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the visitors, Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he applauded him demonstratively.
What do you think about this episode?
Did I have to show a second "mustard"?
- At this point Turbin also showed the first yellow card not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams are awarded penalties for such violations as in the Idowu episode, and some are not.
What do you think of a footballer's words?
- Looking at what is meant by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So the referee doesn't give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
That is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee looks at who is playing.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and Akhmat has serious complaints about Turbin's performance because the team was disadvantaged.
Matt Damon plays accused rapist Judge Kavanaugh on SNL
American actor Matt Damon played US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared on the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small skit, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The US Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention for his emotional and detailed stories in a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly professed his love of beer, but has said he has never drunk to the point of oblivion.
Kavanaugh also claimed to be a virgin in an attempt to plead not guilty to a rape charge.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows it, "the judge, played by Matt Damon, said.
Earlier, Kavanaugh was elected chief justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand reveals bizarre behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand has claimed that clones of her dead dog behave very differently from the original pet.
'They're not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul, "the 76-year-old singer said.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Toolear dog, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was named the smallest dog in the world, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning the six-year-old animal in a bid to understand why it is so miniature.
US mulls naval blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies
The US may launch a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so zealously engaged in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The possibility of a naval blockade was discussed yesterday by US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
So Zinke's statement fell entirely within the purview of his office, though it was not devoid of political overtones.
Speaking at an industry event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said the US Navy controls shipping lanes in the Middle East and can block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need may stem from Washington's desire to disrupt Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activism in the region, Zinke is convinced.
The minister made it clear that the US still expects to secure its leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to supplant Russia and Iran, and a sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke said.

Supersonic passenger planes to be put on mass production in Russia
Mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by Kirill Sypalo, Director General of the Central Aerodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky.
According to him, the research center works on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

In Russia, there is a club that I follow
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry on why he attended Spartak's match against Rostov (0-1) in the ninth round of the Russian Championship.
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I have been watching quite recently and it was interesting to look at it from the outside.
I cannot say that I am a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision, "the website of Chelsea fans quotes Terry as saying.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and "Spartak" was placed in fifth place, with 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, on October 7, red and white will play against "Yenisei," and Valery Karpin's men will take on "Orenburg" the previous day.
Expensive violin was handed over to a pawnshop for a fraction of the price
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnbroker offered just $50 for what looked like an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool and sought expert advice.
Here it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Ties to the violin alone are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he is not registered for any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, a fascinating confrontation awaits us: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man, as we know, no stranger to the "people's team."
The special piquancy of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3rd and 4th place in the standings, falling behind the far-off Zenit and being one point behind Krasnodar, which plays Dynamo tomorrow.
The red-and-white strip is now a difficult one: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly took on Rapida in the Europa League, and recently lost at home to Ahmat.
After the derby with CSKA ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat Chernomorets with minimal score and not without difficulty in the Chernomorets Cup, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club has come close to overcoming the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but it knows no defeats for five matches already.
It remains to be seen whether Karpin will be able to extend his winless streak with such a crucial match.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky Rostov with Spartak ended in favor of the capital team.
Kick-off is at 19: 00.
Indonesia rocked by aftershocks after massive tsunami

The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, Rossiya 24 TV reported.
The death toll exceeded 420, and more than 500 people were injured.
Authorities warned people of the tsunami threat in advance, but later canceled it.
The fact is that the instruments did not detect the approach of the wave.
The fate of dozens of other residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the embankments of Palu, the city most devastated by the disaster, is still unknown.
London erupts with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But Britain will stand up for its values, he stressed during a speech to the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
Threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are operating in grey areas through cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt referred to the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury last March of ex-GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a name change.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic Northern Macedonia, was one of the first to vote.
Preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
Jan Petersen, Head of the Observation Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews about the organization of the observers "work:
Approximately 100 teams travelled across the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the compilation of protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country to monitor the preparations for voting, the work of the media, compliance with the law on campaign finance and the organization of the referendum.
Fay Dulgheri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting process.
The observer teams record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions, who then present them in a final report. "
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them are not very important for mutual understanding.
This was reported on International Interpreter Day, September 30, by professional interpreter and synchronizer Barbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to plan events calmly, and Russians, as the saying goes," take a long time, and go quickly. "
But it seems to me that this does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between nations and for the interpreter's work, "the specialist said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, it is "enough to know history" to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other.
And in the future, Sachs noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny, "she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to "establish and maintain relations" with Russia.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin mania.

Russians Donate One Rouble for Low-Wage Deputies
In Yekaterinburg, the Human Foundation opened a fund-raising for State Duma deputy Vera Ganzi, who complained about her low salary.
The progress of the campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
"The Human Charitable Foundation expresses the hope that we will be able to save the servant of the people all over the world.

Comedy "Evening School" tops US box office
The comedy "Evening School," which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its first weekend in theaters.
Such a result allowed an unpretentious picture starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office for September 28-30.
In the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million, including $2 million from British audiences.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, remarkably, quite significantly outperformed another newcomer to Western distribution - the cartoon "Smallfoot," a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a member of the human race, the existence of which the protagonist never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig, grossed $23 million in its opening weekend, broadly meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the film would take in $20-25 million over the weekend.
As for Smallfoot's total takings, they currently amount to $38.6 million (it has already made its debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active, adding $3.6 million to the film's coffers.
The top three this time were closed by the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Clock" from the master of horrors Elay Roth, who finally proved that the director knows how to make high-quality films for the audience 12 + as well.
In its second week at the box office, John Bellaire's adaptation of Jack Black's charming book with Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.8 million.
Despite dropping out of the top 3, the "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple Request" continues to surprise with a "+" sign: in 17 days in the US box office, the film by Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were initially not expected from the word "at all," has collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million total revenue.
Last in the top five this week was horror "The Curse of the Nun," which grossed $5.4 million during the reporting period.
The spin-off "Spellings" has grossed $330 million in 24 days in US (and not just, of course) theaters, and has recently proudly been named the franchise's most successful film, which also includes two parts of "Spellbound" itself and two films about the spooky doll Annabelle.
Just behind Corin Hardy's horror at the end of last weekend is another representative of the genre - the debutant Hallfest, one of the main youth horror films of the year.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of renowned montage (and more recently director) Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including "Happy Death Day," to which Hallfest bears a strong resemblance in places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is overwhelmingly positive.
Seventh was "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which does not seem to be thinking about dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, now in its seventh week on screens, is the sixth highest-grossing film of the genre ever, with $165.7 million at the end of September.
This is the amount that the film has now earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the film is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky ones who made it into the top ten in the US for September 28-30, they were "Predator," "White Guy Rick" and... "Crimson Mint," which earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
It should be added that next weekend in the United States the long-awaited "Vienna" with Tom Hardy will be fully assembled, which - of this one can be certain - will take the lead in the American boxing office without much difficulty following the results of the first weekend in October.
Other premieres in the coming week include Bradley Cooper's musical melodrama A Star Is Born, the Venice Film Festival winner, and the crime drama Your Hatred.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
Vityaz head coach Valery Belov on the defeat by Siberia (3-4) in the KHL regular season match.
"A colleague was talking about Siberia fans, and I want to mention our fans," Belov was quoted as saying by Vityaz's official website.
"I hope they will support as well, because now almost every game there is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
Probably, God helped Siberia in the game today, because our leaders were very grossly mistaken.

Compared to last match, it was a different team. "
"This is ugly nepotism"
Viewers outraged by Agutin's choice on The Voice
Viewers of the show "The Voice 60 +" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud."
When, in the blind auditions, he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he chose a relative for his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor for his lack of objectivity at first.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father unjustifiably took the place of the more deserving performers.
And now viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.
Yesterday, we viewers of the show were outraged at nepotism by the ugly and blatant way in which our close relatives were dragged down the final flight of stairs.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag his father to the very first place, "Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program" Man from TV. "
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of" The Voice "from Agutin's team - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to prove himself as a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad, who does not sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?,"
"Like how the pope sings, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
This is The Voice, not Cool Relatives.
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part."
'Then you have to ask your dad to appear on your own show, not on a show that's made for Channel 1 money. '
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut, with his splendid voice and timbre, drained, while Agutin's father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and screen for decades!
Because you can't break through nepotism! "
"What did you expect?
This is Russia!
Blat and cronyism are everywhere.
And money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of the absurd continues! "
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice," Gradsky's son appeared at the blind auditions.
It never occurred to Meter then to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, come from here, everything is clear."
Agutin couldn't act like a professional.

The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudri Street, law enforcement officials in the capital reported.
According to the victim, an unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly pulled out a knife and demanded money and a mobile phone.
As the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the money to be withdrawn from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnias and a phone, he hit the victim and fled, "the statement reads.
Law enforcement officers managed to apprehend the robber, who turned out to be a 25-year-old from Kyiv.
He now faces up to seven years in prison.
Police are also working on a theory of the attacker's involvement in other similar crimes.
Recall that on the eve of several high-profile robberies of cash collectors took place in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught by a drone.
The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the Russian Federation's expedition to the Moon
Anatoly Petrukovich, Head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told RIA Novosti about a possible research program for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now engaged in developing areas of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option would be to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic sources of radio emissions," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be involved in the search for primitive organic matter on Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos Corporation said that, in an optimistic scenario, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
The offended customer dumped a basket of faeces at the 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, allegedly "had a tooth" on the manager of the 7-Eleven chain's 24-hour store, who kicked him out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past midnight, he entered the store and dropped the contents of the basket on the floor and some of the goods on the shelves.
The basket contained faeces and urine that Simms had "borrowed" from a nearby mobile toilet.
When police arrived on the scene, they arrested the "avenger."
He was jailed and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal trespassing, and banned from entering the store or approaching the manager.
Although Simms's crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the sentence could be quite severe, as he has repeatedly broken the law before: he is charged with grand larceny, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, driving under the influence, and animal cruelty.

The United States announced a possible naval blockade of Russia
The United States could, if necessary, impose a naval blockade on Russia to prevent it from supplying energy to the Middle East.
This was stated by US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the agency said that the only source of income for the Russian economy is the sale of energy resources, and Moscow pursues an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes the Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the same is true of Iran.
According to the Minister, there are two variants of events to solve this problem: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use it first, so pressure must be brought to bear to displace Iran's energy resources.

I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
Russian Williams driver Sergei Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
'Honestly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start and at the second corner I was caught between two cars, which immediately squeezed me.
I lost all the positions I had won at the start, the moment, immediately.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of the pit stop, we would get in the "clean air" and the pace would return, but there was no rubber.
Plus I struggled with my partner, there was contact with him, too.
As I understand it, he was a bit mistaken.
We were in this situation on the slowest track of the season, there was nothing I could do and it was very painful to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore, "RIA Novosti quotes Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race for the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the basis of Spartacus absurd
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR), Shamil Tarpischev, commented on the dismissal of Spartak Moscow players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko from training with the main squad after liking the criticism of the head coach of the team, Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport Weekend."
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It is folly to pay attention to such things.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the rift in the team.
First, these are poems, which can be read and received as one pleases.
I wouldn't have reacted to it at Carrera's place.
Everyone, after all, has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko post likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility.
And it does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today "Spartak" does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be hyped at all.
Maybe it was just worth having a laugh about it together.
Spartak have a lot of things wrong with different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction into the youth set-up.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match, "Tarpischev is sure.
The game between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19: 00 Moscow time.
Earlier, John Terry, who had turned down Spartak, was in charge of Chelsea's youth team.
Pupils of Sirius discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi, members of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the Kurchatov Institute, a national research centre.
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the educational center's website on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kurchatov's Codes," during which Mikhail Kovalchuk, President of the Kurchatov Institute and Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, spoke about global challenges as a driving force of civilization development.
The scientist's lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Pupils learned that modern technologies require a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to generate such volumes.
According to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies, which young scientists are currently working on, will help to solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as spoke about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, a colossal boon.
It is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is, in fact, the technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is the flip side - purposeful interference in a person's life.
There are always risks.
A car appeared and people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, "REN TV quotes the scientist as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were Yuliya Dyakova, Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS-like technologies at the Kurchatov Institute Research Center, and Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS-technologies.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the All-Russian online Olympiad on Information Security "Cyber Call" will be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: Referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "Northern Macedonia."
Greece objected to Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic an opening to NATO and later to the EU.
But only 34% of the turnout in Sunday's plebiscite "fell short" of the constitutional threshold of 50%, the EFE news agency reports.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to change the name.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a proponent of changing the name of the republic, said that if there was a greater "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the failure to reach a quorum.

Kemerovo residents outraged by flock of sheep in cemetery
On September 30, a message appeared on the well-known Kemerovo social network page from an eyewitness that horned animals walk freely in one of the local cemeteries.
The animals, in large herds, walked between the fences and plucked out the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some locals noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help to clear the area of weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the city did not like the behavior of the animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing the sheep can do there.
Of course, you can't say that the sheep are blasphemous, but still it's not the matter. "(The style is preserved) - the indignant resident of Kemerovo noted in her message.
In any case, some eyewitnesses pointed out that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
To press and to press - how is it right?
There is no word on pressure.
The right thing to do is to dominate.
The word "pressure" in the sense of "gravitate, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "dominate."
We use this word because we believe that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "domination" are not only not close, but even in some ways opposite.
See for yourself.
To be attracted (church-bookish, obsolete) means "enough, enough, enough, enough for someone or something, enough to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure - kindred words.
It used to have the meaning of "not depending on anything, to be self-sufficient" - "to be self-sufficient."
The Old Slavonic "dovety" is related to the words "command" and "will."
To press, to suppress - is completely different.
These words have truly terrifying "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress."
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "pressure," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, have forced them into contagion.
So we have this very "e" that is used in writing through "a," which is, well, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
So, the right thing to do is to dominate.
But the word is obsolete, no longer in its proper meaning.
If you want to point out that some circumstances / people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word "pressure."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember this is a chancellorship.

Readers asked the journalist, if she could find out who the author of the idea was, to tell them about it.
After all, this man seems to be somewhere nearby: he has watched the baby park more than once, once such a thing occurred to him.

The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has ordered that the highest alert level for the armed forces of the country be maintained because of the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The president has ordered that the highest level of combat readiness be maintained, and a separate order will be issued to cancel it," Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin said Sunday, as quoted by TASS.

Russia has shielded itself from terrorists with the help of the operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85,000 of whom were killed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was told by Viktor Bondarev, former Commander-in-Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces and head of the Defence and Security Committee of the Federation Council, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria.
He noted the high precision of the use of weapons from the air: Aerospace forces have carried out, and continue to carry out, all attacks precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years - for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists "defenses were cracked - a decisive contribution to the advance of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom held Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries were fighting on the side of the IS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about registered persons, not including those who have not been identified, Bondaryev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondaryev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise, this evil "would flood to us."

Syria accuses US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it has targeted, and it has massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law, "he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided "direct support to the terrorists," as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in their path."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Moallem added that Damascus also intends to purge Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kyiv's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Church of Russia in Ukraine to the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is like pointing a yellow pointed star at a Jew in fascist Germany, it means labeling the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this very purpose," stated the Metropolitan on the Rossiya-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
In this way, Kyiv hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "outlaw it," the cleric believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier, it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada were working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

The viceroy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian sacred sites
Metropolitan Vladimir, Viceroy of the Holy Dormition Lavra of Pochaev, made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy places.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
At various times in history, our predecessors and fellow Christians have had to profess their faith and defend their holy places.
Taking into account the situation that has developed, and according to the information we have and the death threats that are being disseminated, it is clear that we will have to go through something, "stated the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The vicar of the Lavra also stressed that "your physical presence will probably be needed."
The cleric added: "Lenin's grandchildren are spiritually threatening to kill, so we will protect our shrine."
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be prepared to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has canonical status, determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
Now someone wants to make Pope Bartholomew dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has, "noted the vicar of the Lavra.
He reminded that the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need? "noted Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican?
To some extent, believers understood and decided which church they should go to.
But some want to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes on the temples they want to demolish are shining, "the priest emphasized.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of Pochaevskaya Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

I liked the first period very much.
We didn't take advantage of a few good moments.
In the second period the opponent pressed us a little, we stood up.
But we were a bit "fed up."
The guys played great, did the coaching set-up.
I think if we continue to play as well, wins will come.
We didn't score, we didn't win games with zero goals, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction. "
"In your opinion," Motorist "added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"

During the pre-season, the teams were solving other problems, a lot of young guys were playing.
I think it was a completely different game, a different hockey.
"Motorist" is a good quality team.
It is clear from the standings that the team is playing the right way.
Good hockey, a good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
A good defence, a good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew that the team was going without defeats, we wanted to break it, but it didn't work out. "

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, September 30, there is a referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mickoski, has declared that he will not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mickoski decided to abstain from the vote in order to express his opposition to the treaty, which he considers "harmful."
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the question of renaming the country, and nothing more, whereas the party's strategic goal is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also withdrew from the September 30 referendum.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," Ivanov noted.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 of this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which straddles the border between the two countries.
The treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute over the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.

US pleases with rise in opiate production in Afghanistan
Much was said in Tehran on September 26 about the sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants have unleashed a veritable terrorist war against the state authorities and the country's civilian population.
This year has been a record year in terms of the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans have died, "Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's woes did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the US was declared the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), which had settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and its NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have passed.
Many thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peace is even more elusive than it was then.
American troops have been herded behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money - just so that they are not touched.
Afghanistan's government controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% went to ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing rapidly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with this.
How fitting that, during the 17 years of American presence, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40-fold.
A huge increase in opium poppy cultivation and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, provided the country's name is changed.
The agreement to change the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attack on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia has the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will assert its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot please everyone. "
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, favor renaming the country.
Against is the conservative opposition and the country's president, Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it makes no sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First and foremost, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
Fay Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonia's citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole. "
