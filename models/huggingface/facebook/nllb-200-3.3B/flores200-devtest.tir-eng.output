A discovery published Thursday has led to the creation of new species of ivy in Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, have found that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although some, including Darwin, Finch, and GeoSpiza Conchrist, believe it will take longer.
gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes. it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be tied to a rope, twisted, or even lost. It can also be wrapped as a short string.
It is very flexible, and can be bonded to other metals. Because of its high flexibility, it is sometimes used in the hand-painted illustrations of so-called "illuminated" books.
This is called the pH (acidity) of a chemical. A standard can be made from a solution of red clover.
The solid of kaolu changes color as an acid or a basic (alkali) chemical.
pH is measured by the hydrogen pH (Hb pH).
The hydrogen ions have protons that fill their electrons to form a nucleus (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).

In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also baths. In the Roman Empire, the bathroom was sometimes the public bathroom, where men and women bathed together.
you use a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space sends a signal that instantly reverses.
The satellite rocket is launched into space. Because the Earth's atmosphere detects some of our light and perspective, scientists use space telescopes.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket with a range of over 100 meters is required.
The wheel has changed the world in a remarkable way. The greatest thing it has done for us is make transportation easier and faster.
We also have trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
beneath them are the mid-sized, prey-eating mantis, ranging from the mantis to the antelope and the rube.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the red fox) that eat many small prey, such as cockroaches, the red fox, and birds.
The secret of their success is that each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
The lion cubs are the most social species of the cat.
The lion family consists of up to three related male lions with thirty female and male lion cubs.
The women are often members of a large family with brothers and children, and are close to each other.
Lions have a characteristic similar to that of wolves or lions. Unsurprisingly, like lions (unlike other large mammals), they are extremely aggressive when hunting.
The all-round athlete can kick a tiger (not much for you), jump, jump long distances, and pull five times as much as a strong man.
The tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar are all in the same group (genus Panthera). These four are the only animals that can be heard.
The tiger's mane is not as full as the lion's mane, but is as full-thinking as the leopard's, the elephant's.
The tiger prefers to eat small animals. If it can, it will catch a lizard, a snake, a lizard, and a bird. The tiger chases them, but all are smaller than it by the knee.
Scientists think that Oselote tracks the animals and feeds them at night and then pours them into the ground where they live.
The cat is also a very aggressive predator, and it is not uncommon for its prey to be seen in the dark. The cat is also a predator of the snow leopard, which is a species of mammal that is known to be aggressive.
When a few species (a small population) are separated from their original inhabitants (either by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island so as not to be easily returned), they often encounter a different climate from that which they were previously exposed to.
The new climate has different resources and different competitors, so the new settlers need different forms or adaptations to be more competitive than they have been in the past.
The original settlers never changed, and they still need to be changed.
over time, as the new residents begin to adjust to their new surroundings, they become more and more like the other settlers.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, these two men will look so different that they cannot possibly be called one.
The process is called speciation, which means the creation of new seeds. Specifications are an inevitable opportunity, and a very useful part of the evolutionary process.
plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe in.
plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. it also provides shade.
We make houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant food. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was the most famous hunter of its time, and feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws, with teeth measuring over 70 centimeters long and with additional teeth at the roof of its mouth, suggest that it could not escape any obstacle.

If you watch the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written in the words of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although written on the back of the document, it is not a valuable map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there was a small printed copy of the original "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document.
No one can be sure who wrote it, but the large (293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) parchment is known to have been used for decoration.
the text may therefore have been added as a sign.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, the southern part was not.
The French were under the control of the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 august 1940, allied forces invaded southern france in what became known as operation dragon.
Within two weeks, American and French troops had liberated southern France and moved into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture where many people live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilicus, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civita, which means city or city-state, and thus describes the development of society.
Cities go before countries. Civilization means the passing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural bond and equitable distribution.
Microcultures often disappear without the aid of systematic historical evidence and thus cannot be identified as true civilizations.
During the Civil War, the Thirteen States formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and no national executive or judiciary, so it was dependent on government officials, who were often uncooperative.
It also did not have the authority to change the tax laws and treaties between the states.
The articles required the approval of all governments before they could be amended and the governments were often unrepresented, as they viewed the central government as a threat.

Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as the "Cluster of Islands" in its geography, because it is composed of the Kumura/Japanese Islands
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors called the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which revolutionized Aboriginal crop production and allowed Chinese merchants to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was proclaimed a Qing imperial province.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first sino-japanese war (1894-95), the king signed the treaty of shimonoseki, which ceded the island of taiwan to japan, which had ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intiwatan Sun Temple and the Three-Square Room.

By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this continues to be the case today.
For example, the world's most common film format is 35 millimeters, which was the largest film format in the late analog era.
Today, the amount of photography that is produced, and more importantly, the scale of its production, has been overtaken by electronic camera devices.
The 35 by 36 millimeters are 24 millimeters square.
So the ratio of this system (the simplest ratio is dividing by twelve to get the whole number) is 3 over 2.
Most common forms (for example, the family Epsom) are equal to or nearly equal to this ratio.
The many injuries in the SISO, which are often mocked, are a simple instruction that allows for vigorous movement while maintaining a certain order.
The main theme is that the most effective place is the cross-section of the statue, the lines dividing the statue into thirds (see example).
at this time in europe's history, the rich and powerful catholic church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite their differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive influence has influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is where the church's money is.
the central authority of the church in rome for over a thousand years the power and money that this gave to the church has led many to question whether this doctrine is true.
Soon after the war began, Britain was forced to blockade Germany's ports
This barrier violates the generally accepted international law, as established by various international treaties over the past two centuries, but the strategy has been found to be effective.
britain closed international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the ocean, a dangerous practice even for neutral shipping.
Germany was not very receptive to this method and expected a similar response to the uncontrolled submarine warfare.
By the 1920s, the idea that most citizens and nations were peaceful and independent was widespread.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations resolved to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of support from his father, Charles Bachelor, his first employer.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing the different periods, each Chinese hierarchy or each ruling dynasty having its own dynasty.
The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years, from the Han dynasty to the Jin dynasty.
During this period, intense fighting broke out between several rival claimants to the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest conflicts in ancient chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from republicanism to nationalism, and the belief that the country is a non-monarchical nation.
The job was open to all aspiring, powerful and successful male applicants.
The same thing happened to the soldiers because they were based on the caliber, not the military.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed slave-owners abroad to start their own.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the ordinary. He would go to the top of the mountain of Jannur (light) to meditate, called Jayiera.
The caves that survive from ancient times are the living remains of a spiritually inclined Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, resting on the top of one of the mountains in the northern part of Mecca.
In fact, even if he knows that it exists, you cannot easily find it.
Once you enter the cave, you are completely surrounded by it. Nothing is visible beyond the clear, pleasant sky above and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see and hear little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, is the site of the Giza Plateau, where many pyramids, many small tombs, and many statues of the Great Sophnix are found.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of women and members of Khufu's family.
The "arrow" symbol looks like a V and the "under the arrow" symbol looks like a missing arrow.
This means that you must start the arrow from the tip and pull it down from the bow (the hand that is holding the arrow).
The bow is often a low-pitched instrument, but the bow is stronger and more powerful.
Don't try to draw your own arrow, but remember that the written arrow symbol is often respected by music.
The king, Louis XVI, was so horrified that Queen Marie Antoinette, her two younger children (Marie Th√©r√®se, 11 and Louis Charles, 4) and the king's niece, the queen, were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, after a group of merchant women had left Versailles.
They escaped from Arabia and returned to Paris, where they were surrounded by a mob threatening to attack the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to unload their chariot.
Once a member of the gang shook the head of a guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people paid for the war of the United States imperialism against the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover most of the costs and the bank interest that floated through Wall Street's banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the greatest harvest of long-term exploitation of the Filipino population is the basic interests of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the simpler one must understand the surrounding concepts that led to the creation of the system.
The period of time in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages in European history, which spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 B.C.E.).
The high pre-medieval period was followed by the early medieval period and then the late medieval period, ending around 1500.
Technological critical thinking is a set of theories that range from technological pressure or technological dominance to the theory that human writings are guided by the basic rational thinking associated with scientific laws and technological expressions.
Most interpretations of technological critical thinking have two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has "a consequence" in the societies it inherits, not in social conditions per se.
For example, one might say that the motor of a car must lead to the elevated stairs.
However, the cost of car insurance is being developed to drive new production methods as the nationwide network of fingerprinting machines cannot be economically driven.
Many people are driving their cars in trees, causing many accidents on the road, which is causing new ways to treat injured bodies and new ways to treat health.
The intercourse with the opposite sex was a large part of the cultural determination of authors such as Gottfried Schlegel.
Around the geographical transition, individual identities were formed, and over time, traditions and customs associated with this geographical formation emerged, which were more in line with the social status than the rules imposed by the Houris.
Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, just as Constantinople was the fashion capital of continental Europe.
It began as a center of excellence around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
The 12th century order was destroyed by Christian soldiers returning with gifts of herbs and spices that were more expensive than those sold at Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic literature reached its peak during the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slowly changing climate, the western slopes may be 25 to 30 years shorter.
By the end of the middle ages, western europe had developed its own style. one of the great developments of the period was the use of the crossbow to train christian soldiers.
farming is the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family
Ecological farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses environmentally adapted seeds and transferable crops or other relatively simple methods to grow crops.
Historically, most farmers have been dependent on subsistence agriculture, a problem that is still common in developing countries.
culture allows like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society to share and realize their identity
Due to the age of the subculture, the group's location and/or gender may be unique.
Subcultures can be defined as a specific subculture by language, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership in a variety of symbolic ways, often involving fashion, ritual and argot.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the value of social interaction is to examine the adults who grow up with social isolation or who are victims of abuse.
Such children are called "baby-babies" or "baby-boys". Some baby-boys are under the control of humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases this neglect of parenting is due to the neglect of the child's severe physical or mental disability by the parents.
Untrained children may be more vulnerable to attack or injury before they are nursed or delivered.
Others reported being surrounded by insects, some suspecting that their voices were already ringing in the forest.
The newborn is raised by fully fledged animals and is infused with fears and feelings of individuality, as if they were wild animals being cared for like humans.
Although project-based learning can be made simple and fun to learn, scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a support for new learning experiences, such as a new computer program or a new classroom.
Scaffolds can be virtual and abstract, but a master is a scaffolding form, and a small paper cutter inside a Microsoft Office.
Illustrations are used to ask, direct, and explain sensitive questions for students to do on their own.
Children are vulnerable to adult exploitation for reasons such as neglect, abuse, and abuse.
No child should grow up without care, nurturing, and education, even if they don't have to.
We know that foster care or shared homes are a safe place for these children.
Our evolving care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, quality education and reliable health care.
The interest of the mortgage is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing from the previous home.
The Internet is a bridge between public and private communication.
The specific features of the Internet lead to the introduction of additional features.
For example, knowledge of kissing and social interaction are said to give them the moral to use the Internet (James Itall, 1995).
The role of the GLI and its subsequent interactions was identified as a new initiative by Egmeon and McCord (1998) in analyzing responses to visitor requests for web sites.
The use of video copying and micro-expression translation has opened up important connections for visual representations that last only a few milliseconds.
It is said that if a person is known to lie, then it is possible to translate the micro-gramma values.
Oliver Sacks, in The President's Speech, said that people who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can make a more accurate assessment of their honesty.
It also suggests that there are mammals, such as domestic dogs, that have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Twenty-first century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: pale and pale.
Mutations produce new mutations and cause the mutation to be removed.
Evolution and replication are phenomena that occur in the inter-generational cycle.
In the savanna, it is difficult for plants with digestive systems similar to humans to obtain the amino acids needed to meet their nutritional needs.
In addition, this lack of discipline has led to serious consequences, including chronic disability, blindness, and, eventually, premature death.
The richest source of protein in plants is probably the mushroom and the fungus, but it is difficult to digest without the help of a human host.
In contrast, animal products (wheat, milk, eggs) provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids, not just the easily digestible ones.
Considering all the circumstances, it should not be surprising that the way our ancestors solved the protein problem is as similar to the way we find the same proteins in the savannah today.
Sleep apnea is a condition in which you wake up during a normal sleep and fall asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to restore consciousness without waking you completely from sleep.
If you have lost your watch in bed, you can set the watch on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to avoid losing it.
Other biochemical factors include drinking too much fasci, especially water or tea, and a well-known diuretic called diuretics, which can cause the kidneys to swell before bedtime.
The degree of inner peace of a person is inversely related to the degree of inner stress on the body and mind.
It gives each person the ability to be happy and peaceful.
Everyone can be alert. What prevents us from that is our own stress and apathy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is also influenced by the Mahayana practice of love and the many wisdoms of Indian yoga.
The basic level of Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It contains the Kundalini, Yoga, meditation and all the elements of the right path.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is activated through yoga, breathing movements, mantras and meditation.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the vision of various deities, channels of energy are purified, the chakras are activated and a wake-up call is made to the phenomenon of the mind.
The Soviet Union and the United States were allied because Germany was a common enemy in World War II. The end of the war left the two countries at odds over their systems, traditions and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the original allies became enemies, and then the war of words began.
It has been in existence for 40 years, and has been fought in a variety of armed conflicts, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other theatres of war.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was ready to attack and reorganize its own defense of the bridge over Romania.
However, these negotiations may have been overnight; more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded eastern Poland after the invasion of Belarus and Ukraine, breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Intervention Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The best advice is to use a ship to transport large ships and people across the ocean.
The traditional job of the navy is to keep the nation's people and its fleet mobile, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move.
One of the most recent examples of this was the North Atlantic invasion during World War II. The Americans were trying to get their men and supplies out of the Atlantic Ocean.
The German navy, however, was using U-boats as its main means of traffic control.
The allies would have collapsed and Germany would have controlled Britain as much as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and nations began to preserve the simple diet of milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasturage areas, often as the offspring of extensive goat herders, which is similar to the common herding of goats. These herding methods are still in use today.
It was first bred in England in the early 16th century.
Although the chariots were only equipped with horizontal slides, they allowed horses to make the most of the most difficult roads and to pull even the greatest loads in the shortest of days.
The car was then towed to a wood-burning stove to stop the engine. It was later discovered that the stove would have a better performance if the stove was topped with metal.
This is a common practice, but the iron on the truck's wheels has caused more wear.
The first iron railway was built in 1767.
The first means of transportation was by foot, and the first humans, Homo erectus, began to walk on foot.
First of all, this Australopithecus would not have been jealous of the tradition:
The unique feature of the double leg was found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahalanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in harmony with our environment, we can support the environmental movement, and we can be active participants in reducing future pollution.
This is in many ways like symptomatic therapy. But if we want only a temporary solution, we have to find the root of all problems and put them out of work.
The human race has brought many changes to the world through scientific and technological advances, and through the many and varied ways of life that people have created.
After the July 4th Congressional Resolution was passed, a manuscript signed by John Hancock, the president of the Congress, and Charles Thompson, the secretary, was sent to John Dunlap, the printer.
A total of 150 to 200 copies of the Danlapp Broadside were produced.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 at the Freedom House.
A copy of the July 6 letter sent to George Washington by a soldier in New York on July 9 arrived in London on August 10.
Twenty-five of the Dunlap Road maps have been identified, the earliest surviving copies of the document. No original manuscript has survived.
Many modern biologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has disappeared and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of dinosaurs because they have wings and are very agile.
But there are still many bird objects that look like dinosaurs.
They have balanced and flat feet, they drop their eggs, and they walk on two hind feet like T-Rex.
Almost all of the computers currently in use are based on the fundamental numbers form of the information processing algorithm.
A binary number can have one of two possible values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits in computer jargon.
internal toxins may not be detected immediately. symptoms such as vomiting are a sufficient indication that they cannot be diagnosed quickly.
The best sign of internal selection could be the presence of an open container of medication or the toxicity of a home remedy.
A first aid kit for this particular poison can be obtained by looking at the label.
The term was coined by a group of professionals who regularly study the natural world.

Physiologically and biologically, observed phenomena are often determined by biological clocks, which are based on natural life cycles and reproduction.
Current symptoms that may not easily respond to additional timely solutions have been properly identified and treated for a wide range of organisms, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-winding clock, which can continue its independent cycle without any partial instructions.
Hersh and Chase's experiments were among the first to prove that DNA is a genetic material.
Hirsch and Chase use phage to insert their own DNA into a bacterium or virus.
They performed two experiments, marking the bacterial DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacterial protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, in addition to influencing the genetic material of interest and the host cell of the lineage.
Only in the germ line can mutations be passed on to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.

The highway is a major transportation hub that connects and supports everyone, but people use their own cars.
Science now shows that this new carbon economy has undermined the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transport. Almost everyone is able to make a claim for public transport.
In developing countries, similar complaints are heard about water pollution and the destruction of bridges.
Why do transportation systems have such problems, why do they fail every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental than that?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their respective routes.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict traffic flow with 100% confidence in the quality of the cars.
As luck would have it, drivers are more likely to be reasonable and more careful. Therefore, even the traffic waves have a certain degree of reasonable and careful behavior, and they tend to be more careful with their calculations.
To further illustrate the traffic flow, the relationship between three key characteristics is highlighted: (1) low, (2) high, and (3) low.
These contacts help in planning, operation, and maintenance of the railway infrastructure.
The birds were airborne, feathered animals. Their ability to hunt helped them to easily evade predators and to find food and supplies efficiently.

Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper and glass since ancient times, and they are relatively easy to mine using primitive methods.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that all matter was composed of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
He says that these elements are transforming into new elements, which is more like the four types of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma.
The periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are known as copper. Elements such as tin and gold are also called copper.
They can also contain a mixture of trace elements and trace elements, such as carbon.

The lunar surface is made of sand and gravel. The outer layer is called the crust.
The shell was about 70 kilometers long at the nearest point and 100 kilometers at the farthest point.
It is located below the Maria Kitti and the Berikbota.

Content concepts are based on what people are excited about or are attracted to.
The two theories suggest that as humans grow up, they have fewer needs or desires that are intrinsically related.
These theories ask why people want things, what they do and don't do in their environment.
Two well-known statistical theories are the Maslow's linear desirability theorem and the Hertzberg's two-line theorem.
In general, when managers start managing their existing employees, they tend to adopt two types of behaviour. One of these is to try to become one of the boys (or girls) in the study.
Such an irregular management has problems in making decisions, performing ethical tasks, ensuring quality, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
The end result is that he or she is transformed into a non-existent individual who feels that he or she has to do something for the group, and that he or she has to do it for himself.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often the behavior leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Although online groups are as effective as traditional groups, there are subtle differences.
Online group members are often the same group as the ones who meet in person.
