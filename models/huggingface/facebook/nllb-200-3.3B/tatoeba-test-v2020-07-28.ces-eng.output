Where were you all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before she ate.
I haven't told anyone about this.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a big tip on the table.
Nothing like a glass of beer after a long day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm happy with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
I'd ask him if I were you.
Leave them for us.
I have a map.
Well, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were going out with Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for it.
Tom is obviously lying.
Straight ahead and then right, and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why is there no food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom will be thirteen the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't stand to see her ruin her life.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
This belt is too tight.
It's not easy to play the bassoon.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer at home.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't act selfish.
Old customs are dying fast these days.
Tom is still very busy.
You'd better get going now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because a tree fell on the tracks.
What did Tom shout at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her big sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in 17th century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he climbed a tree.
Translating a Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We already know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought that to my attention.
I skipped breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not gonna be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You are a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
The hail is falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't do as well as we would have liked.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back this evening.
Did you and Joanna have a fight?
You owe me nothing.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need this more than you do.
He bought a car.
I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck here forever.
Tom got an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you take the train to school?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom going to visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
How about you buy me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There is another question.
I wouldn't be surprised if it did.
He's free.
That's not what people usually say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a clam when she got a record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd have helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can autograph it if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How can anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.

I was part of the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We camped on the grass by the river.
Tom never drinks hard liquor.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy on my own.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were walls half-destroyed.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could converse.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Have either of you ever talked to Tom?
You should apologize.
This fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you're going to regret it.
You've gained weight.
We should have won.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce from her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father is from?
What are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own two feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a fit of laughter.
Tom is wrong, isn't he?
Better dead than red live.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you could do that for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding was last week.
I'm still eating
The horse roars.
I lent Tom the ridge.
I'm boring
I'm writing my will.
I'm not being so stubborn anymore.
You're not gonna believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel alone.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the fair.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'm going to get a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
Used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there until he returned.
I made some terrible choices.
I should probably get back inside.
She doesn't have to work.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do this in the evening.
Why do you want me to ask them for help when we can do it ourselves?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Cover it up.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's thin.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom is home.
Throw the ball to Tom.

You should consult with a lawyer before you go.

Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like silent films.
This is working.
Stop your howling.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Could the report be true?
Easy to get, easy to lose.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If it wasn't for her help, I never would have passed the exam.
You wouldn't be any happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
There were a lot of people waiting for him.
