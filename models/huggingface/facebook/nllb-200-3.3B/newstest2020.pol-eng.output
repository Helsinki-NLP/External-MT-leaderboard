Father Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic guy, you know?
The masses he celebrates for liberation and healing draw crowds.
He was in his teens when things began to happen in his life that he couldn't explain.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.
The mass of liberation and healing, led by Father Witko, draws crowds.
One day, he was visited by the parents of a seven-month-old baby who had a 7.5-millimeter hole in his heart.
She was going to have surgery.
Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.
That same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors were astonished and said: 'You don't need surgery, the leak is only 1.5 millimeters.'
The parents were crying with joy.
After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.
As a teenager, he began to experience the Creator's spiritual wonders.
In his dreams, the souls of Purgatory came to him for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment of the memorial.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
My body started to change.
I lost my humanity and began to look like an animal, he says.
An invisible force was lifting him up, he couldn't make a sound.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him the way to salvation.
"Dipped in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form"...
He never told anyone about his strange experiences.
He had a calling.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He did not just want to preach about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people attend Father Witko's healing masses, hoping to be cured of their illness.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaroslaw
This afternoon (26 September) the team of Kolping FRAC lost to the current Polish champion Bogory Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
Jaroslawia in such a personal setup, as they presented with the Grodziszcans, have little chance of victory against the League's sovereigns.
And that's what the duel with Dartmo Bogoria showed.
The team is still missing the team leader Chen Jingqi.
With him, the Yaroslavlans could have won their third consecutive title in the new season.
The young Asian Qiao Han is not yet ready to play against such greats as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely, Mark Badowski.
The wrestler from Hellady was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both in the fight against Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class act.
After three fights, Kolping FRAC was leading 2-1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowsky, and Daniel Górak after an emotional five-set battle against Pavel Sirucka.
But then it got worse.
Gionis never gave Leia a chance.
There was still hope of winning by two points, but Qiyao Han couldn't stand up to Badowski.
There will be no additional testing for seniors.
Why would you do that?
According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
The agency explained in its reasoning that the target group was mismatched.
"These actions may even affect the detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to the difficulty of accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result", it is written.
The mayor doesn't understand the department's decision.
The money is ours, we have the money for it.
It's just that the government is afraid that if people get tested, they'll go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because that's what it's all about, to bring about a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All the experts know that this helps with the burden on the health system, because it helps with early detection and reliable healthcare.
The government has a very strange position here, which I don't understand, said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can't imagine the experts saying: 'Let's not get tested because there will be longer queues to see a doctor,' and if these experts are advising the government, then I'm not surprised that the health service is in such a state", added the PO politician.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all previous agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's next government attempted to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.
"If the next Israeli government that comes into being is going to implement this plan, we will annul all the agreements signed (with Israel) and we will withdraw from all the commitments we have made", he said.
"We will reject the plan completely and completely", Abbas threatened with pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible, no matter what the consequences", he said, "and to commit ourselves fully to the application of international law and the fight against terrorism", said the Palestinian Authority president, who made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the incumbent prime minister of Israel, was given the task of forming a government again after the elections of September 17.
A week before the election, he said that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would incorporate all Jewish settlements in the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by then-President Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections in the Palestinian territories during the UN General Assembly.
The last one was in 2006.
"On my return home, I will call for local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will be held accountable before God and the international community", the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, which is treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the prerogatives of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader ended his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the UN resolutions with all respect".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader would prefer to focus on the PA's efforts at the UN against Israel, rather than fighting calls for terrorism in the PA under his leadership.
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian land, the agencies noted.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the most vulnerable areas.
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic defibrillator AED can save lives.
The Provincial Emergency Service in Przemysl wants these devices to be in the most sensitive areas of the city.
For their actions, the officers received diplomas of congratulations from the Provincial Emergency Service Station in Przemyśl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and the Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs and Excise Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28th, while on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medycy, an officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian traffic zone.
A Chinese activist died in custody after being tortured.
He wanted to use his constitutional rights
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, received a call from the Communist Party secretary of her home village on September 23 to inform her that her husband had just died at the military hospital in Hengyang.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body butchered beyond recognition.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood", says the woman.
They wouldn't let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of police around who wouldn't let me get close to Wang.
The police pressured her to sign a statement saying that her husband was seriously ill and died in an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for companies in the video game industry from the National Research and Development Center
Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies in the gaming industry that create innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Center announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were the development of a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world with a data-uploading application by users; a testing and training platform for practical workplace skills validation and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating real-world production process management using a novel game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using Industry 4.0 concepts.
The objective of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game sector on the global market in the period up to 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs under this sector programme, which has already reached PLN 300 million, are a significant impetus for the further, dynamic growth of Polish games", the communication reads.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
Government incentives for innovation-minded entrepreneurs, such as R&D rebates, skills development programmes, the IP box or support programmes implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.
The head of the science department points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets  from the R&D rebate in 2018. Three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited than the year before.
The total of the R & D-related costs deducted was PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of over PLN 300 million for the companies benefiting from the relief.
This is equivalent to the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN, the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The Director of the NCBR, Dr Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that in the two previous calls for proposals, 78 innovative projects with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million were awarded.
The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the diversity of the applications submitted show that the video games industry has the ideas and the competence to continue to develop and increase its competitive advantage.
It is particularly gratifying that, as in previous editions, the projects selected include projects that are not only related to entertainment but also to Industry 4.0", she added.
In the third GameINN call, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with research units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The DoR received 87 applications for a total amount of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, so that 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polskie Gry Agreement, which includes, among others, companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga has confessed to the theft of a watch belonging to Kasper Dolberg.
The incident occurred on September 16th.
Dolberg, who had travelled from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, noticed after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, the angry Dane didn't show up for class, citing stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have their own safes, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and the rest of his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money to the Dane for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
Docei arrived at Nice as a 13-year-old to make his first-team debut three years later.
He's played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but as reported by L'Equipe, the club will likely terminate him with immediate effect.
He's already started disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the case.
Make sure you wash your hands properly
We all know that we have to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before eating).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that we're approaching the fall infections.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to wash your hands sufficiently to remove harmful bacteria and viruses
And most of us wash them shorter!
Warm water and plain soap are sufficient - not that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even discourage it).
When we wash, we rub not only the bottom and top of the hand, but also: the fingertips (jointly or individually)  rub them in circular motions with the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (interlace the hands, rubbing the fingers together), the thumbs  each thumb we embrace with the other hand and in such an embrace we twist it a little to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet towel and then use an antibacterial gel (from $5.00 in drugstores).
Do not use the washed hands to touch the doorknobs or doors after using the public toilet (recommended by the General Health Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iran's president says he rejected the offer of talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite a US offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The president of Iran stated that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He claimed to have met with American diplomats because he had been persuaded by France, Germany and Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not negotiate in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be", Rowhani said.
The previous day, the Iranian leader said he would not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favouring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal were a precondition that did not allow for the opening of a dialogue.
If we can lift this precondition and if America can lift the sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: Iran asked, I said no
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.
Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so we could meet.
Of course I said no! tweeted the President of the United States.
The tension with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, to which they were signatories.
It provided that, in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons programme and place the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed their intention to keep the agreement in force.
So far, nothing has come of it.
Washington has a policy of maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions include a full-scale embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has said that if it does not receive permission to export the raw material, it will reduce its commitments under the agreement every 60 days.

Judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of the heiter Emilia, who  according to her words and screens from WhatsApp  participated in stalking judges, was brought back to the hearing by the NSA on Wednesday.
Reason: No disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazura to remove him from office.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the NSA's disciplinary spokesman, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the WSA president's decision within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in a hate group, will return to the judgement and will issue sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies any involvement in the hate group.
He claims there's no evidence except for the fake screens and the words of his wife, who he's divorcing.
That's exactly what the other judges connected to the "Cast" are saying: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's entirely possible they'll play it by ear.
Because the prosecution did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, and they are silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she seized in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of the people who were persecuted by Judge Waldemar Żurek in February.
There is no evidence, there is no Smythe case, there is no Kasty case.
There's also no case against NIK boss Mariana Banas for renting out his apartment to pimps and concealing his income.
CBA's checking his financials.
And he will when he does.
The Committee on Political Ethics will not deal with Banasi because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control somehow met to take the curious decision to dismiss Banasi's deputies and appoint him as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
It reminds me of a movie, an American movie, I think, about a wife coming home and finding her husband in bed with her lover.
She's so confused and devastated, she can't even speak.
The door is shut, and the lover jumps out of bed, dresses, and leaves.
And the husband was making the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts, "What's that?"
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
But the question of "Casta" or "Banasia" is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny.

Camilla Lichwinko in the high jump final
The 2017 London World Championships bronze medalist, who returned to competition earlier this season after a maternity break, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
She only got a 1.94 in the third round.
I'm pleased.
I showed that I could fight, because the first attempt was a complete failure.
"I will have to do better in the final", Lićwinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
The best performers in the elimination round were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik  at 1.94.
Both of them were the only ones who didn't lose any altitude.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7:30pm, Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in the hospital in critical condition.
He was taken to the hospital, and the doctors say his condition is critical.
I should add that he is conscious and aware.
We believe that he will come out of this, that he will win again.
We are all praying for his recovery", said an anonymous person close to Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I am kept alive by my closest family and politics", said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was sent to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for testing.
I was experiencing strange, disturbing symptoms and I volunteered for hospital treatment.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer..., the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
Morawiecki said that President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation took about three hours and was a success.
I know that many people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any of those.
I don't know if I'm going to have chemo yet.
I'm leaving myself in the hands of medical specialists who are kind of nice.
For now, after this tough surgery, I need to get back to some kind of usable state.
I hope everything will be fine", said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with SE in January.
If I had submitted too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this executioner...

Nel Stoklossa is 14 years old, 5'6", blond hair and blue-green eyes.
Last seen wearing a blouse, grey trousers and boots.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is asked to contact the police on 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the owl's jumps.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the racetrack on Oleandry Street in Oławie, may be misleading for some.
The road to true power is a long one, but that's what one of the most famous horse racing events is called...
The competition of power jumping involves the rider and horse overcoming ever-higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed six feet [2 m].
It is worth noting that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, set in 1949 by Chilean Alberto Larraguibela, on his horse Huaso, is 247 centimeters.
Of course, no one has ever jumped so high in the Olav, but the score of the best local amazons at 135 cm is not the worst either...
The competition, organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "Sedle", was a demonstration of the "Rainbow Horse Competitions" held there earlier, which we will write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons, who trained in the Olaw JKS, joined the competition.
Four competed on pony horses, and four on big horses.
In the first group, the best was Nikola Sándora, riding the crazy Sprinter.
This small but dynamic stallion started by overcoming obstacles that were spread out at a height of 12 inches [40 cm] and ended at the station with the top beam being raised to a height of 40 inches [125 cm].
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was removed from further competition by the jury of the contest.
Second place in the jumping ponies was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy", and third by Lena Boruń on "Harmiderze".
The youngest participant in the tournament, Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small Carmen mare, was ambitious.
Even more excitement was felt by the Amazons and by the spectators during the competition with the big horses.
The crashes were caused by Paulina Szewczyk, who was riding on the "Declaration", and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the "Lotce".
Fortunately, apart from minor bruising, neither the amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to compete.
Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young filly "Wineta" to the parkour.
She needed either a trainer's assistant or another horse to ride with, and she was a little crazy about it.
After the obstacle was over, the parkuro was also coming down in full force, so it was dangerous at times in the pits and in the spraying area. "Everything is under control!" said Jan Sienkiewicz, calming the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
Since the start of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been doing great on the track, sitting on the beautifully presented Whisky.
This sturdy mare, paired with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase, was the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result of the race at that time.
However, after a while, the same height was also reached by Paulina Szewczyk in "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz in "Vineta" and Anastasia Abramenko in "Lotka".
After the float and the prizes in the form of riding equipment, the contestants went out together, and at the end, together with the Amazons on the ponies, they performed an impressive lap of honor in the rhythm of the Radecki march, ending this interesting and exciting competition.
Thank You

Max Kolonko is cut off from KWW
The Patriot Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Maks Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was aimed at young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but neither of these coalitions came to fruition, and the KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution was not even able to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Kolonko has now announced on Twitter that he has ended his relationship with KWW, Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution.
"I'll expect the K.W.W. to strike my name from the name.
Please do not link me to the above-mentioned entity", he added, adding that more information would be released soon.
It is not known yet if the journalist will continue his activities or if this is the end of the #RRevolution formation.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the US, reported on the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
We've had enough of your politicians, your stupid games, your amateurish governments.
It is time for the nation to take power in the state and rule for the good of the nation, Kolonko said then.
The party's agenda included issues concerning the judiciary (to be elected in general elections), tax changes (equal tax-free allowance for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the eastern flank of NATO, with special regard to Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political party, Mariusz Max Kolonko began to talk with Marek Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile a message suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, neither coalition was successful.
UBS: Gold near the break-even point
The euro will remain at around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, with weak global markets, predicts Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy are in favour of the zloty's stabilization at the current ceiling", the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
He said that despite the clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks were easing policy.
 The zloty is well valued  Euro quotations should remain in the vicinity of the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months  Polish bonds are less attractive according to him.
Emerging market bonds offer much better returns than Polish bonds, according to Michael Bolliger, Head of Emerging Market Asset Allocation at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the worsening of the world economy.
The global slowdown may deepen, but should not lead to a severe recession, and at most to a slight fall in GDP below zero, predicts Michael Bolliger.
Investors should be wary of global stocks, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution of the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Among equity markets, Europe is expected to be the weakest, according to the latest investor letter from UBS Wealth Management's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Marka Haefele.
"Eurozone equities are expected to perform worse than US equities, as they are more vulnerable to increased global trade uncertainty and concerns about a slowdown", the document said.
Michael Bolliger believes that after the stock market crash in the safest countries has pushed German 10-year yields down to minus 0.74 percent, there is still room for further declines.
However, in the long run, the yields of long-term securities should not decline, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of monetary policy by banks.
The Fed has the most room for rate cuts, which should weaken the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for the euro's quotations is the $1.29 ceiling, which would imply a 19 per cent potential for the common currency to strengthen against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy disparities around the world.
'Current and budget deficits may not be enough to sustain the dollar's strength in the long term', warns Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 pieces of ammunition  according to a confidential inventory compiled by the German Ministry of Defence.
The information was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary state secretary of the MON, Peter Tauber (CDU), so far two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been recovered.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are: six MG3 all-purpose machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 machine gun shells for the MG3 are missing.
The deputy leader of the Left Party, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming".
Especially since the investigation has only found a fraction of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "miserable balance sheet".
It also criticised the fact that the inventory does not indicate whether there are also weapons found during the investigation against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe charged him with preparing a serious act of violence that threatened the security of the state and violated the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing assassinations of leading German politicians with far-right and racist motives.
His blacklist of targets, which was handed over to the prosecution, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally obtained four firearms, over 1000 rounds of ammunition and over 50 explosives.
Crying kids on a plane.
How can we avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines recently introduced a feature designed for people who find it a nightmare to travel with a crying baby.
The airlines provide a website to check the seating arrangements on the aircraft.
If a minor is travelling on the same route and is not yet two years old, the 'child' icon appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or carers.
The person using the carrier's services is thus able to choose a place which is further away from the place occupied by the minor.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported on the imperfections of this solution.
The 'child' icon will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of aircraft.
As expected, the idea divided netizens.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying babies can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, we were once kids.
"We must learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of seating for mouth-breathers, droolers or drunks", wrote user G Sundar.
Another user said that he used to be bothered by crying children on airplanes, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me about screaming children during the 13-hour journey", Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca is counting the losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook Travel .
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be able to come to Majorca for their holidays in October, as a result of Thomas Cook's bankruptcy announcement on Monday.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, Marc Pons, said on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of their holidays in Majorca in October are also those who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who had to forgo their holiday in Mallorca next month because of the bankruptcy of a British company were German and Scandinavian citizens.
However, as Pons points out, since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic Government had already begun negotiations with international operators on entering the Mallorcan market following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October because of the tourism crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 of them are the fired employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
The rest will lose their jobs, mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, many Mallorca hotels were forced to pay extra hotel fees.
This situation was experienced by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that, as of Thursday, several dozen hotels on Majorca had suspended operations until at least the end of October following the declaration of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and its associates.
The Diario de Ibiza newspaper, published on Friday, reports that most hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government for €100 million to help the region cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, is in Majorca.
According to Balearic Government data, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, approximately EUR 5 million for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
The FIFA women's ranking.
Poland still 29th, US in the lead
The Polish women's national team is ranked 29th in the FIFA World Rankings, which were published on Friday.
In the same position, coach Mios Stępiński's team was ranked in the previous July list.
The staff's a little weak.
What about October?
The Americans, who recently defended their world title, are leading the field.
The Germans remained second and the Dutch third.
Polish girls are preparing for their ME qualification.
They were scheduled to start their home game against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting was postponed for a year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate the qualifiers with the meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Before that, White-Red will play two friendly matches on 3 October away from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce against Brazil.
The group's rivals are Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the three best second-placed teams advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barrages for the last three passes to the European Championship.
The 16 participants will be joined by the host country, England.
The Polish men's national team dropped from 20th to 22nd place in the September FIFA rankings.
Rz: Smog overwhelmed the government
"The effects of the Clean Air Programme are nil, and the coal-fires will burn as if they never burned this winter", says the front page of today's "The Times".
 So far, 82 000 applications have been submitted under the Clean Air programme for a total of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 000 decisions were favourable.
The total amount of the accepted applications is over PLN 915 million, according to Rz, citing the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, the program reimburses only a portion of the costs incurred.
The results of the lavishly advertised program are described as "modest" in the journal.
The self-government, quoted by Rz, sees the failures of Clean Air in too much bureaucracy.
The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, invoices sent by post, and possibly a random check of the implementation.
This would improve the efficiency of the operation, according to Jacek Wiśniowski, the mayor of Lidzbarek Warmiński.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm observe that less than 1% of the 3 million boiler replacement targets were achieved in the first year of operation.
As the Rz notes, although the budget of the programme is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, or PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year is set at PLN 1.4 billion, we read.
Congress agrees to the F-35 for Poland .
Now we negotiate the price .
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract is signed, but it is not the end of our work", Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
'We will negotiate hard to get the best price possible,' added the Polish minister.
The contract for the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to their sale to Poland.
The communication emphasised that the investment would support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO ally which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is paying $6.5 billion for the fighters.
But this is not the final price.
The State Department indicated that the contract would also include the supply of spare parts and repair, training equipment, engineering, logistics and human resources services, and related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
The Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter aircraft
The F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, fifth-generation multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
The aircraft is capable of close support, bombing and typically fighter-air combat missions.
The stealth technology makes the fighter undetectable to near-range radars.
Belgium recently purchased F-35s in a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want them to replace the aging F-16s.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering buying American fighter jets.
Barbie against the stereotypes.
Sex dolls
The manufacturer of Barbie has launched a line of gender-neutral dolls.
It's her way of fighting stereotypes.
The manufacturer of Barbie has launched a line of gender-neutral dolls
Besides the Barbie dolls with different skin tones, body shapes, and hairstyles, Mattel has also introduced gender-neutral dolls.
The toys in the Creatable World series wear wigs.
So the kids can decide whether their Barbie has to be short or long.
Their wardrobe is made up of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn from girls to boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothing.
The emphasis on sex characteristics has also been dropped  gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or  in the case of Ken  broad arms.
The company believes that children don't like their dolls to have gender norms imposed on them, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made for specific genders inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will make all children feel free", says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which was introduced in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been criticized repeatedly in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes" such as unnatural body proportions.
The company has responded to the criticism by introducing dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes.
The hijab dolls also appeared.
Zandberg: a circle or club Together they can have several dozen members
Zandberg was asked on ZET radio how many of his party's candidates could get into the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD, the list of candidates for the Sejm of SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo Lewica), he replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are hoping that the Left will not only have the right, but also the strength", he said.
According to Zandberg, this means that the left can have 60-80 MPs.
That means maybe the Razem club or circle will have a dozen or so deputies.
But that's up to the Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's gonna happen, he said.
Asked if Left Together would have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think the Poles have rewarded this diversity, because we have shown that by being different, we can agree on a common programme.
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, he said that the SLD would receive all the subsidy, and that the aim of the political party was to represent its voters.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
When he ran for the Senate, he said he was considering it.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates who are closer to my heart, but there are also those who are further away", he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take my electoral certificate and vote in another district", the politician stressed.
'I would not have voted for the minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (PAP candidate KO) ', he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are competing.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims came by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which can accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi sect of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago on a six-acre wetland area donated by the government.
The name of the Masjid Mas-salikul Jinan (The Path to Paradise) comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, who is revered by the faithful as a saint.
The mosque is faced with Karrary marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of these is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can hold 15,000 worshippers, and the other one can hold as many on the outer esplanade.
The richly finished interiors include a gilded dome, giant chandeliers, and hand-carved decorations by Moroccan artisans.
The builders claim the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.
The mosque, which cost over 30 million euros, was funded by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Our problem is not Silesia, it's us.
After eight consecutive games without a win, the Croatian players will try to break the tie in Friday's match with the vice-leader of the extra-class Silesian.
"Our problem is not the Wrocław people, it's us, we have to work on what we play", emphasised the coach of the team, Mirosław Smyła.
The last and so far only victory of Korona football players in the league was recorded in the first round, when they defeated 1-0 against the Benjamins of the match against Rakov Częstochowa.
Later, the bowl team recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
What makes me optimistic is that in the last seconds of the World Cup, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their falling to the wall after the final whistle was not a breakdown, but a fall of anger because they were so close, Smyła said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will make the team feel for the game in the side sectors of the pitch.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play", added the coach.
In the match in Korona on Friday, the pausing player for the excess of yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic will certainly not play, the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing from the squad.
But it's encouraging to see a few players willing to play in a cup match.
"We have a headache, it seemed like it wouldn't come back until recently, and now it is", Smyla said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the record of eight consecutive league matches without a win, while in the elite division anyone can win against anyone.
We make a good team.
"In the last few weeks, we may not have shown it on the pitch, but there will come a moment when we win and we believe it will be Friday", the footballer said.
After nine races in the E-class, Korona is in 15th position with five points.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.
Friday's game in Kielce will start at 8.30.
These trees could disappear from Europe altogether
42 per cent of the tree species that make up Europe's woodlands are threatened, warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
The list is topped by chestnuts and horsehair.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of threatened European tree species for the first time.
It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of their research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are 'highly threatened'.
The Red Book lists rapid urban growth and global climate change as causes.
However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that are found only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of the typical European woodland, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are endangered, and 15% of species, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
The main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists, are errors in logging, accelerated urbanisation, excessive felling, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
The report also highlights the threat to the survival of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and ferns.
'Human activities are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and are putting Europe at risk of extinction of important and underappreciated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet', summarised the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN European office.
I'm not promising 600+
"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them freedom of distribution on credit, which future generations will have to pay back", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, the whole policy of the PiS is a joke.
At the same time, the politician promises that what is given will not be taken away.
Schetyna assures in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.
"Today, there are more people of conscience who want to live in a normal state than there are PiS supporters, a party that has defied the values it preaches, such as modesty, humility, transparency", says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic assumptions of the KO election programme.
First, nothing will be taken, but we need to set a direction for the future, because PiS is only concerned with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is evident even after the dramatically low investments, he said.
Secondly, it is about harnessing the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work efficiently - and those who are entrepreneurial.
Schetyna explains that the KO program includes a project that will give Poles with the lowest income more than 614 zlotys per hand, and those with more will receive  for several hundred.
The politician also indicated that he does not want to compete for the distribution.
He said he'd do whatever he could, but he didn't promise 600 plus.
"I will never allow a Greek variant where the government and the opposition bid for broadcasting, and the country's financial collapse finally happened", he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błonka.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda", he said.
Pride is a step before a fall.
Kaczyński is as much a statesman as Banaś is crystal, he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to run for the Platform presidency.
Argentina: Six large condors dead
Six giant condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity may have contributed to their deaths.
The giant condor was probably poisoned to kill predators such as the puma, fox, and wild dog.
The animals could have eaten the toxic carrion.
Except for one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor has to reach 10 to 15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species", says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
'I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,' he adds.
They want a jewel for the president.
The work has begun on the awarding of the head of state with a precious chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda, according to the "Rzeczpospolita".
The newspaper explains that it is the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.
It was probably last used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
The Rz says that soon such a chain may hit the arms of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted Wednesday to begin work on an amendment to the Orders and Decorations Act to restore it.
The diary says this is not the first attempt to restore the chain to the head of state.
The Senate had proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was defeated by a single vote.
This time, the work is done in a flash.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, thinking they would consult the President's office.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position expressed in this petition", presidential minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued its work and again took little time.
"The President's Office has given us a short answer: it is in favour of restoring it", said the head of the commission, PiS' Robert Mamątow, quoted by Rzesz.
He submitted a proposal for a legislative act, which the committee supported.
The cops will be teaching the drivers how to drive through the intersection.
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Ciepliński and Piłsudski.
The actions of the uniforms are related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers not always being able to properly behave at intersections.
On Friday, September 27, police officers in Rzeszów will begin their "Crossroads" prevention activities.
The aim is to eliminate traffic obstacles: entering an intersection without being able to exit, not following traffic lights or signs.
"We often think we are alone at the crossroads, but we are actually making life difficult for other drivers", said Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice-president, a few days ago.
His words came during a press conference at the city hall, where the city authorities were presenting examples of improper traffic at intersections, which resulted in traffic jams.
The President then appealed to passengers to be sensible on the road and to avoid driving at high lights or texting while driving.
The German police have taken over the topic, and today they're starting the "Traffic Intersections" operation.
What's the matter?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of restricting traffic at junctions by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.
It's a common misdemeanor that contributes to traffic jams and traffic congestion.
She faces a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniformed officers will be alert to any non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and any improper parking at intersections.
They will also watch for lack of fluidity, late start-up under the traffic lights, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too much space between vehicles.
What intersections will be affected?
The street names are: Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellońska Street; Ciepliński from Piłsudski Street; Targowa from Piłsudski Street; Śreniawica Square from Dąbrowski Street or Hetmańską from Warszawskie Powstańców Street.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpaty will be carried out on the following Fridays in October.
They took over a company that disposes of waste from the Czech Republic.
Officials of the Environmental Protection Department of the Wołomiń District Municipality and the District Inspectorate of Building Supervision inspected on Friday an installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the Czajka sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is being disposed of, Karol Szyszko, the spokesman for the Wołomiń District Municipality, informed.
Inspectors from the Wołomino district police have conducted a check at a plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
The private Commercial and Transport Company "Dar-Trans" provides waste management services under an agreement with the Capital Wastewater Treatment Plant "Czajka".
The plant was inspected and the contractor was asked to provide documentation relating to his activities, Szyszko said.
He added that the post-audit report would be forwarded to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw, among others.
The last inspection in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Voivodeship Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.
It was found that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and groundwater studies, and did not have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant in Čajk.
After the WIOŚ inspection Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The private company DAR-TRANS Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilised municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka waste water treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site, up to 60 000 tonnes of waste are processed annually in the forests around Zielonka.
Warsaw Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, the STUOŚ was taken out of service, which was related to the damage of one of the incineration equipment.
The Polish authorities have also provided information on the export prices of the products from Poland to Poland, Poland, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Ukraine.
Lech Walesa supported Margaret Kidawa-Błońskaya, who was the first to be elected to the Polish Parliament.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, and you can count on my full support", Lech Wałęsa told Małgorzata Kidawa-Błonska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me", replied the Civil Coalition candidate for Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now "just a retired supporter".
On Friday, Ms Kidawa-Bławska met former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
Walesa's son, Jarosław, also participated in a brief discussion behind closed doors.
"You have undertaken a difficult task", Lech Wałęsa said after the meeting.
"You can count on my full support", he added.
The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, great hope that you as a woman can cope with these problems, and we all  those who love Poland  will support your actions to the maximum,  said the former president, addressing Kidawa-Błonskiej.
Very important words
Kidawa-Blonsky thanked for their support.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me because nobody like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important this is", she said.
Let's show that we can make a different, smart policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
"This is how you made your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland", Kidawa-Błońska said.
Retired stallions
Wałęsa told reporters that he is now just a retired football fan.
Of course I'm looking into it.
I hope we can reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, we can go back to.
The separation of powers is paramount, the constitution is paramount, the courts are indispensable.
And all of that needs to be cleaned up, all of that needs to be brought back to normal operation, and I believe that this time we're going to do that.
If not, we will be subject to the street test, said Lech Wałęsa.
That's why it's so important for Poles to go to the polls, think about it and make their own decision.
And that's the most important thing, added Kidawa-Blonska.
"Last chance to improve the situation in Poland", the former president replied.
We must build on the foundation
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President has said it very well.
We have to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the tripartite government does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it a matter of course and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.
ME volleyball: Slovenia v Poland 3-1 in the semifinals.
In the hot field in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players faced the Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heinen in the lead role.
White and Red lost 3 to 1 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key bills
The Senate passed the bill on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
The amendment to the Law on the Estates of Families of Public Officials was voted by 52 senators, 14 against, and three abstained.
The senators have decided to reject the 12 amendments, which were proposed during the debate by Senator Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to 'legitimize' and limit the scope of the information given in the declaration on the financial situation of children, spouse's children, children adapted to cases where children are in a common household with the person obliged to make a declaration.
The Law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was drafted by the Prime Minister's Office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions provide that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, will be required to include in the declaration of assets information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons in joint debt.
The Senate has not proposed amendments to the law on the flights of the most important people in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes with the most important people in the state.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the management of the Central Flight Register.
The bill, without amendment, was approved by 55 senators, 12 were against, and four abstained.
According to the law, any flight of the President will be an official mission.
The President will be able to be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
However, the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate shall be limited to the performance of tasks directly related to the function performed.
The law also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important people in the state during the flight.
According to the regulations, delegation members may be on board  invited Members of Parliament, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; and journalists.
According to the law, if there are doubts about the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of KPRM will ask for clarification.
If such doubts are not resolved within the time limit, the Head of KPRM will be obliged to inform the Heads of Chancery of the Sejm or Senate of the impossibility of organising such a flight.

The Poles, after their first training in Paris, are waiting for their last rival.
The Polish volleyball team held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play in the bronze medal match on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's team lost the title to the Slovenes 3-1 in Ljubljana on Thursday.
There was a lot of talk about their traveling troubles for this match.
This time, they had no such problems. On Friday morning, they took a charter to Paris with the Slovenes, and a few hours later they had a training session in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to reports from those who attended the class, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heinen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol noted, this time the main task was not just to practice the volleyball elements.
We went to the hall, but it was mostly band time.
It was more about spending time together than training.
Talk, figure out how to rebuild it as a team, he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final loss was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
We were brutally brought down to earth.
We are clearly disappointed.
We kept believing we'd be back in this game.
We discussed this game amongst ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
I would put the two main reasons for the defeat were inefficiency in offense and much worse than normal handling of the balls of the situation.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect, he analysed.
In his opinion, the White-Red team was not hindered by the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and numerous audience.
He admitted that the world champions might have been a little sleepy on their way to the semi-finals.
Maybe if we had lost in the group stage in a similar way, we would have learned the lesson sooner and then played differently in the next round.
But that's only when he's sober.
Gogol hopes that the anger over the Poles' defeat on Thursday will be transformed into aggression in the bronze medal match.
I hope we can show our true colors.
There's a lot to fight for.
The last medal we won was in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-finals they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: Stern punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player was handed a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine in a six-month suspension for his foul words, gestures and actions during the recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour players are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the most unblemished professional tennis player in recent years looks ominous  16 weeks of suspension plus a substantial fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months  a probation period during which the brash athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been out there for a long time, and he's set a world record for the most money he's ever had to pay in a single game for violating the rules of conduct on and off the court.
Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike conduct, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets in a losing match against Karen Chaczanow... all of which paid $113,000 after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August.
He did not play for long in the 2019 US Open either, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists were corrupt, which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the aforementioned verdict of the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, the corruption charge was dismissed after the accused was heard and the context was established.
In their statement, however, the tennis activists said that the investigation had shown that Kyrgios' behavior over the past 12 months had raised serious concerns in many cases and constituted a near-constant violation of the rules, that he had continuously insulted people associated with the tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the heavy punishment.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply with several conditions within the next six months: Kyrgios may no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct for professional tennis players in any way on the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour, in particular he may no longer swear, destroy rackets, argue with the judges and the public, or otherwise behave in an indecent and vulgar manner.
He was also advised to seek ongoing support from mental health coaches during tournaments and to consult with those who specialise in dealing with athletes with behavioural problems in the off-season.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all.
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as he suffered a shoulder injury in the Lavera Cup, so he had to cancel the next starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6 October - 13).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
He's won two tournaments this year, in Washington and Acapulco, and he's made over $1.3 million, so even with the fines, he's got a lot of money left.
Life in Poland is getting better
A report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday showed that as many as 44% of households rated their material situation as good or rather good in the year ending in October.
The previous year it was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5% and before that  since 2009, when the Statistical Office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households  it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation to be poor or rather poor last year, compared with 11.2% the year before and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households of selfemployed persons is the best.
In this group, over 70% of respondents considered it to be good or rather good.
At the other extreme are the households of the rentiers, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the household's financial situation.
Single parents are the worst off, with 32 percent of them reporting a good or fairly good financial situation.
Among couples with children, the proportion varies from 55 to 60 percent (depending on the number of children), and among households without children, it is 48.8 percent.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and families with at least three children were assessed on their financial situation.
The improvement in the subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.
But that's not all, because the percentage of households that think they're doing well is growing faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the voivodship level there is no clear correlation between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The highest ratings come from the inhabitants of the Opole region, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The following provinces are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
In the case of the Opolskie, the disposable income (i.e. after tax and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average in the year in question, and in the Lubuski 98%.
The highest incomes were in the Mazowieckie (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%) regions.
The average disposable income per person in Poland was PLN 1693 in 2018.
The Union industry's sales volume and market share developed over the period considered as follows:
Compared to previous years, this is a rather low score.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7 percent, and the following year by 6.3 percent.
While it slows down income growth, it also slows down spending growth.
These per capita amounted to PLN 1187 in the last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, per capita expenditure increased by 1,9% in real terms, compared to 4,3% in 2016.
The household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household now spends 70,1% of its disposable income, whereas back in 2014 this share was over 80%, and until 2006 it was over 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the crew of an aircraft carrier
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five members of the ship's crew have died.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of these incidents occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the case has excluded third parties.
And the deaths are not supposed to be connected.
Everyone needs to be involved in providing suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
"I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or repercussions associated with seeking help", Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's commander, wrote on Facebook.
A non-Nicene critic of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing wrong .
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981, John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
"Every word of his was accepted".
Later, criticism of some of his actions emerged.
To me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to stop Rydzyk's harmful activities is a great blow to his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist  damaging the Church and Poland  developed his media in the best way possible during the life of the Polish Pope, he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: "There were murmurs of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyk was not accepted, but he had the power and for political reasons he could just throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
But John Paul II did not, nor did his successor, explained Niesiolowski.
And then there was this whole, fatal thing about pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather the lack of them.
I was a little ahead of myself, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been known for relatively a short time.
The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things, says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.
In the opinion of the former Polish politician PO, the Church is an ally of PiS.
'It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.
All the ceremonies began with Holy Mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisa, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship, a sign of the Pisa regime.
I repeat, one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly, Niesiolowski insisted.
"I hope that Pope Francis will expel Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type", he concluded.
Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the county.
There'll be gala concerts and auctions.
The jubilee gala will be held at the Hrubieszów House of Culture.
First, at 10 o'clock in the church of St. Nicholas will begin the mass of St. Nicholas.
The official opening ceremony will take place at 11:30 at the HDK.
The Hrubieszow Land Song and Dance Company will perform.
The youth of the I LO named after Stanisław Staszic will present a performance entitled "Powiat hrubieszowski: Hence my family" "I live here".
Afterwards, the medal "Dedicated to the Hrubiezow County" will be awarded.
At 4 p.m. the event will move to the city square, where the "Hrubiesz" will perform a charity concert for Angelica Zińkiewicz.
The bands that will be performing are NoLimit, Malibu, the Energy Girls and the star of the evening, Mig.
There will be an auction, including pens and china of the President of the Council of Ministers.
The PPNZ is throwing fines for the stadium riots.
Gryff disqualified
The match in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk almost ended tragically, when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović, was shot by the fans from Wejherowo.
After the incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating the case has issued a severe penalty to Gryff, barring him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
And, in addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium for the next game.
They can't go out in groups for league games until December 31st.
The fans of Śląska Wrocław also caused riots at the Widzew Łódź stadium.
However, the PZPN's judgment was milder here, because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and alerted the relevant authorities to the matter.
However, the authorities allowed the Lodz fans' sector to be raided, the chairs burned and the host's sector to be forced.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the police had to use a water cannon to intervene.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban also covers Extra-Class league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
The GDDKiA of the Republic
In the Podkarpacie region, the implementation of the amendment to the Ministry of Infrastructure's regulation on, among other things, the inscription of foreign city names on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, Lviv will appear next to L'viv.
In our province, 94 road signs will be changed along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
We're hearing it's supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines are the result of the amendment of the Minister of Infrastructure's regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
We should remember that the names of places in neighbouring countries often have Polish sounds too.
Thanks to the change in the law we're preparing, they'll finally be on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking will begin with the sub-Carpathian section of the A4 motorway, Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
In the Podkarpat region, 94 road signs will be changed on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of the investment?
Two hundred thousand.
The first step will be to implement the new signage on the A4 motorway, which is planned to be implemented by 1 November 2019.
What's the implementation of the idea?
It's not gonna be a plate change, it's gonna be a sticker change, basically.
They will replace the existing names of the localities with new ones, written in Polish on already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line  in the original Polish, followed by the original in brackets.
This will be a great help for people who do not know how to spell the names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot a swan with a fan.
In a pond in Zamecznie, Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with a problem with its wings.
After the fish were caught and the vet visited, it turned out that someone had made a target out of the animal.
The information about the wounded bird was received by the residents of the village of Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Novi Sol.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We're going to the place.
I could tell right away there was something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely to avoid harming him and exposing him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
By the time the first X-ray was taken, it was clear that someone had made a rifle shield out of it.
His body contained fragments of gunpowder, says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which runs a rehabilitation center.
It's going through the middle.
The birds have been cleaned, given antibiotics, given access to water, and given a safe place at the center to spend the winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He's not flying yet.
Releasing him now would mean that he would most likely not survive the winter, Walasek adds.
After the swan is rehabilitated, the staff plan to release it in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of Żukowice, after receiving information about the cause of the animal's ill health, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The incident happened in Zamechno.
Gowin: We need to stimulate Polish small business
Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade, said Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, and leader of the Agreement on Friday.
Gowin said during an interview on "Signals of the Day" on radio Jedynka that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to combat, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to face it at the very beginning of its term, but received a "contra" from the EC.
"We have won in the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this issue", he said.
He also pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish retail trade".
The Commission will also be looking at whether the government has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade, Gowin said.
In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission had erred in finding that Poland's retail sales tax constituted illegal state aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act introduced two rates of tax on trade: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to be applied from September 2016.
In September 2016, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure against Poland.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
It then held that the levy had been imposed unlawfully.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels had been completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the collection of the tax was suspended.
The EU court's decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the EU Court of Justice press service informed PAP that the case is now in the written stage, with both the European Commission and the Polish government presenting their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when oral proceedings will be opened, i.e. hearings and a possible trial.
It takes a good few months to a dozen months from the time of the appeal to the time of the judgment.
'Such proceedings take an average of a year,' a source at the Luxembourg Tribunal told PAP.
How to dress a baby for baptism?
We suggest some practical solutions
Baptism is a very important event in the life of a newborn and of its parents.
Often it is the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the newborn, celebrating his arrival in the world.
It is no wonder that newlyweds want their baby to look his or her best on this special day!
But before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will be comfortable.
In fact, many clothes that are sold in stores do not provide the comfort that a baby needs.
So what should be considered?
The primary criterion for choosing a baptism garment is the child's age
Until recently, babies of a few weeks old were baptized in white suits and placed in the same bunks or large stools.
Today, children who receive Communion are often older: months old, a year old, or even older.
It's not hard to see why such a great consolation needs a different baptism robe.
So if your child is 3 or 4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will likely spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the arms of a parent or godparent.
The best solution is to dress him in comfortable cotton sleeping clothes or suits.
Although this wardrobe item is considered to be a casual item, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example with a falbank or a coronet.
For a boy, the perfect outfit is a body with a bow tie and a bow tie.
For older children, you can allow for more imagination in dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tiula dress.
Many parents of girls look forward to the richly embellished, flowing christening gowns, complete with coats, belts, and hats.
Unfortunately, many manufacturers use artificial, nonbreathable materials that are simply uncomfortable for a child.
To find the right outfit, you may want to visit Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant cotton underwear.
Delicate silk skirts, satin dresses, crowns, applications, and cute outfits will make your little girl look lovely and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, the trend among boys' parents was to dress up in suits that were copies of adult models.
Polyester jackets and pants, stiff collars and caps often made the younger generation loudly express their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they've been replaced by comfortable cotton suits.
Just look at the kits available at Asanti for Kids, which are soft, tight-fitting trousers, plus a blouse with a frontal decoration that resembles a waistcoat.
These costumes look very festive, yet they do not hinder the movements of the exploring toddler.
Krystyna Pawłowicz has published her property declaration
Krystyna Pavlovich filed a declaration of assets at the end of her term.
It shows that the PiS MP has accumulated 110,000 PLN in savings.
Let's remember that Pavlovich announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has a total of 110,000 PLN.
According to the statement submitted by the MP, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,7 thousand.
Pavlovich owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 plus a smaller one, which he rents out for PLN 880 a month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150 000.
Earlier, the declaration of assets was also published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on the recess for the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party's annual conference, as requested by the government.
The vote was 289 to 306.
The House of Commons does not usually deliberate during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to give up their participation in them or their parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties agreed that Parliament should not be suspended at such a crucial time as the final weeks before the UK's planned withdrawal from the European Union on 31 October.
The government's motion for a recess was passed by 289 votes to 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The opposition's refusal to grant a recess could be seen as political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the decision was ruled illegal and unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for refusing to apologize for it after the judges ruled against it.
After the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.
It's time to make Brexit happen.
It must be implemented to respect the referendum result.
Brexit has to happen so that we can deal with the deal on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country, Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups - the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of Parliament was the party conferences.
Andrzej Duda blames Israel for the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland, according to the Polish media
President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders, according to foreign media.
The president's spokesman has strongly denied the reports.
"It's just not true", wrote Błażej Spychalski on his Twitter account.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York stated that Israel is to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz, who said in February that 'Poles have sucked up anti-Semitism with their mother's milk'.
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating remarks of its politicians.
He also mentioned the attack on the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted "Polish, Polish".
The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true", wrote Błaża Spychalski on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda had never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
According to the Spychal portal, he invented it.
According to the interlocutors, the meeting also saw a dispute between Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg, a recipient of the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was going to agree with President Duda and say that it is the Jews of Israel, people like Israel Kac, who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the website, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's testimony.
Who is the bastard and what did he do?
A tenement rented by pimps led a journalist to discover negligence in the property declarations of Mariano Banas.
Summing up another scandal that has rocked the ruling camp.
TVN's "Supervisory" journalists revealed that Marian Banaš, the president of the Supreme Audit Chamber, has not been filing a property declaration for a 400-meter apartment building located in Podgórz, Krakow, in recent years.
Moreover, the tenant was to conduct a sex business in the apartment building (i.e. rent rooms by the hour).
The Commission also found that the State-guaranteed ELA was not a guarantee for the State.
The anomaly was brought to the attention of Bertold Kittel in the program "Supervisors".
The journalist revealed that Banas had rented the apartment to people connected to the criminal world to use it as a place for "erotic encounters".
The clients were supposed to be men who were using the services of prostitutes.
Banaš's answers to the accusations were vague and vague.
Interestingly, a tenement rented by the pimps led a journalist to discover negligence in Banas's property declarations.
The tenement itself was described in them in an obscure way, and the rental income was to be underestimated.
The estate of Mariana Banas and his wife could be worth between 6 and 8 million zł.
In total, the couple can boast two houses, three apartments, savings [...]", Money.pl writes.
And according to the portal's analysis, the Banasia stone itself was already worth about 3 million zlotys.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of the financial statements of Mr Banas for the years 2015-2019.
The mayor has announced that he will suspend his activities in the NIK until its completion. "I will ask the marshal for a leave without pay", he assured.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
We're not hearing from the CBA that they've expanded their investigation or accelerated their investigation of Mariano Banassio's financial statements.
Therefore, we are forced to hand over state bodies and file a notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...], - said MP Mariusz Witczak.
"If a normal Pole had so grossly undervalued his property lease, he would have had 10 inspections, tax deductions and a criminal-treasury proceeding", he added.
He went up high, he fell down low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was put forward by Law and Justice and voted for by politicians of that party.
Previously, Banaś was associated with NIK in the years 1992-2005. He worked in this institution as a colleague of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first PiS government (2005-2008), Banaś held the position of President of the Customs Service and, in addition, Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again been the Head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been the Head of the National Tax Administration.
For three months, Banaš served as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master launches a graphics card holder
Graphics cards can weigh a lot of money these days, and that naturally gives way to a category of products that would have been a vain search on store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution  holder for the ELV8 RGB  graphics card presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphics card holder model is not only a functional solution that allows a graphics card to be held more securely without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Master ELV8 RGB cooler also has an additional decorative function.
"Republic": Ignoring the order of a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, the violation of a police officer's order to behave in a certain way is a new type of offense, punishable by fine, arrest, or imprisonment.
That's the change the police union wants.
The idea was put to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
"The case is serious, as more than half a million cases of misdemeanour are brought before Polish courts every year", it says.
The Republican Party has determined that the petition that the Independent Police Union is writing to the MPs to amend the code of offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose to rewrite Article 54a of the Criminal Code.
It should read: 'Anyone who does not comply with a request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be subject to arrest, fines or restriction of freedom.'
"Paragraph 3 of the provision provides for the same punishment for those who, by not following instructions, make it impossible or difficult to carry out official duties", the newspaper says.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that while he agrees with the main message of the proposed rule, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in cases of political demonstrations.
"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be detrimental and instead of alleviating the situation, it would actually exacerbate it", he adds.
The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the police take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe.
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed on the same list as Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of talent hung over Joachim, and he tried to use it.
After eight years, he returned with "The Sensitive Man".
The main characters are Buras and Soňa with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who can't get enough of a bottle of wine.
One of the boys hadn't made a sound since birth, and the other had stopped for a time in infancy.
But the heroes are not the main characters in this story.
They're all just a backdrop to a world where there's no place for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of a clogged provincial society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
"A sensitive man" sometimes turns into a ridiculous theater.
The narrative imitates the didactics, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears for its future, but also of unceasing questions about its past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is still operating.
The company is having problems, though.
According to VRT television, Brussels Airlines announced that it was cancelling 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with the office that were booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
At present, about 12 000 Belgians are abroad on Thomas Cook-purchased trips.
Another 40,000 people were to leave the office by the end of the year.
As recently as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy filing by the British parent company, which had caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office was reassuring the customers that they were going to go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan agreed in August, the company raise an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter, when travel agencies typically have lower turnover.
But the company's problems have been mounting for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

I don't think Slovenia played fantastically.
We played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet, said Polish national team captain Michał Kubiak after losing to Slovenia 3-1 in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for a review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion  such an unusual offer was prepared for the German visitor Görlitz.
The measures are designed to help combat the city's declining population.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel-colored old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
But the city is facing significant challenges, according to The Guardian.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also struggles with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west of the country, which resulted in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it was 54,000.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received.
Two thirds of the cases were in the big cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States, and Great Britain also showed interest in the program.
'When we applied, we thought the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz', said one of the participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not", he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant homes and an unemployment rate three times the national average.
Although the city hopes that some will move permanently, the main purpose of the programme is to get feedback from the participants.
The information gathered from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help boost the vitality of smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move", said Robert Knippschild, the programme manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy and Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the United States.
