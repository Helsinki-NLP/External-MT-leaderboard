Rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in the European Union/EEA and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/EU and the UK confirms, while in different countries, we are at a different stage of treatment, but pandemic COVID-19 is rapidly developing in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, other countries, hospitals and special care departments need to increase their preparedness to increase the number of patients with Kuwait-19 who need health care and special care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of cases of alopecia with unknown cause were in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the pathogen as a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that about 80 percent of people with covid-19 have a relapse, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without a relapse, and most of these recover.
In about 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more severe disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent experience a critical state that requires special care.
The death rate of patients in hospitals due to Quevid-19 is about 4 percent.
In this study, we evaluate the trend of increasing coronavirus outbreaks in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them to the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases in the European Union/EEA countries and the UK, with the number in Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Covid-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Following China, Kuwait-19 spread in more geographies, and the prevalence of the disease in other parts of the world now follows it.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Kuwait-19 a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the Eurosurveillance magazine on March 5, 2020 the first confirmed case of Kuwait-19 in Europe according to the World Health Organization definition.
In the European Union/EEA, three cases confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 of people returning from the Hubei Province of China were.
On 15 March 2020, cases of Kuwait-19 were identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and in the UK (UK) as a result of which, from 31 December 2019 to that date, 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths were, 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths and deaths were only in Italy.
Getting the Number of Collections and Collections of Cases Kuwait-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), cases in various countries around the world are obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the trend of Covid-19 in the European Union/EEA and the UK and compare it to the disease trend in Italy.
As an indicator for the prevalence of active cases, we calculated the accumulated prevalence of cases over 14 days, resulting in the natural period of cases in the European Union/EEA and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The aggregate number of cases by country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. was also compared with those by Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The trend of Kuwait-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day cycle of the Kuwait-19 rally in the European Union/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the Kuwait-19 assembly spread began to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (graduate students).
This is mainly due to the rapid rise in the number of cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar rise from the Kuwait-19 case (postgraduate applicant).
Figure 2 shows the aggregate number of cases in the European Union/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The figure shows that on March 15, at 8 a.m., the total number of cases in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the three weeks before or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of cases diagnosed with Kuwait-19 is rapidly increasing in the European Union/EEA and the UK.
The rounds observed in the Kuwait-19 collapse show that the pandemic is now developing at almost the same rate across all countries.
While countries are in different stages of the disease, the response of public health organizations varies, and there are probably different definitions and protocols in countries to select patients to be tested to validate QV-19 including increased test speed.
In early March 2020, doctors in areas affected by the virus in Italy described a situation in which about 10 percent of patients with Kuwait-19 needed special care, and media sources that hospitals and special care departments in those areas had reached their full capacity.
Information on receipt of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals or special care departments is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively.
To complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths, this information should be collected systematically.
A study conducted between 11 and 2010 showed that access to special and intermediate care beds varied widely across Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have less or more resources than Italy (12.5 beds of special care and intermediate care per 100,000 people in 2010).
Modulatory scenarios related to health care capacity saturation, with estimates for different EU/EEA countries and the UK regarding the prevalence of cases of Kuwait-19 hospitalized in connection with the occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of special care beds, are presented in the sixth update of the ECDC Kuwait-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since illnesses are classified in certain regions of the European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and special care departments typically serve the population of one region, information about illnesses and preferred special care beds should be available in the list of territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries indicate that pandemics in the EU/EEA and the UK are growing rapidly.
Hospitals and special care departments should therefore prepare themselves for a sustained transmittance scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with CEV-19 who need special care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 is necessary, with a rapid change in the approach to reducing the impediment, as predicting a rapid increase in the number of cases if not done too soon may result in decision makers and hospitals lacking enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response based on the trend.
The Rapid Risk Assessment lists public health measures to reduce the impact of this pandemic.
A short opportunity for the remaining countries to increase their control measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and reduce pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so will most likely cause other EU/EEA health care systems to face a wave of patients who will need special care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections in China and other parts of the world, a catastrophe for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2, like its similar SARS virus, which infected thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from the bacteria and may cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, Covid-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than young and men more than women.
This article, in response to the numerous publications on this emerging disease, seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, causation, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this article will help you to understand and root up this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were forced to stay home all holidays and weeks after the outbreak of a new viral disease.
It is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was also named CoV Disease-19 (CoV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of Kuwait-19 were, of which more than 40,000 were discharged and more than 3,000 died.
The World Health Organization has warned that Kuwait-19 is “the enemy number one of the people” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020, in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, causation, diagnosis and treatment have been published that have identified the viruses that have been separated from the body of several patients.
In this rotating article, we try to summarize research progress in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
If possible, we will try to compare Covid-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss the cases we have learned so far in relation to the prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as some other essential questions.
CoVs were traditionally considered to be non-fatal pathogens for humans, leading mainly to about 15 percent of common colds.
But in this century, we have encountered two highly infectious human CoVs: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with terrible rates of disease and death.
So, the current Kuwait-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a group of cases of alopecia of unknown origin were first on Dec. 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first deaths from Hawaiian were.
At the same time, the epidemic quickly spread to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, the health care department’s therapeutic team was and showed that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On 23 January, residents of the city of Wuhan were incinerated in their homes and public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was thought to have originated from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of the report, the disease has spread across China and 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the ultimate scope and severity of the disease remains a matter to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study conducted in several centers of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed cases of Kuwait-19 shows a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 vary in age, but mostly between 30 and 65 years of age.
Nearly half of those affected (47.7 percent) were over 50, a very small number were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years old.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
Kuwait-19 spread in various clusters mainly in and around Hobbit.
The initial period to diagnosis was on average 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average duration of the illness was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The period of beginning to death was on average 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base scrap number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people affected by the epidemic increased before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for CVD-19 were gender (man), age (over 60 years of age) and severe alopecia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, flexible viruses that contain a unique branch of sensory RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four classes of alpha, beta, gamma and delta, which specify the types of alpha and beta CoVs that can spread to humans.
Sodium glycoprotein (S) binds to host cell angiotensin and causes the conversion of enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in order for SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, and then renal coagulation occurs.
The virus RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after the virus genome is multiplied, the genomic RNA with glycoprotein and nucleotid proteins form virion-containing bags, which then bind to the plasma hose to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genetic outbreak was on January 10, 2020.
By genetically matching more than 99/98 percent of the 10 tuberculosis samples collected from the primary site of the Hawaiian seafood market, it was determined that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through examination with a sclerotic electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superthin part of the human coating tissue.
It was found that human ACE2 acts as a transmitter of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a hidden protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral congenital disease preventing the occurrence of IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known range of use or mutant.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues in the EM lead structure a full-length human ACE2 with a clarity of 2.9 angiosperm in combination with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which had open and closed forms, was combined as a demer and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two S proteins together, which could be evidence for the identification of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug use to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Creator and host.
It has been found that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from spiders and have been transmitted to humans by cats and turtles.
The phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs revealed that the bacteria are native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical with two semi-sarsic CoVs originating from the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21 bacteria.
However, the question of what intermediate host helped the virus to pass through the spheres to infect humans remains unanswered and the pathway of transmission still needs further enlightenment.
J and colleagues believe that snakes that contain the congenital compound inside protein S acted as virus carriers from spiders to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on a 99-percent genetic match in CoV found in Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, stated that eating Pangolin – a type of long-tailed beetle ants commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine – has acted as a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the two expanded genomes is still a big difference, so we are still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The chemical physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and at 20 degrees Celsius and 40-50% humidity for up to 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to radiation at a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, tar, 75 percent ethanol, chlorine, plastic acid, chlorophorm and other fatty solutions other than chlorhexidine, which can effectively deactivate the virus.
The human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore prone to infect the new virus.
Currently, no specific study of the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Generally, after the virus attacks the host cell, the virus is initially detected by the host’s own immune system through model detection receptors (PRRs), including C-type semilectin receptors, TLRs, NOD receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
The virus via various pathways causes inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and interferon-type synthesis (IFNs), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage of fagocytosis in the virus antigen.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The application’s security system gets involved in fighting the virus very soon.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific virus patterns and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
T-help cells process pre-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can interfere with T cell function by inhibiting T cell apoptosis.
Homoral immunity includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, an antibody separated from the patient improves, causing MERS-CoV infection.
On the other hand, an excessive response of the immune system causes the body to produce large amounts of free radicals, which can cause severe lungs and other limb damage and, in the worst case, lead to multi-member failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of its cluster occurrence, more often affects older people with background diseases and pregnant women.
The common issue is that people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or their immune system performance is weaker are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the SARS-CoV-2 hypertension period was estimated to be 14-1 days, but in most cases it lasted from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the fasting period is on average 3 days and the zero-time interval is up to 24 days.
A more recent study shows, as explained above, a fasting period of 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days), based on statistics of 8.866.
This is very important for health authorities to be able to determine the effective carcinoma time based on the most accurate period of stagnation, thereby preventing the transmission of the virus from infected people who have no symptoms of the disease to others.
A common practice is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually have to be carcinogenic for 14 days.
Should the period be extended to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the primary and primary symptom of cure-19, which can be accompanied without signs or with other symptoms such as dry mouth, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headache, headache, sore throat, rhinitis, chest pain, coughing, nausea and asthma.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath or reduced oxygen in tissues a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease rapidly progresses towards the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and blood retention disorders.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory and fever symptoms, even without radiological radiation imagery, should be examined for early detection of the coronavirus.
A population study at the end of December 2019 showed the following percentage of symptoms: 98% had fever, 76% had dry fever, 55% had shortness of breath and 3% had cough; 8% of patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings were in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster resulting from a transfer from an unsigned person.
A population study conducted in 2012 found that in patients with MERS-CoV, fever (98 percent), dry fever (47 percent) and shortness of breath (55 percent) were also seen as the primary symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them needed a ventilator device, which was much higher than those of Kuwait-19 patients, indicating a more deadly occurrence of MERS than Kuwait-19.
Cough (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99 to 100 percent), dry fever (29 to 75 percent), shortness of breath (40 to 42 percent), cough (20 to 25 percent) and fever (13 to 25 percent) have been shown to be the primary symptoms, with approximately 20 to 14 percent of people in need of a ventilator.
By February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576 cases, the mortality rate for measles-19 was about 2 percent.
By November 2002, SARS death rates were approximately 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS was estimated at 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study showed that R0 related to SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 and the 95 percent confidence gap (CI) is about 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 scale is presented with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 has greater prevalence than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but less prevalence than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
In this order, SARS-CoV-2 is much more difficult to control than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of a cluster often occurs in a family or from a gathering place or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often had a history of travelling or staying in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected people or patients two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been that people can be without symptoms, carrying the virus for more than two weeks, and recovered and hospitalized patients may also be able to re-transmit the virus, which is a warning for increased cardiovascular times.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or low.
For example, a condition of lymphophenia with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L included a lymphocyt count of less than 1×109/L, and an increased level of aminotransferase aspartate, and the presence of the virus in the blood was observed in 1,099 patients with covid-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood were increased in some patients, and C-reactive protein and red blood cell intake were often increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of Demer D, which is the result of the destruction of fibrines present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Evident abnormalities in radiographical images of the chest are seen in most patients with Kuwait-19 and are characterized by shadows of bipartisan fragments or dead-glass cortex in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal alopecia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome (ARDS) develop.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis severely jeopardize an individual’s air exchange.
Type I and type II dysfunction in pneumonia leads to a decrease in superactivity levels and an increase in surface stretching, resulting in a decrease in the ability of the lungs to expand and an increase in the risk of lung failure.
So the worse the radiography findings of the chest, the more severe the extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of Covid-19 pathology showed that the pollination of pneumocytes, the formation of glass membranes, and the penetration of interstitial lymphocytes and cystic fibrosis cells in diseased lungs that died due to the disease were compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related RNA was used as the primary criterion for diagnosis of Covid-19.
However, given the high false-negative rate of the method, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical symptoms (which were no longer limited to RT-PCR) to diagnose the disease began in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is necessary to have an effective, mandatory diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fing Zhong Group proposed a CRISPR-based Sherlock Protocol to identify SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2-related compound RNA components at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of inputs) using a tape in less than an hour without the need for expensive precise tools.
There is hope that if the new approach is confirmed in clinical samples, it can dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience of testing.
Given the lack of experience with this new type of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to patients with CoV-19, while various treatments are suggested to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressant drugs, steroids, plasma reception from improved patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma reception from improved patients was suggested for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce pesticides and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and may have weaker attacks on other members that have ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
In short, dysfunction and dysfunction of the respiratory system are the main risk to patients and the primary cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support for relieving disease symptoms is vital and saves a person’s life, which depending on the severity of the disease can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilator and aggressive mechanical ventilator.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by bronchial respiratory oxygenation (ECMO), a corrected cardiovascular biopsy technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition,ining an electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital function of the limb is also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been identified that cytokine storm is caused by an excessive immune system response in patients with SARS and MERS.
Citokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a cytokine series including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
This cytokine enables immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which is the primary cause of ARDS and multi-factor disorder.
Suppression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients who are in severe condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments for suppressing the immune system to prevent cytokine storm include guided immune response modulation with T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitory; JAK inhibitory; bleatoma; cytokine 4 symptom transmission inhibitor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressive drugs have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of high-dose steroids in severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19 was not beneficial.
In addition, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular stenosis, and have a dramatic negative effect on the improvement of the disease.
Simply put, short periods of use of corticosteroids in low to medium doses are recommended to be used with caution for patients with Covid-19 who are in critical condition.
At the time of this article, no effective antiviral treatment for this disease has been confirmed.
However, intravenous intervention with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient with Covid-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Remdesivir subsequently demonstrated the potential inhibition of other mono-RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead sent the compound to China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results were very promising.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Coughing, dizziness, stroke, liver damage and other side effects may occur after combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interference with other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma reception from patients improved and antibodies were produced
Taking blood from patients who have recovered from a chronic disease has a long history by using it to help treat other patients who suffer from a similar disease or to protect healthy people from developing the disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have a relatively high amount of antibodies in their blood to cope with the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunglobulin (Ig) which are produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other external agents and detect unique molecules in pathogens and directly inhibit them.
Based on this, plasma was obtained from a blood group of patients who had recovered from Quevid-19 and was injected to 10 patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, before specific treatments are offered, the use of this method on a large scale requires approval and transparency.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related side effects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate an immune response and develop cytokine-releasing syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening poison.
The concentration of plasma in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma for the treatment of patients is very high.
It is difficult to prepare and produce rapidly a specific pesticide that is enough to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, the separation of B cells from recovered patients and the identification of genetic codes that encode pathogens or pathogens that are effective against the primary proteins of the virus are more important and useful.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of puddles.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula that differ from one another depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its active ingredients are still unknown or unknown because it is difficult to extract and validate these ingredients or their optimum combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages because of the lack of effective and specific treatments for covid-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of Kuwait-19.
The highest rates of treatment in Covid-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China where they used TCM for 87% of patients, including in Ghanso (6.3%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). In Hubei Province, where only 30% of Covid-19 patients used TCM, the lowest rates of treatment (13%) were observed.
However, this comparison is not entirely correct, as many factors such as the number and severity of patients must be considered in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare Western Treatment (WM) alone and combined WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed to recover from body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and depression in a group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than in a group treated only with WM.
More surprisingly, the rate and exacerbation of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the performance and safety of TCM is still waiting for better controlled testing on larger scales and more centers.
Also determining the coordinator of the procedure and identifying the effective components of the TCM treatment or their combinations, if possible, is a topic that has aroused curiosity among scientists.
Suspicious or confirmed patients with COVID-19 often have a lot of fear of the disease, and even deadly, and people with COVID-19 also experience anxiety, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (lack of oxygen in body tissues), dizziness and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early stages of SARS outbreak, various types of psychiatric complications have been including severe depression, anxiety, nerve attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychological symptoms, anxiety and even suicide.
Compulsory contact tracking, as part of a public health system approach to addressing the outbreak of the virus, can cause people to be upset and guilty of the effects of infection, carcinoma and malnutrition among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapeutic care should be focused on Kuwait-19 patients, suspicious people, people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of mental health teams from various disciplines, transparent communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to cut off the chain of transmission from infected populations and humans to hosts and are often used as a complementary method for antiviral treatment in the control of viral disease caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to build S-protein-based vaccines to produce strong, persistent inhibitors or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Living impaired vaccines in animal models have been evaluated for SARS.
However, the effects of these vaccines on elderly and severely infected models and their protection against common human-animal viral infections should be determined prior to the start of the clinical trial.
This is probably because Sars was rooted 17 years ago and no new cases have been since then.
In contrast, spread cases and clusters of MERS continue to be seen in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the presence of animal-to-human transmission resources in indigenous areas.
Vaccination initiatives for MERS have been presented using inactive viruses, DNA plasmides, viral carriers, nanoparticles, semi-viral particles and neutrophilic protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The production of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-viruses is a vital task for controlling the epidemic.
However, overcoming this problem is difficult due to the long time it takes to produce the vaccine (an average rate of 18 months) and the dynamic changes of different CoV species.
Covid-19 as a new disease has begun to show a full clinical cycle among thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, Covid-19 is also associated with high complications and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a predictive model of disease flows is essential for healthcare and medical organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited capacity.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors may influence the prediction of the flow of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor for the flow of SARS, which is also true for Kuwait-19.
Quevid-19 mainly occurs between the ages of 30 and 65; a study of 8,866 cases found that 47.4% of patients were over the age of 50.
Patients who needed special care were more likely to have background complications and illnesses, and their age was greater than those who did not need special care (the average age of the first group was 66 and the average age of the second group was 51 years).
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Previous Diseases and Complications: Patients with Covid-19 who needed special care were more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-activated collagocytes and lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and background diseases are strongly interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested to be a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and ultimate recovery.
CRP levels are also suggested to correlate with severity and prediction of the course of Covid-19 disease.
In addition to this increased level of lactate, LDH, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely displayed in several organs, especially in your heart and liver, and are released as a result of tissue damage.
Therefore, as traditional signs are heart or liver disorders.
Primary clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19, radiography of the chest and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As stated above, steroids are immune system suppressants that are commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many people with improved venous stenoid disease suffer from lifelong disability and decreased quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low and short-term doses in patients with Covid-19.
Psychological stress: As explained above, many patients suffer from extreme stress since the onset of Covid-19 because they are often carcinogenic for long periods of time and have experienced severe insecurity and have witnessed the death of close family members and patients in their own room.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover and get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to the cognitive population studies that have been conducted so far, it seems that the epidemiological characteristics of Kuwait-19 differ from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to proliferation in the thin respiratory tract can effectively proliferate in the upper respiratory tract and have mild or mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
As a result, patients with early stages or stagnation can produce abundant viruses during their daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, Covid-19 is much more severe than SARS and is more difficult to control.
Many efforts are currently underway in China, including a ban on housing leaving in the city of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and a continued carnage of the entire population in the hope of cutting off the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain.
Although the measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the disease.
The most promising estimate is that the epidemic will end by March and the downward phase of the virus will continue for three to four months.
However, some of the other experts are not as happy.
Paul Hunter and colleagues have estimated that Kuwait-19, which appears to be fundamentally faster than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues founded a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 could be diagnosed in the middle nasal and throat veins of patients who had left the hospital two weeks earlier and had recovered, suggesting that a newly detected virus could turn into a flu-like cyclical disease.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on a decrease in the number of new cases that suggest existing strategies may be crucial.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million deaths and half a million deaths.
However, through carcinoma and severe separation, the disease was eventually controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become weaker by congenital disease and eventually disappear or become a low-genital disease virus that lives alongside humans.
The comparison of Covid-19 with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through measles or measles and is likely to be transmitted to the virus through direct contact with contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in the stomach, which provides the possibility of transmission from the stomach to the mouth.
A new study of 138 cases that 41 percent of cases occurred as a result of hospitalized infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 people from the care department.
Therefore, great care should be paid to protect people, especially health care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those who are in contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of contamination is the use of facial masks, which can also be through the use of surgical masks, and respiratory masks N95 (Siri 1860) that help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical mask prevents the passing of liquid droplets spread by potentially affected individuals through the air or sticking to the surface of the material where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (Siri 1860) can protect a person from the infestation of viral particles of 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5 percent of viral particles can completely pass through it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nanometers.
Since the particles can break even between five surgical masks, health care workers who are in direct contact with patients should use the N95 (Siri 1860) mask, not the surgical mask.
In addition to the mask, the health care staff should wear insulation gloves to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor who wore the N95 mask was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus; the virus may have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care workers should also wear a transparent shell and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public of people in contaminated or potentially contaminated areas, it is highly recommended that people wash their hands too often with anti-infectious soaps and try to stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet (one meter) is considered to be the right distance for people who stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and also prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a new virus, many of its counterparts with SARS-CoV on 7 January 2020 had a significant warning for China based on the deep memoirs that the 2003 SARS outbreak existed.
However, by January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control warned citizens, saying that the prevalence of the new virus is low and its transmission from human to human is limited and that there is no problem in preventing or preventing the disease.
The message significantly reduced the awareness of danger among the general public, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the vital time for the disease’s outbreak was lost on a massive scale in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned a hard lesson from this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be more cautious (i) because every word spoken by health organizations is important to citizens and can change people’s attitudes and decisions; (ii) rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials, they should be much more sensitive and respond to the unusual information received from clinics; (iii) rather than trying to restrain people, they should take more restrictive measures to prevent a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (iv) in order to raise public awareness of all diseases and to test and improve the community’s response system periodically, they should issue targeted and effective guidelines.
Covid-19 infection was initiated by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the virus has spread across China and 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and there are similar symptoms between Kuwait-19 and SARS, Kuwait-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that knowing them is essential for preventing the epidemic and treating patients.
Covid-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and its severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than young people.
The incidence of SARS was higher than in Kuwait-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmitted the virus even when they had no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmitted the virus when they were severely ill, making COVID-19 infection more severe than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A normal RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with Covid-19.
On the other hand, treated patients may have re-infected the virus and their test results are positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given such rapid progress in the investigation of Kuwait-19, several important issues remain unresolved as follows:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs are seen to be similarly muted to about 96% of the genetic neighbors, we can still not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is muted.
Which animal, as a mediator, transmitted the virus from the primary host, such as cows, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the outbreak may return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause further disease-dependent changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without an explicit answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long does the sickness continue?
How is the virus transmitted between humans, genetically modified?
Will the disease become a universal disease around the world, like SARS gradually disappears or recur periodically like flu?
Answering the above questions is essential, but it may take some time to answer the above questions and many other questions.
However, at any cost that may be necessary, we have no choice but to stop doing all this as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Human coronavirus creation.
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation have led to the simultaneous evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as colds.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown on the coin how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs back to the spotlight and surprised us with its higher prevalence, but the symptoms of the disease were less than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common type of disease between humans and animals, and identifying the animal origin of HCoVs helps us well.
Most of the originators of HCoVs are spores that do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as middle tanks for some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of disease in humans.
Examining CoV host interactions in animals can also give important insights into CoV congenital disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as animal origin and species-to-species transmission.
An important topic to discuss is the comparison of different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genetic novelty.
The current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful host change and the evolution of the virus for the severity of the disease will be discussed in this article.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of hypersensitive viruses, with positive pluralism and monodisciplinary RNA.
These viruses have the largest genome ranging from 26 to 32 calibres among RNA viruses and have been called "CoV", which is due to the crown morphology such as they are under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have integrated genomes that have a similar structure in common.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome consists of two large-covered re-reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that convert to the polyprotein replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein is processed more and produces 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome includes ORFs that are used for structural proteins such as spike (S), spike (E), ghase (M) and nucleoprene (N).
A number of side proteins that are ancestral-specific have been encoded by different CoV ancestors.
Based on differences in protein residues, CoVs are classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), among which the majority of beta-CoV genes include HCoVs and are divided into four genes (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that caterpillars act as the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers, and some of them have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoV (HCoV) have been known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or cough.
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, on the other hand, are severely pathogenic diseases that have caused underlying respiratory tract infections in most patients and are more likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and out-pneumatic symptoms.
The first genus of HCoV-229E, called B814, was separated from the rhinitis of patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, our knowledge has increased through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which have their own limited symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until SARS found out.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS, one of the deadliest outbreaks today, affected more than 8,000 people and killed 10 percent of the population.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak sparked a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to other parts of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), then renamed SARS-CoV-2, became the cause of the coronavirus epidemic in 2019, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm clock is getting loud and the world needs to prepare for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Each of the seven HCoVs is of animal origin, which includes cattle, mice, or domestic animals.
There is a number of evidence that the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs is known from herbs, in these organisms the viruses are well-adapted and are present without signs of disease and show large genetic diversity.
Kuwait-19 has created enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Animal disease tracking provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and limiting factors of species migration.
This could also facilitate the search for reservoirs, intermediate hosts, and hosts of SARS-CoV-2-enhancing animals, and have significant implications in preventing all future infestations.
In this review, we will look at animal origin, species-to-species transmission and congenital disease of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss this common theme where HCoV parent viruses are not normally pathogens in their natural habitat, but become pathogens after transmitting between species to a new host.
We also explore the evolution of HCoV, where an increase in viral prevalence is often accompanied by a decrease in congenital disease.
The consequences of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed in this context.
CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Prior to the primary separation of HCoV-229E from B814, from the nasal sinuses of patients with common cold, different CoVs were separated in various species of animals including bulldozers, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in time order (Table 1) can be instructive and contain good information.
In 1966, HCoV-229E was sampled from the respiratory system of patients with upper respiratory tract infections and subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell killing.
Patients with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headaches, coughing, weakness and throat pain, and fever and fever were seen in 10 to 20 percent of them.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 separated from laboratory membrane killing and gradually entered the brains of small mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those developed by HCoV-229E, which are not recognizable by the symptoms of other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed and are mostly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the stagnation time of these two viruses is less than a week, and after that, the disease lasts about two weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy people who were infected with HCoV-229E developed mild colds.
Only a handful of patients with immunodeficiency had severe sub-respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as “SARP”, is the first disease in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV and the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was in the Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak caused 8,996 people to get sick, killing 774 people and spreading in many countries and continents.
In addition to extreme outbreaks, it is estimated that each case can affect almost two more cases, with a stagnant period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, and then shortness of breath, dizziness and respiratory dystrophy appeared as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphanes, stable liver function tests, and increased seratine kinase are common laboratory symptoms of SARS.
Extensive aluvial degradation, multiplication of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages have also been observed in patients with SARS.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30 percent of patients needed special care and mechanical ventilator.
In addition to the subcutaneous respiratory tract, several organs including the digestive tract, liver and kidneys were affected in acute cases that were usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that could be fatal especially in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first sampled during a pulmonary tissue surgery by a relative of an indicator patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 separated from a seven-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially discovered that the disease is common in young children, elderly patients and people with immunodeficiency with respiratory diseases.
Scabies, worms, fever and bronchitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the separation of the same virus from a nasal sample of an eight-month-old boy suffering from the herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated.
Although the virus was detected in the Netherlands, it actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7 percent of chronic respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with cystitis, also known as cramping.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who had been infected in Hong Kong by alopecia and bronchitis.
In addition to the symptoms of alopecia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been to be associated with an exacerbation of acute type asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, the HCoV-HKU1 virus is found worldwide and causes mild respiratory diseases.
These four families, moved across the community, have adapted well to humans and are generally less prone to severe diseases, although cases occur for unknown reasons, such as a rare case recently, the malignant type HCoV-NL63 has caused a thin respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain them continuously in humans, the severity of virulence or fertile disease decreases.
MERS-CoV was separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute alopecia in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed laboratory cases of the virus originate in the Middle East, cases of secondary spread have been as a result of close contacts in different European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak in South Korea was confirmed in 2015 with 186 cases.
The clinical occurrence of MERS is similar to SARS, which is known as acute predominant alopecia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffered from acute clinical disorder, which is among MERS-associated HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients had digestive symptoms such as cough and strep.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were with high casualties of 34.4 percent, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known for humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with SARS-CoV-2-related infectious diseases were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the onset of the epidemic of sub-respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health emergency, calling it Kuweit-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90.53, with the percentage of raw deaths rising to 3.4 percent.
It is worth noting that deaths in Hubei China were 4.2 percent, compared to 1.2 percent outside.
SARS-CoV-2 such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory infections that are seen in the form of fever, dizziness and shortness of breath.
Sclerosis is also seen in some patients.
Alergia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% high nucleotide homogenity, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to have fewer congenital diseases compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
Some people with SARS-CoV-2ly had no symptoms that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and correlation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows significant similarities and differences.
The first case is that the period of infertility and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this relationship, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall course of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of Covid-19 symptoms is the middle limit of SARS-CoV and four HCoV transmitted from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
A single SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are commonly seen in HCoV infections transmitted from the community, including non-specific, mild or even in some cases asymptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, below a small set of acute cases of SARS-19 can also be seen for SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of HCoV and SARS-CoV transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as large as that of HCoV transmitted from the community.
On the other hand, it is necessary to verify whether or not the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV decreases after several transmissions between humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in polluted samples.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the vagina or urine like SARS-CoV plays a major role in transmission, at least in some circumstances, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, like HCoVs transmitted from the community, may be periodic or well.
However, SARS-CoV-2 features including transmissibility, congenital disease and persistent post-transmission spread from one individual to another will affect the ultimate fate of the current virus.
All four HCoVs transmitted from the community that produce mild symptoms of the disease have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be survivors of ancient HCoV allocations.
HCoVs that caused severe diseases in humans and people who developed severe HCoV diseases have now disappeared.
For this purpose, HCoVs should be sufficiently multiplied in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive movements that disrupt host limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people develop the disease, the more chances there will be for the virus to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus is adapted well, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans by carcinoma or other measures of infection control.
For several years, four outstanding CoVs have circulated in human communities, causing common colds in people with a healthy immune system.
These viruses do not need animal sources.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
These viruses need to be preserved and spread in their animal reservoirs and are on the lookout for opportunities to infect human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four HCoV acquired from the community.
This virus, like HCoVs transmitted from the community, has a high transmission capacity, at least for now.
However, its congenital disease is fewer than HCoV transmitted from the community and more than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We have to wait and see if the virus is fully adapted to humans and transmitted between humans without intermediary reservoirs or animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate hosts and transducers of HCoVs.
If the shelter animal is a nearby virus that has a high nucleotide cousin at the tubular level, that animal acts as an evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted in the host and is not a pathogen for it.
Similarly, a reservoir host continuously and for a long time shelters to HCoV.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host is HCoV or his father’s viruses.
On the contrary, if HCoV had an intermediate host before infecting humans, or roughly at the same time, it did not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal reservoir for human infection, and in the role of an infectant host by providing the possibility of the virus to proliferate temporarily and then transmit it to humans, increase the level of infection in humans.
If HCoV is unable to keep its transmission stable in the middle host, it can cause deadly infections.
Conversely, HCoVs can be compatible with intermediate hosts and even be present in the host group for a long time.
In this case, the medium host acts as a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data suggests that the first person to be infected with SARS has been in contact with red animals.
Further surveys of heart disease show that levels of immunoglobin G anti-Sars virus are higher in animal product vendors than in ordinary people.
For the first time, a number of larvae (Paguma larvata) and a racon dog were diagnosed on the live animal market carrying the SARS-CoV semi-virus that was almost one with SARS-CoV.
A 29-nocleotide removal specification for SARS-CoV has been found in races taken at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Meanwhile, it has been that wildlife residents or farms that were not available on the live animal market were mostly negative for the presence of the SARS-CoV virus. This suggests that wildlife is likely to be only an intermediate and exacerbating host, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV pathogens, so the possibility that many species of small mammals may also act as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are apparently the final hosts of SARS – CoV.
In the subsequent search for the body of the natural host animal SARS-CoV, a coronavirus type that was very similar to the coronavirus CoV and called the coronavirus HKU3 associated with SARS, horse fever (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) was found to live in the Chinese horse fever fever.
These specimens are positive for anti-SARS-CoV and for the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
The virus and other co-viruses have an 88 to 92 percent similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies gave rise to a new theory that says the hosts of new viruses are human-borne diseases.
A number of coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) were also detected in the shell, but none of them were separated as live viruses except WIV1.
Human angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, which was obtained from the spinal cord, showed that ACE2 is used by the spinal cord, the spinal cord, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the headaches of the recovered Sars patients had the ability to inhibit WIV1.
To date, WIV1 has been the closest outbreak of SARS-CoV, with a 95 percent nucleotic resemblance.
Although there is a lot of correlation between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is not the parent of the SARS-CoV infection, and the mice are the hosts of the SARS-CoV infection.
Phylogenetic analysis agglomerates MERS-CoV with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV-related RNA-dependent RNA polymers are phylogenically closer to beta-CoVs that have been identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wildlife.
The MERS-CoV virus and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, are only 87% similar to the nucleotide.
Therefore, the container can not be host to the MERS-CoV container.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that mountain frogs are positive in terms of MERS-CoV-specific anesthetic, which is also true for Middle Eastern frogs that live in African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, similar to a virus found in humans, was sampled from a mountain turtle’s nose and showed that turtles are real hosts of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
It should be noted that generally mild symptoms and very severe viral discharge have been observed in turtles who have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected mosquitoes spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the respiratory - oral tract, which is also considered the primary method of removing the virus in the vagina.
However, one of the questions that has remained unanswered since then is that in many cases confirmed by MERS, there was no history of contact with tiger before symptoms occurred, probably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is about 96.2% similar to the nucleotide tuberculosis to the CoV RaTG13 virus separated from the nasal tuberculosis.
Like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining parental relationship.
In other words, cysts can’t host a SARS-CoV-2 bacterial reservoir unless cysts are found to be almost identical in the future.
Probably, hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 transmitter virus, with many of the primary cases of Covid-19 seen in them, should be among the wild animals sold and killed on the Hunanbead seafood market, indicating a potential transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent studies based on metagenomic tissue show that a group of known-risk small mammals called manis javanica may also be a haven for ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The new genetic resemblance of the CoV-Pangulinum virus is approximately 85 to 92 percent similar to that of the nucleotide to SARS-CoV-2.
However, these viruses are associated with approximately 90% of the nucleotide tumor similarity as much as with RaTG13.
These viruses are clustered into two sub-families of SARS-CoV-2 semi-viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor connector range similar to SARS-CoV-2 and has a 97.4% identical amino acid content.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have more differences, though with greater degree of similarity than those of the genome.
In a previous study conducted on a patient’s ganglions, it was that fragments of the virus’ DNA were separated from lung samples that were closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of methods of obtaining and manual correction to create a portion of the genome that made up approximately 86.3% of the length of the virus’s genome.
We can’t rule out the possibility that Pangolin is one of the SARS-CoV-2 animal mediators.
However, there is currently no evidence that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is valid in pantholin, as there is between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-associated pantholin vagration.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the gap between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been obtained in caterpillars, pandulines and other mammals.
While the most toxic comrades have been observed in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genetic toxic comrades.
It is assumed that a high degree of similarity between beta-CoV RBDs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to co-selective evolution.
A different suggestion is a supporter of the re-combination of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 Pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Nutracybium, as a driving force in evolution, is common among beta-CoVs.
Judgments about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not ended.
Along with highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal derivatives of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are still under study.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV – NL63, and HCoV – 229 may have been derived from covarians, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV – HKU1 are found in genders.
It has been that the dark CoV called .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) is closely related to HCoV-NL63, seen in the three North American colours.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically related to another mutant CoV called Hipposideros/GanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while perfumes are also suspected of being the intermediate host of the virus.
To clarify, the existing knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for inter-species transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was discovered to be transmitted between different species to infect humans through insects, a pandemic of respiratory infections occurred.
The history of interspecular transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-CoV.
Numerous evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus from insects to humans.
First, humans, not Alpine humans, can communicate with alpine humans in a common ecological environment.
Instead, humans have close connections with the alpha.
Secondly, alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E are varied and non-diverse in the algae, while alpha-CoVs in alpha-CoVs cause the onset of respiratory disease in animals.
Ultimately, alpha-CoV alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, this possibility cannot be ruled out that alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E were received from humans.
In fact, spiders are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses such as Harri, Ebola, Nepa, and Indira viruses.
So it’s not surprising that spiders transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-CoVs act as the treasury of the HCoV-229E gene, alpaca and a mountain caterpillar may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as has been seen with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission from frogs to mountain frogs and from frogs to humans.
MERS-CoV’s evolutionary origins have been known from the very beginning of the detection of the virus, and subsequent findings have supported this theory.
It is clear that spiders provide a rich reservoir of viral species for genetic fragments exchange between species and transmissions between species.
Long life, busy colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly are all the conditions for a spy that makes him an ideal virus player.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been on the brink of a mountain for several decades.
The virus has adapted well to these frogs, and the frog has turned from a medium host to a stable, natural host.
MERS-CoVs are very mild disease-causing and have a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Invisible transmission of the virus to humans is a random occurrence and humans are the host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of the shellfish in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of Pangolin, if it plays a role in this case, is different in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, Pangolin beta-CoV in Pangolin is very severe.
These animals may be benchmarking hosts of beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, similar to those for SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, the scabies can be a host of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have an ecological place in common with the pine through the harvesting or extraction of coal.
Secondly, Pangolin may be one of the enhancing mid-hosts where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently entered.
Humans are infected by the virus by eating hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Animal and wildlife examination is essential.
Thirdly, as stated above, SARS-CoV-2 neuralgia and adaptation may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both caterpillars and pandulines.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the various types of host animals, three other factors on the virus side are also important for facilitating COVs’ crossing of existing barriers.
First of all, there is a relatively high rate of swing in their RNA proliferation.
The estimated shift rate in the CoV virus, with an average replacement rate equivalent to approximately 10-4 substitutions per year for each site 2, depends on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new host, which, compared to other monodisciplinary RNA viruses, can be considered "average" to "greater".
CoVs have a correction of the error exorbonuclease that its removal can lead to very high swings, meltdown, or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the proliferation of CoV by inhibiting the RNA-affiliated exosorbonoid and polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, CoVs are about a million times faster than their hosts.
In addition, the shift rate is high when the CoVs aren’t compatible well with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high fluctuation rate, the fluctuation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that the virus has now adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is true for MERS-CoV which is well-compatible with a mountain turtle.
In theory, it is far removed that genetic modification could quickly disrupt vaccines and antiviruses against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs creates excess flexibility in genome correction for genetic and neutrophilic variations, thereby increasing the likelihood of mutation between species that contributes to the emergence of new CoVs under suitable conditions.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions that are encoded to the ends of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change patterns at the time of RNA proliferation through a unique “copy-selection” mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixed tank, branch replacement occurs frequently at the time of CoV RNA resumption.
Subgenetic RNAs, wholly identical in length, can re-combine to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - OC43, as well as animal coVs such as bat - CoV and batCoV - HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural neurotransmitters has been found.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the virus’s interaction with the host receptor is another key factor affecting species-to-species transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV neuralgia is considered as a regular sample, showing evidence of positive selection during the interspecie transfer event.
Based on a comparative analysis between human separated samples and SARS-CoVs, it is assumed that SARS-CoV has rapid adaptation in different hosts, with a shift in RBD of S protein.
Generally, RBD in the CoV virus’s S protein interacts with the cell receptor and triggers an intense host anti-wave response.
In the SARS-CoV virus, it is found in the amino acids 318 to 510 and on fermentS1, which binds to human ACE2 and common receptors of the virus.
SARS-CoV virus RBD is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in various animals including caterpillars, cats, mice and raccoons, which provides the possibility of species-to-species transmission for the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids with human and celiac virus samples differ in RBD, and that 4 of them are located in the connector-receiver mothive to reconcile with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS – CoV-Cyot has K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the urge for soft protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid derivatives may be vital for viral adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has similar cell receptors to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein suggests that the tendency to bind S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows that there is a tendency of 10 to 20 for this bond between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether or not another common receiver is needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also be an explanation of the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after species-to-species transfer from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecular transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and restrictive factors.
The fluctuation of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as squirrels, mountain monkeys, and squirrels may create barriers to transition between species.
For a successful interspecies transfer, HCoV must control host-dependent factors and eliminate host-restrictive factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
Completely genetically impartial development of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
Discovering New HCoVs: From the Beginning
The diversity of coVs has provided extensive opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the coV acts as a reservoir for the HCoV gene.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic novelty also promote the evolutionary cycle of HCoV and act as two important stages in the process.
For example, acquiring or losing new protein-coding genes has the potential to dramatically alter viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV side proteins, the ORF8-protein is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, because after the separation of the SARS-CoV-associated viruses, it was found that the virus codes different ORF8-proteins.
The function of removing the Nocleotide-29-SARS-CoV virus was observed in separated swabs at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive shift that helps change hosts.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a possible neuralgia history with the alpha and gamma CoV ancestors, in which a large number of smaller neuralgia fields have been identified in RNA-affiliated RNA polymers.
Novatorial locations were identified in nsp9, nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV virus has been responsible for allocating, experiencing newcomers between different ancestors that occurred in the Arabian mountain mountains.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a novotrybial event has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in their unstructured genes.
It should also warn that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of viruses from selective pressure applied, for example by the host’s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the primary specimen of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although unhanded and complete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229 E-related viruses, alpha-CoV alpha-CoV leads to a change in frame with an additional single nucleotide.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure on their reservoir hosts.
There were no mild symptoms or symptoms when it was diagnosed that the veins were infected with CoVs, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and veins.
They appear to be well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in activating the pre-inflammatory response in the veins effectively reduces the damage caused by COVs.
Additionally, the activity of the natural killer cell in the tubes is suppressed due to the rearrangement of the retardant killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of tissue adaptation of large complex molecules of Class I.
In addition, the high levels of oxygen species (ROS) caused by the higher metabolic activity of the cysts can also suppress the proliferation of CoV and also affect the retardation of the exoskeletal effect, thereby providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when it enters a new host.
CoV breeds that are mostly pathogenic can lead to neuralgia, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for host adaptation.
So, it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are not infectious diseases or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as flies and flies.
These viruses proliferate dramatically without having to face a strong host security response.
Here is the mystery of why pregnancies are seen without signs of disease and what causes severe conditions in the human body.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and the cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in carriers without signs of disease, the immune response is distinct from CoV proliferation.
The strategy of separating the connection of immune system responses may have beneficial effects on treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
The interferon responses in the shells are strong.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation is stable.
With this argument, NLRP3 inhibition in conjunction with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of Quevid-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general article of events SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While SARS-CoV beta-CoV has a 95 percent nucleotide neighbor, there is also a 96 percent nucleotide beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2.
While the cows and other shelter market animals have been identified as SARS-CoV-like viruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted hosts have not yet been identified.
Beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pandolines may act as one of the intermediate hosts, or that beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally produced by humans.
CoVs have returned to focus due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in cattle and other animals has drastically changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and reservoirs of HCoV in transmission to humans.
Extensive evidence has shown that the originators of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and seals in seed markets, closing the marine animal market and killing seals could effectively end Sars disease.
In spite of the same argument, pandulines should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal-to-human transmission, which is due to the discovery of several cases of beta-CoV ancestors of pandulines that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarifying how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pandulines and other mammals to humans still requires future research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long existed in the rocks of a mountain.
These beetles are regarded as an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, butter and peanut products for the local people.
These birds are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
So it’s impossible to sacrifice all the bulls to control MERS, just like what was done in China’s wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS – CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to produce effective anti-MERS-CoV vaccines for turtles along with other pollution control criteria.
Because we are not able to remove these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease.
Many common coVs between humans and animals are circulating in the wild.
In particular, coVs are very diverse with the potential for transmission from animal to human.
There are many opportunities for these common coVs between humans and animals to grow and re-fuse, leading to the emergence of new coVs that are highly transmissible and intermittent.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be put aside to reduce unnecessary interaction between humans and animals.
With the tough test that SARS, MERS and Covid-19 had for us, we need to have a better plan for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs so that there is a chance to survive.
Although spiders have many features that help spread viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the likelihood of human contact with spiders and other species of wildlife can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts and will be useful in preventing animal infestation to humans and their species.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent common viruses between humans and animals is to keep humans away from the ecological activity of the natural reservoir of common viruses between humans and animals.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if the scabies have transmitted a SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to the pandemic, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the scabies and the pandemic could live together in a common ecological situation.
Second, if spiders played a direct role in the transmission to humans, how humans communicated with spiders.
Thirdly, if a third-party mammal has acted as a real mediator host, how it interacts with different species including humans, caterpillars, and ganglions.
And finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be prone to SARS-CoV-2, both care and experimental follow-up should be done.
Whether the animal concerned is a carnivorous, pangolin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be detected in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this field will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications in preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
Curve-19 diagnostics criteria for “suspicious resources” and “confirmed resources” must be updated.
On February 6, 2020, our team released the 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Rapid Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, a guide that provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the epidemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on advanced research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this article, we provided an overview of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious resources” and “confirmed resources” based on the latest Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment for Kuwait-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the outbreak of the disease now officially referred to as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), also known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2010, the World Health Organization declared Kuwait-19 a pandemic.
Our team created a quick guide to combating SARS-CoV-2 and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on progressive research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment approaches are constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Kuwait-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, has been published a total of seven times, with some texts being changed.
Now, Zhou and colleagues have provided an insight into our guide that includes a simple rating proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their article added new evidence to our guide and also provided a valuable reference to the pandemic worldwide.
We recognize and acknowledge their excellent work.
However, their articles should be updated in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh List) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspicious cases, one of the characteristics of the history of all contagious diseases must be combined with two cases of manifest clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if the history of all contagious diseases is lacking, it must meet three cases of manifest clinical symptoms:
All clinical history: (i) previous travel or stay in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of Kuveid-19 were within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (ii) history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (positive to nucleic acid testing); (iii) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory disease from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of Kuveid-19 were within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (iv) history of contact with confirmed clusters (frequency of more than 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (i) respiratory symptoms; (ii) imaged symptoms of Covid-19 infection; (iii) total number of white blood cells representing a normal, increased, decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stages of the disease.
Confirmed cases should be diagnosed on the basis of suspicious cases accompanied by one of the following cases or evidence of heart disease: (1) PCR-blasting test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2; (2) total virus genome variation showing high synergy with the new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies in the SARS-CoV-2 head test; or a change in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or an increase of more than 4 titer comparisons in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the PCR blasting test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020), and then heartfelt evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes were made based on the continuous work of researchers who were looking for an optimized nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis and also based on respiratory sampling including blood sampling, which led to greater access to various samples and supported the positive presence of specific antibodies in validated criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that warns us to be careful with abnormal symptoms and patients who lack symptoms.
Therefore, the Jo and colleagues chart should be updated, as in this flux, an individual who has no clinical symptoms is classified as “low-risk”.
The rating system should also be confirmed in practice and with more clinical studies.
To aggregate, we hope that more direct evidence and evidence will be presented and we want readers to provide their opinions.
To identify “suspicious resources” and “confirmed resources”, we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also regularly provide guidelines to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has five new deaths due to Kuwait-19, the highest daily figure ever.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Kuwait-19.
This was the highest number of daily deaths due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that the recorded cases of epilepsy included 114 active and 33 recovering cases resting at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said in an online news conference that the death toll included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 50 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic quo-19.
A hospital employee told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jair Sifour Rahman, one of the directors of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, which was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh’s Minister of Transport and Bridges, announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, more than originally planned.
The closure of public transport initially started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods – medical goods, fuel and food – continued.
The first case of Kuwait-19 was recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 by two passengers who had returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than one million people worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to Covid-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the confirmation of the first coronavirus case in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related deaths in Zambia, this day became a point of sympathy.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that it is one of the few countries free of coronavirus.
The World Health Organization 1,051,635 confirmed cases so far yesterday, of which 79,332 were related to twenty-four hours before ten in the morning at Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, leading to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, based on data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronavirus outbreaks on Wednesday.
Different countries around the world have taken more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city shutdown to 1 on Thursday.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that the wages of the Russian people will be paid throughout the country without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for another 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one against.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a limit of frequency in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina at all hours of the day; previously, the limit of frequency was only applied between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Thailand has planned to implement the frequency limit between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Mike DeWine, governor of Ohio, has announced that the state has extended domestic carnival regulations to 1.
Australian shops cut their shares of toilet clothes every time they buy
Woolworths and Coles stores in Australia reduced the restriction on the purchase of toilet clothes in all country-level stores to two and one package per purchase on Saturday and Sunday.
The ALDI store also announced a purchase limit on a package on Monday.
These restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of these chain stores.
According to reports, buyers are buying and storing because of the fear of the need for personal cartridges due to Kuwait-19.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths restricted the purchase of toilet towels for home delivery to one package for each order.
The changes continued to limit the four previous packages for each purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
The Coles store announced in its March 8 press release that despite a four-pack purchase limit, “the existence of many stores will end within an hour” and called this demand level “unprecedented,” the ALDI store also described on its Facebook page on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
According to Woolworths spokesman, sales experienced a “strong boost” last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to buy to two packages last week.
To reduce this shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery rates to stores, Woolworths has ordered more existing items.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase their assets, but local council restrictions on timing of freight delivery trucks have made it difficult.
He said he expects production costs to rise as suppliers try to meet demand and special sales drop.
On Tuesday, the ALDI store announced that some stores would not be able to hold a special sale on Wednesday due to early deliveries.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores fill their warehouses every night.
He added that the volume of toilet towels leads to the fact that the storage stock of the stores is small in number and when this product is finished, it leaves a lot of space in the cabinets and creates a feeling of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are a lot of products in the cage, where there are high numbers of products such as toilet clothes and anti-infectious agents, and there is the possibility of buying them, your fear and fear are likely to be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet clothes, announced on Wednesday that their existing was finished.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilets, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent toilets, insist that they work 24/7 to meet existing demand.
Domain.com, one of the most active real estate sites, that when fewer benefits were held due to shoppers’ holidays during the long working day holidays, some real estate sellers donated free toiletry to Melbourne’s first benefit offerers.
The Thursday edition of NT News, which is one of Darwin’s newspapers, had a special eight-bear letter to be cut and used as a toilet cloth.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, the stores in principle did not intend to impose restrictions and said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other items, including masks, anti-infectious agents, dry clothes, fluids and toilet soaps and soaps.
Outside Australia, the English online supermarket Ocado also saw a restriction on the purchase of Andres toilet clothes on Sunday night to two packs of 12 reels.
World Health Organization declares Kuwait-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the pandemic of the disease, which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word “pandemia” only refers to the extent of a disease, not the extent to which it is dangerous, the WHO has emphasized the need for governments to promote countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of this pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the WHO, said countries should prepare their people for diagnosis, testing, treatment, screening and tracking.
We are deeply concerned, both about the level of warning about the onset of the disease and its severity, and about the level of warning about inadequate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: “Out of the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked since its invention until the continuing global plague.
Ghebreyesus also said in a similar statement: “We’ve never seen pandemics created by a coronavirus before.”
He continued, “and we’ve never seen pandemics before that, at the same time, be controllable.”
The new pandemic was declared after the WHO in January declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency with international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about the prevalence of the disease: “The situation in the front line is getting worse.”
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of Kuwait-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 20-2019 is a progressive pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produced as a result of acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a public health emergency with international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of Kuwait-19 have been in 210 countries and territories, leading to approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated to be around 4%, while globally it varies from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, dizziness and shortness of breath.
Its complications may include alopecia and acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
The time between the virus entering the body and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when swallowing, staying away from other people, and personal monitoring and care for people who are suspected of getting infected.
Authorities across the world have reacted to the virus by imposing travel restrictions, carnival, military government, risk control at work and closing locations.
This pandemic has resulted in severe socio-economic disruptions, delay or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources that are aggravated by neural purchases.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have been closed either nationally or locally, affecting 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
False information about the virus has spread online, with cases of alien horror and discrimination against the Chinese people and other people of race and appearance in East and Southeast Asia, as well as other people from areas with a widespread spread of the virus.
Due to travel restrictions and heavy industry shutdowns, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) a group of illnesses with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and in early January 2020, research was launched in the field.
These cases were mainly related to the major market for seafood, which is why it is believed that the virus is of animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of this disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that has been closely linked to the coronavirus, coronavirus pandulinum and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first known person with the symptoms became ill on 1 December 2019 and that the person had no close connection to the next group related to the seafood market.
Of the initial cases in December 2019, two-thirds were related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that a case was tracked on November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man from the Hubei province who could be the first case. On February 26, 2020, WHO that despite a decline in cases in China, there has been a sudden rise in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases inside China.
The number of cases may be significantly lower than the number of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases of epilepsy had been among young people, and people aged 19 and under accounted for only 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, UK’s senior academic adviser, estimated that about 60% of the UK population should be affected in order to collective security effectively.
The case reference is the number of people who have tested for Quevid-19 and their tests have been announced on the basis of official positive protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have adopted official policies that do not test people with only mild symptoms.
The study, published on March 16, showed that by January 23, about 86% of cases of COVID-19 were undetected and unrecorded, accounting for 79% of cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of cases in Italy is significantly higher than the number of cases.
Preliminary estimates of the base load number (R0) for Quidditch-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that this number could be 5.7.
Most people with covid-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was between 6 and 41 days, and the most common period was 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, 97,000 deaths have been attributed to Kuwait-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years old, and 70% of them suffered from background diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of the number of deaths and illnesses caused by pandemic covid-19 generally point to deaths whose tests for covid, based on official protocols, were positive.
The actual number of deaths and deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as the figures may not include people who have died without testing – for example, at home, in nursing centers, etc.
Inadequate data from Italy showed that the number of untested deaths during the pandemic was about five to four times higher than the official statistics of deaths and deaths.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: “We know that [declared death rate] is less than the actual rate,” which is consistent with unofficial reports based on fewer outbreaks of statistics in the U.S. Such actions often occur in pandemics, including in all cases of H1N1 swine flu in 2009. The first confirmed deaths occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first deaths outside China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first deaths outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and government territories on all continents except the South Pole of Death and Mercury were.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time and are influenced by the extent of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time spent from primary pregnancy and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and general health status.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate by 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (for people who started their symptoms from 10-1 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who started their symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case-death rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of identified based people who die as a result of a disease, and the disease-death rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of affected (identified and unidentified) people who die as a result of a disease.
These statistics have no time limit and follow a specific population from the beginning to the resolution of the case.
Several scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The evidence-based Medical Center of the University of Oxford estimates that the disease death rate for the pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results obtained from the first randomized Quevid-19 trial in Germany, as well as a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the trial on the estimate of CFR.
The WHO says the pandemic is controllable.
The final duration of the infection cannot be stated with certainty and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: “Common infectious relapses, if actions are not taken to control them, usually stabilize and begin to decrease when the disease gets out of hosts.
But at the moment, it is impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries struggle to implement the World Health Organization’s recommendations on measures to combat the outbreak, “the disease could end by June.”
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Thermal Health and Medicine announced on March 17 that SARS-CoV-2 “probably will be in circulation for one or two years.”
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College, physical detachment and other measures “will be necessary until a vaccine is made (probably taking 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think the probability that this coronavirus will completely disappear is low – because it’s easily transmissible” and “it could turn into a periodic disease that returns every year.”
The severity of this return will depend on the mass and intensity of the movement.
Covid-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and people who are affected may be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry fever (68%).
Symptoms that have less pain include fatigue, breast production, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremors, streaks, elevated blood, cough and cyanosis. The World Health Organization has that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, feeling pain or persistent pressure in the chest, sudden distress, difficulty waking up, swelling of the face and lips; in the event of these symptoms, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some people may have no symptoms, have no clinical symptoms, but the results confirm their prevalence, so researchers have recommended that people who have had close contact with people with the disease should be closely monitored and tested to prevent their infection.
Estimates made by China have varied from very low amounts to 44% for the rate of people with symptoms.
The usual period of stagnation (time between the onset of an individual to the onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the statistics of the portion of people with Covid-19 who lose their sense of smell were initially 30% but subsequently decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is occurring are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is mainly caused by close contact and by small particles produced by whispering, thirsting or talking; and close contact means a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that uncovered drilling can spread small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) and 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some studies have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small particles that are produced by speaking and remain in the air for longer periods of time.Al the virus is not generally fluid, respiratory residue particles can be produced by breathing, including speaking.
These particles can enter the mouth or nose of neighbors or pass through the breath to their lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as respiratory tubing and rheumatoid cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR), can lead to airborne respiratory pulses splashing and resulting in hypertension.
The disease is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface including the skin and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of transmission of the disease through flu, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although it is also possible to transmit the disease before the onset of symptoms and subsequent stages of the disease, the highest incidence of the virus is in the first three days of the onset of symptoms.
People whose test results were positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission of the disease before the onset of significant symptoms is possible.
There are few reports of missing symptoms that have been confirmed by the laboratory, but unsymptomatic transmission has been identified during communication tracking research, by some countries.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said that although it is unclear how quickly the disease spreads, one person can usually infect two or three others.
Specifically, the virus has been identified to survive up to three days on the surface of plastic (propylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on the surface and up to a maximum of four hours on the surface.
However, these amounts can vary depending on humidity and temperature. So far, cases of being positive have occurred in animal and other animal trials for Quidditch-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, just like when they are in contact with other levels that may have been touched by infected people.
Acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first identified in three people with alopecia who were in contact with a group of people with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the corona of related viruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap that destroys its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that the virus is of animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically derived from the beta-caronavirus, a subtype of the sarcoma virus (Ncell B), along with two genes derived from the scabies.
At the overall genome level, the virus corresponds to 96 with other samples of coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that between the pandulines and humans, there is only one amino acid in certain sections of their genome.
Complete genomic comparisons so far have concluded that up to 92% of genetic material is shared between coronavirus pancolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pancolin is an intermediate host.
Infection with the virus, temporarily, can be diagnosed by symptoms, however, final confirmation is carried out by rRT-PCR or CT imaging.
Research comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time is less specific because many of the CT imaging features are associated with other inflammatory lung diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “CT should not be used as a screening or primary test to diagnose Covid-19.”
The World Health Organization has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
This test uses the momentum polymerized renovating chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of these tests are usually seen within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this experiment is performed with a nasopharyngeal sword, however, a throat sword can also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these methods were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological trial developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by some accredited laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging in radiography and computer tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include unparalleled large glass patterns and the absence of lateral burden.
The Italian Society of Radiology is gathering an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Non-PCR-approved imaging, due to co-existence with other infections such as adenovirus, cannot be used specifically for the identification of COVID-19.
A major study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and found that although imaging is less specifically used to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive, and suggested it should be used as a therapeutic tool in areas with allergies.
Complex neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the imaging properties of the virus by both radiography and CT.
Some methods to prevent the transmission of the disease include proper personal health care, washing hands, touching the eyes, nose or mouth with sitting hands, and taking handcuffs when swallowing or stinging, and putting the handcuffs directly into the garbage.
Those who have previously suffered from the disease are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
It is also recommended to adhere to the regulations on physical removal to prevent the transmission of the disease.Many governments have not banned or recommended unnecessary trips to countries or territories where the disease is common.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has reached a social stage.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some people do not know where or how they have been infected. For people who provide health care for potential infected persons, it is recommended to follow standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Call tracking is one of the important practices for health authorities to identify the source of contamination and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps are created or proposed to be used voluntarily, and by 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are trying to find solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record how close users are to other mobile phones.
Users are then notified if they are in close contact with a person with CVD-19.Many misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; such as washing the nose or washing the mouth with the mouthwash are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are trying to build a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for Covid-19.
In order to prevent the disease, washing hands is recommended.
The CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or times when the hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying the nose, swallowing or craving.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with homemade soap, which destroys its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based anti-fertilizers with a minimum of 60% alcohol volume when soap is not readily available.
The World Health Organization recommends people to refrain from touching their eyes, nose and mouth with sitting hands.
Removal of pollution from the level is possible by various methods (one minute exposure to antifungal agents for the level of the stainless steel), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropylene, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betaine.
Other methods, including benzeconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of Kuwait exists in a building such as a work office or a day-to-day care centre, all sections such as offices, health services, common areas, common electronic devices such as tablets, touch pages, keyboards, remote controls and automatic devices used by sick people should be anti-infectious.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses with their clothes or towels when they are swallowed or thirsty, and remove the towels immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing masks can reduce the volume and distance of particles thrown out that are spread while speaking, stinking or whispering.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on how and when to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing masks can reduce people’s desire to touch their faces, which is one of the most important sources of illness if hand health is not observed.”
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for people with CVD-19, however, they also confirm that wearing masks helps people avoid losing their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of medical masks for one-time use by healthy people in the community, especially when they have close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or stopping in busy places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to use clothes to make masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited people from going out and attending assemblies without wearing masks or covering their mouth and nose.
On March 16, Vietnam called on all people to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made it mandatory to wear masks for those visiting grocery stores.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear masks when attending the gathering.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks every day since mid-March, has forced passengers on trains and inter-city buses to wear masks from April 1.
Panama has compelled people to wear masks when they go out and advised those who can’t buy masks to make home masks themselves.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social detachment (also known as physical detachment) involves pollution control measures that are carried out with the aim of slowing the spread of disease while minimizing close interpersonal connections.
These practices include carnival; travel restriction; school and workplace vacancies, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can practice these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, refraining from attending busy areas, greeting and interrogating without contact and physically distancing themselves from others.
Currently, many governments have imposed or recommended social detachment in areas affected by the disease.
The maximum recommended number of people gathered by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 (if there was no disease outbreak in the region) to 50 and subsequently to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people. Elderly people and those with background diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure and immune system failure are at greater risk of developing severe disorders and complications, and the CDC has recommended that these categories of people stay at home as much as possible in areas where the disease has found out in the community. By the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began to replace the term "social disintegration" with "physical disintegration", to clearly show that the aim of this is to reduce physical connections whileining social relationships, both virtually and remotely.
The use of the term "social excitement" instead of encouraging people to maintain relationships using alternative methods, indicated the concept that individuals should enter a complete social exclusion. Some officials issued guidelines in the field of sexual health for use during this phenomenon.
These guidelines included recommendations about having sex only with someone you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected, a personal home screening is recommended.
Health organizations have defined detailed guidelines for proper personal carnitine.Many governments have mandated or recommended personal carnitine for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The most stringent personal carcinogenic guidelines are issued for those in risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people with HIV/AIDS and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has been widely found, are advised to follow a personal carnival for 14 days from the time of their last contact.
The strategies for controlling the onset of a disease include inhibition, suppression and reduction.
Impairment in the early stages of the epidemic is carried out with the aim of tracking and segregating people affected, as well as introducing other measures for disease control and vaccination to stop the epidemic to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are shifted toward a reduction strategy: actions are taken to reduce the rate of illness and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
A combination of impediment and reduction actions can be carried out simultaneously.
Suppression requires more stringent measures to deter pandemics by reducing the base overload to less than 1.In addition to managing the outbreak of an infectious disease, an effort is made to reduce the overload known as the erosion clearance.
This reduces the risk of excessive pressure on health services and gives more time to produce and develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medicinal interventions that can help manage the outbreak of the disease include personal preventive measures such as hand health, wearing masks, personal carnage; social measures aimed at physical separation including shutting down schools and cancellation of events where there is a large number of people gathering; social involvement to encourage acceptance and observance of these interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning up the surface. When the highest severity of the disease was identified in China, more severe measures were taken to prevent it, including carnage of entire cities and enforcing strict travel bans.
Other countries have also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
Southwest Korea carried out a group and local carnival and issued warnings on trafficking of affected people.
Singapore considered financial support for people who carnage themselves and imposed severe penalties for those who do not.
Taiwan increased mask production and imposed penalties for the occupation of medical devices. Simulations carried out for Britain and the United States show that strategies for reducing (removing the expansion of everything rather than stopping it) and suppressing (removing the growth of everything) face great challenges.
Optimistic reduction policies could reduce health care demand by two-thirds and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and excessive pressure on the health system.
Suppression may be a better strategy, but it should beined as long as the virus is in circulation in the human population (or as long as the vaccine is prepared, if this happens earlier), because if measures are omitted, the level of infection quickly returns to the previous level.
Long-term intervention to suppress this pandemic creates social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for Quevid-19, though efforts are underway to build it, including testing existing drugs.
Using medications without the need for colds, drinking liquids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, varicose fluid injection and respiratory aid devices may be required.
Using steroids can make the situation worse.
Several of the compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being examined for use in the treatment of COVID-19.

Many Koreans signed lawsuits to explain Moon for what they called a bad administration of the government, and some others admired his reaction.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the disease could allow governments to take more power.
Hungarian parliament has allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to personally draft legislation indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish those who appear to have spread misinformation about the virus and how the government manages the crisis.
Coronavirus outbreaks are considered the main cause of several cases of resource shortages due to increased use of equipment to cope with the outbreaks of the disease, neurological purchases and disruptions in logistical operations and workshops.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disorders.
Several locations have also witnessed nerve shopping, which leads to emptying cages of essential supplies such as food, toilet clothes and mineralized water, causing a sense of resource shortage.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, director of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This level of demand has resulted in prices rising to twenty times the normal price and delayed delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the World Health Organization has warned that it will put healthcare workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity has resulted in a shortage of dry milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high Covid-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and its consistently high demand for food, both areas have been left behind with severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy have been successful in combating the illegal acquisition and sale of essential products and prevented the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant shortage of agricultural products, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, food boxes were rarely seen empty, and Chinese government officials put stockpiles of pork on the market to ensure people were properly fed.
There are similar rules in Italy that require food producers to have inventories for such emergencies.
The damage to China’s global economy has been felt: According to media reports on March 16, China’s economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020, due to measures taken by the government to reduce the outbreak of the virus and sharply reduce retail sales by 20.5%.
As China’s mainland is one of the world’s major economies and production poles, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist’s Data Unit has predicted that markets will remain unstable until a clearer picture of the potential consequences of the current situation is clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the epidemic’s negative economic consequences on global growth could be greater than the consequences of the 2004-2002 SARS.
One of the experts at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimates a negative impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is “rebounding” following a sharp drop in oil prices due to declining demand from China.
World stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant rise in cases of Kuwait-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock exchange indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced their worst fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1191 units, the biggest drop in a single day since the 2008-2007 economic crisis.
All three indicators ended the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s high credit rating but retained its negative view.
Stock markets fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many are aware of the potential economic downturn.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economist, praised urgent and timely action by central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel bans, shutdowns in public spaces, including tourist attractions, and recommendations from governments to refrain from any travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors that suffered the most.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled their flights due to declining demand, and British Regional Airlines Flybe was shut down.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise ship industry have been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ports were also closed.
This all coincided with Chunyun, which is one of the main seasons of travel and associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
A number of events, including New Year’s festivals that attended large numbers of people, were cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland also independently shut down their shops and tourist attractions.
Many New Year’s events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions, have been shut down to prevent crowds from gathering.
In 24 cases out of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions in China, officials extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of dealing with infectious diseases to its highest level and declared a state of emergency, shut down schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations.
Visits to retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East witnessed a 60-50% drop in reviews.
The outbreak of the disease also led to a 43-33% decrease in walking traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Examiners of major shopping centers around the world have taken other steps including improving health, installing blood scans to check the body temperature of buyers and cancelling events.According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the recession created by the pandemic could bring between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty that would not have been created for them without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the Wuhan pandemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million rural migrant workers were imprisoned, in domestic provinces in their homes or in the province of Hobby. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the forecasts of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could damage 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could rise to 32%. Holidays in India have led to unemployment of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid daily). A survey conducted by the Angus Reid Foundation found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme.
Germany’s short-term compensation plan has also been implemented by France and Britain.
The sectors of the performance arts and cultural heritage have also been deeply damaged by this pandemic, as well as the operations and human resources of relevant organizations – both active and independent – worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have strived to continue their mission (which is often funded by government funds) in providing access to cultural heritage, safeguarding their employees and supporting artists where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions around the world and to varying degrees were closed for an unidentified period and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
Instead, a lot of efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another consequence of the disease, which has recently accelerated rapidly, is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, major sports events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held during the last week of the Christian season of Lent and Repentance.
Many sedentary priests have advised elderly Christians to stay at home on Sundays instead of attending the ritual; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online or television, and others have made it possible to attend the ritual by car.
The Roman Catholic clergy closed their churches and monasteries, and St. Peter's Square was empty from Christian inhabitants, other religious institutions also cancelled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and barracks.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced Friday the cancellation of prayer in areas affected by the Ebola, and the mosques were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign visitors and residents from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption in the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 20-2019 Champions League, the 20-2019 Premier League, the 2020 Euro, the 20-2019 NBA season and the 20-2019 NHL season have either been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak hit the 2020 Summer Olympics program, which was scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event “will be re-planned for history beyond 2020, maximum for the summer of 2021”.Casinos and other gaming centers around the world have been closed and live poker competitions have either been cancelled or postponed.
This has caused many gamblers to bring online sites, many gambling sites have a significant increase in the rate of their registrations.The entertainment industry has also been hurt and many music groups have suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also suspended all shows.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artwork over the Internet as a substitute for traditional live performances, including live-streaming concerts or creating web-based “satellites” for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.
In the online space, many Internet monkeys have spread with the coronavirus theme so that many of them deal with various issues among the existing uncertainty.
Since the Kuwait-19 era, there has been an increase in discrimination, alien horror and racism against the Chinese and East Asian peoples, as well as those in disease zones in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Oceania region, cases of fear, misconception and hostile behavior have been observed.
Reports from February (while most cases were still limited to China) showed a rise in racist feelings in various groups around the world about whether the Chinese people are worthy of the virus or are experiencing punishment.
Some countries in Africa also witnessed rising anti-Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hobby have discrimination based on their regional headquarters.
There has been support from the Chinese people, both online and offline, from those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the disease to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience severe Kuwait-19 outbreak, were also exposed to misunderstanding and alien horror. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea in an effort to stop the outbreak, initially signed bans to ban Chinese citizens from entering their country.
In Japan, ChineseDontComeToJapan# became more popular on Twitter.
Chinese followers, as well as other Asians in Britain and the United States, have increased rates of racist insults and attacks against themselves.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for naming the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term used by racist and anti-Chinese critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign escorts who were evacuated from Wuhan and moving to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, which has a border with China and were studying in major Indian cities, experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, chairman of the Bharatiya Janata party’s state section in West Bengal, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and “therefore, God has avenged them.”
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Cologne and called "false."In China, the pandemic sparked terror, alienity and racism against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners were called "foreign occupation" and targeted by "destruction".
Many money-sharing newspapers have removed share fees for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the prevalence of the disease freely available.
Some scientists quickly shared their findings on servers for pre-release versions such as bioRxiv.

Tests for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and pathogens produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR that detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and only detects SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Pathology diagnosis (serology) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
The Padden test shows how many people had the disease by counting people who had very mild symptoms and did not report or had no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, accurate disease mortality rates and collective level of insecurity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the incidence rate of the disease in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large differences in the number of tests carried out between countries.
This difference is likely to affect a significant amount of case mortality that is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
The experiment, which uses the momentum RRT-PCR, could be carried out on breathing samples taken in a variety of ways, such as nasopharyngeal or mixed samples.
The results of these tests are usually seen within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swallow only gives reliable results in the first week of the disease.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while multiplying in the lungs.
For infected individuals who are tested in the second week, replacement samples may be taken from the depth of the respiratory tract by a catheter, or there may also be the possibility of using material derived from exfoliation.
One of the first PCR test samples was created in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin using the instantaneous polymerase resonance chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the base for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, created a clinical diagnostic kit for SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency approval for the use of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based diagnostic kit from the National Organization of Medical Products of China. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) is distributing the RT-PCR new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) momentary diagnostic panel among public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic trials in previous versions of the test kit resulted in non-stop results due to stable findings and limitations at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February, on average.
By February 28, 2020, experiments using two components were not reliable, and it was then that state and local laboratories found permission to experiment.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, under emergency use license.U.S. commercial laboratories began conducting the trial in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based Quevid-19 trials will be available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics has similarly made the Kuwait-19 test available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
There is no restriction on the number of tests; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the KOVID-19 test kit was carried out by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the trial was registered by the Federal Service Center for Health and Treatment Monitoring. On March 12, 2020, it was that Mayo Clinic had created a trial for Queved-19 disease. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA approval for a trial that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in high volume, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 trials over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories an Emergency Use License (EUA) for the m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar licenses for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EEA license from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved a trial that uses isothermal boosting of nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of rotating cycles, this method can deliver a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Currently around 18,000 of these devices are available in the U.S., and Abbott expects to be able to deliver 50,000 tests per day with increased production. An experiment using monoclonal padden that is specifically connected to the new coronavirus nucleotid protein (N-protein) is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid flu test.
A review of the research conducted in March 2020 concluded that “radiographic images of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings [computer tomography] can be detected even before symptoms appear.”
Common features in CT include a multi-pipe secondary matte glass curve with a lateral, non-comparative and rear distribution.
With the progression of the disease, sub-western supremacy occurs, stable coverage and severe severity.
Research that compares PCR with CT at Wuhan, which is the current pandemic principle, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and, at the same time, is less specific because many of the CT imaging features are associated with other lung inflammatory diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that “CT should not be used as a screening or primary test to diagnose COVID-19.”As of March 2020, the CDC is proposing a PCR method for primary screening.
Part of the immune system’s response to this infection is to produce pathogens such as IgM and IgG.
These pathogens can be used to diagnose infection in people after 7 days or more of symptom onset, immunity diagnosis and population monitoring.This test can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through patient clinical trials (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the amount of production of each system.
For CLT, a sample of surrounding blood is typically used, although several solid samples may be used to track the immune system's response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by splashing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-trial extraction phase is not required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 institutions that had been informed to the organization as requested and thus were now able to distribute their trials.
As of April 7, 2020, only one trial was approved by the FDA under emergency license. In late March 2020, the medical diagnostic laboratory Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics earned European certification for their test kits. These kits were able to identify IgG and IgA pathogens that were injected against the virus and were present in a blood sample.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the PCR test for viral RNA detection.
These patches are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the UK realized that none of the patch test kits they purchased were properly used.
Hong Kong has implemented a scheme according to which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency room will give the patient a sampling tube," the patient drops his mouth in it and returns it and receives the test results a while later. NHS UK has announced that it is conducting a schematic trial to take a test of suspicious cases at home that eliminates the risk of infecting others if the patient visits the hospital as well as if the ambulance is used and it needs to be discharged. While the possibility of entering a vehicle for the test of suspicious cases in Kuwait-19 provides, a health care professional, following appropriate precautions, takes a sample action.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians announced on March 2 that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day on the planet and last week, 10,700 people were tested.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are paid by health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, chairman of the Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Starting March 19th, it will be possible to test cars in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested by the end of the 12/2020 week, and the result of 33,491 samples (6.9%) was positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing 64 patient samples simultaneously, they did this by combining samples and then performing more tests only if the combined sample result was positive.In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostic laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼 or "Fire Eye") was opened by BGI that has the capacity to process 10,000 samples per day.
Construction of the laboratory took 5 days and was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, modeling showed that if this experimental capacity was not exploited, the number of cases in the Wuhan would be 47% more and the costs associated with the cartridge would double.
Similar samples from the Wuhan Laboratory, called the Huo-Yan Laboratories, were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 trials per day. The open-text and compound designs released by Origami Experiments could test samples of 1,122 patients using only 93 Quevid-19 test kits. These balanced designs are applicable in small labs and without the need for a fluid rocker.
By March, deficiencies and insufficient cognitive material had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in Europe, the UK and the United States.
This has led some authors to review sample preparation protocols, which include samples heating up to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes, to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing a large number of its country's population for coronavirus, which is more prevalent than any other country and thus is successful in achieving the trial of a large portion of its country's population.
This is possible due to the ability to test with vehicles and purchase a large laboratory on the scale of the country's total population from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency diagnostic laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory on this scale to operate outside of China.
Various test instructions that target different sections of the coronavirus genetic specification have been produced in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to prepare and ship kites to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce domestic kites.
The German Test Kit Guidelines were released on 17 January 2020. Since the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, the reason for the delay was the start of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the level of reliability of early test kits, and these countries, along with Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and cases recommended by health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say the availability of extensive trials in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The test capacity, mostly in private-sector laboratories, has been built over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for enhanced trial programmes as the best way to slow the progression of pandemic pandemic Covid-19. The high demand for trials due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of trials in private laboratories in the United States to be postponed and soap inventory and chemical evidence to be degraded.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the experimental kits produced by CDC had a "deficit". The government then removed bureaucratic barriers to conducting private experiments. Spain bought the experimental kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not correct.
The company explained that incorrect results could result in problems collecting samples or misuse of kits.
The Spanish Minister announced that he would not use kits that provided false results and would replace them with different test kits produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China received false results.
Prime Minister Matevich proposed that these kits be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said: “The test kits that Turkey has purchased from China have had a “high error rate” and they were “not ordered to be used.”The British government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that these kits were unusable.
The trial followed by carcinating people who were positive and tracking those who were associated with people with SARS-CoV-2-positive outcomes.
The researchers working in the city of Tuscany, where the first deaths of Covid-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two cycles of trials at a 10-day interval on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of those who tested positively had no symptoms and all positive cases were carcinogenic.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections were completely eliminated.
With severe tracking of callers, restriction, testing and carnival of entry passengers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much slower developed than other countries, but without severe restrictions such as compulsory shutdowns of restaurants and retail centers.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened after the holidays, on March 23 and at their scheduled time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by strictly tracking callers, limiting, testing and quarantining entry passengers, though with fewer holidays.
A statistical study showed that countries that performed more trials had much lower mortality rates, probably because they were better able to diagnose those who had only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have test capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in the field of Kuwait-19 send their five first positive and ten first negative samples to one of the 16 World Health Organization reference laboratories for approval.
Of these, 16 are reference laboratories, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% positive compared to total tests" column is influenced by the test policy of each country.
If all other conditions were the same, “% positive over total tests” would be higher in a country that tests only those admitted to hospitals compared to a country that tests all citizens on whether they have symptoms or well.
Hand washing, also known as hand health, is the process of cleaning a person’s hands to eliminate soil, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap continuously in “sensitive realities” during the day prevents the onset of many diseases, such as measles and vesicles that are transmitted through the stomach.
For example, if people don’t wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. facial gums), they may develop respiratory diseases such as flu or cold.
Five important situations during the day where washing hands with soap is important are: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby or replacing his cloth, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap is not available, hands can be cleaned with soap.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after eating.
Before and after treatment of the patient.
After replacing the cushion or cleaning the child after using the toilet.
After finishing, swallowing or swallowing.
After touching animals, animal feeding or feeding animals.
Health, apart from medical view, refers to health measures related to medical practices.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent the onset of a disease or minimize its transmission.
The primary purpose of medical handwashing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogenic microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people who work with food or in medical-related professions, but it is also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the onset of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing cough infections; and reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce the death rate of infants at home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices may lead to slight improvement in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, mortality from respiratory diseases and infertility in children can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote laundry can reduce cough cases by about a third, comparable to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap as an automatic behavior that has become commonplace in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only, most effective and cheapest way to prevent cough and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Alergia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years of age, causing the death of about 1.8 million children each year.
Tuberculosis and herpes, together, cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before meals and after use of the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, halve the number of deaths from colds and reduce the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of water, health and cleaning (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against gallbladder infections that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful but minor effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin and consequently damage to the skin.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that overwashing hands can lead to scabies, also known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is very common, especially among healthcare workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also known as one of the symptoms of OCD.
Five important times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce gastrointestinal-fat disease transmission are: after going to the bathroom (rarely, overwhelmed), after cleaning the child (replacement of the wipes), before feeding the child, before eating and before and after cooking or touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other cases where proper hand washing should be taken care of in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treatment of scratches or wounds, after scratching, scratching or finishing; after touching animal clothes or hands on animals; and after contact with garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7 percent of households have become accustomed to handwashing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of handwashing with soap, 97 percent; the United States is in the middle class with 77 percent and China is in the lowest class with 23 percent. There are currently several ways to change behavior to increase the rate of handwashing with soap at critical times. Group handwashing for school children at specific hours of the day is one of the options in developing countries to teach children how to wash their hands.
The Basic Health Care Program, implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines, is an example of extensive measures to promote the level of health and education in children.
Brushing hands twice a year, combined with daily handwashing with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is the main focus of the national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water is effective in removing microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins that are abundant in organic soil are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of enough water helps in cleaning.
Due to its reusable nature, solid soap can retain bacteria from previous seeds.
A handful of studies that paid for the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer of bacteria seems to be distant because the bacteria are washed with a bat.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that “liquid soap that is accessible without direct contact is better.”
Antibacterial soaps are widely promoted for people who care about health.
To date, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of antimicrobials or ginseng in destroying antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which are resistant to a wide variety of organisms.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant species were not supposed to be destroyed with antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are promoted on the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, may contain acids (esthetic acid, scorpionic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other softeners (algae vera, vitamin, transfolium, plant extract). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that regular soap is as effective as regular antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and destroying bacteria by hand.
Warm water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot water with soap compared to cold water with soap is more effective in eliminating natural oils that contain soil and bacteria.
However, and contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Anti-infectious agent is a non-blue health substance.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcoholic hand health products (also known as alcohol-based antiseptic or hand-based antiseptic) gained popularity.
Most of these are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol together with a detergent such as carbonate (acrylic acid polymer) and as a gel, or use a detergent such as glycerin for ease of use and reduction of the alcohol drying effect and are made in a liquid or coupe form.
The addition of compressed hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Anti-infestants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective microbial killers.
Alcohol-containing anti-infectious agents destroy bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), celiac disease and some viruses (including HIV, fever, RSV virus, rhinovirus, bovine flu, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Antifungal agents containing 70% of the total, 30 seconds after use, cause the destruction of 99.97% (minimum 3.5 logs equivalent to a decrease of 35 dB) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, cause the destruction of 99.99% to 99.999% (minimum 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand-based anti-infectious drugs are almost ineffective against neural viruses (or Norwalk viruses) which are the most common cause of diarrhea.A sufficient amount of hand-based anti-infectious agents or alcohol-containing gels should be used so that both hands are completely washed or covered.
The back and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers should be soaked for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries out.
The fingernails should also be washed well by tapping on both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than the use of anti-infectious drugs, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
The use of these substances is due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly eliminate microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand pesticides can cause dry skin unless softeners or moisturizers are added to their formulation.
Adding glycerin or other softeners to their formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand anti-infectious agents that contained alcohol and softeners caused much less burn and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact ulcer syndrome or sensitivity to alcohol or additives contained in alcohol-containing hand antioxidants are rare.
A lower likelihood of developing contact irritation compared to washing hands with soap and water made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based substances do not clean hands of organic matter, but rather protect them against infection.
That’s why hand pesticides are not as effective in preventing the onset of many diseases as soap and water, because pathogens still remain on your hands.
The effect of alcohol-free hand anti-infestants is heavily dependent on their ingredients and formulation and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing anti-infestants.
Recently, formulations that use benzeconium chloride have been shown to have more cumulative and continuous antimicrobial activity after use, as opposed to alcohol, which decreases its effectiveness after frequent use, probably due to skin negative reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to make soap and use grain or soil instead.
Grass or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may have less effect compared to soap.
One concern is that if the soil or grain is contaminated with microorganisms, it may, instead of reducing the spread of the disease, on the contrary, increase its appearance.
Grapefruit, like soap, is an anti-infectious agent because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends grapefruit or peanut as a substitute for soap.
The right hand washing methods recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot water.
Running water is recommended for the reason that rocked water may be contaminated. This is while the water temperature does not appear to cause any change.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates microbes on the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using only water.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Melting your hands creates spotting and helps remove the microbes from the skin, and soaking your hands for longer, destroys more microbes.
Wash your hands with water.
Washing in roasted water can infect your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and dirty hands can easily become infected.Most of the parts of the hand that are left sitting are the washing finger, the palm of the hand, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cut nails may be hidden by microorganisms.
Moisturizing creams are often recommended to prevent drying of hands.Dry skin leads to skin injury and can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
There are various low-cost options for facilitating handwashing in developing countries where piping water or soap is not available. For example, pouring water out of a gallon or a hole container or using grass if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for saving water consumption, such as "type tap or small water milks" and other low-cost options.
A tap is a simple technology that is made from a container that is wrapped with a thread and a foot-controlled tap to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand health process, but there are debates about the most effective form of drying hands in public toilets.
A growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much healthier than the electric dryers that are available in many toilets.
In 2008, a study sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Textile Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the health benefits of paper towels, hot air dryers, and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying your hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in your fingertips increased by an average of 194 percent and the bacteria in your hands 254 percent.
Drying hands with a jet air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the tip of the fingers by 42% and on the tip of the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the tip of the fingers and 77% on the tip of the hands.The researchers also conducted experiments to determine whether there is a possibility of mutual transmission of contamination to other users of the toilet and the washing environment due to the use of different methods of drying hands.
The jet air dryer, which allegedly pulls out air at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km or 400 miles per hour), has been able to stifle microorganisms from hands and devices and potentially contaminate others using the toilet as well as the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a hot air dryer can disperse microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause a significant release of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of drying hands were examined.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers and hand dryers are compared to hand dryers with paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water while traveling, washing hands with hand gloves can be used as a replacement.
Alcohol-based hand infection should have at least 60% alcohol.
Long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed the effect of handwashing (in 1846) in preventing the onset of disease in the hospital environment, medical handwashing became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind them if the hospital staff forgot to wash their hands.
One study showed that the rate of infection was reduced with their use.
The time required for medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds, using sufficient amount of soap and water or gel and soaking all parts of the hands.
The hands must be wrapped and the fingers cut together.
If there is a scratch underneath the nails, a scratch can be used to remove it.
Since microbes may remain in the blue that is on the hands, it is very important that the hands are well watered and dried with a clean towel.
After drying hands, a paper towel should be used to close the water milk (and if necessary to open the exit door).
This prevents the re-contamination of the hands due to contact with that level.
The goal is to wash hands in treatment centers, eliminate the microorganisms of the disease ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Medical Journal reports that handwashing is unacceptable in most hospital settings, so many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, causing microorganisms to pass on.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple practices can account for up to 66 percent of the rate of blood circulation pollution that cataracts play a role in. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standard method of handwashing and handwashing in healthcare sectors.
The hand health guide prepared by the organization on its website is also available to the public.
A related survey was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If necessary to demonstrate compliance with specified regulations, commercial devices can measure and verify the level of hand health.
The World Health Organization has defined five times for washing hands:
After exposure to blood or body pressure.
Before doing work related to anti-inflammation, and
Adding anti-infectious chemicals to the soap (the "dark" or "microbial" soap) enhances the detoxifying properties of the washing agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To wash hands before surgery, the following requirements are required: water milk that can open and close hands without direct contact, some chlorhexidine or iodine dryer, sterilized towels for drying hands after washing them, and specially washed sterilized sheets and other sterilized items for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
In this procedure it is necessary to wash the hands and help the arsenic for usually 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time.
When the water is drained, it is necessary to prevent the water from returning to the hand.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and the surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an anti-infectious agent before and after taking care of the patient.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been determined that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is obtained from the first 20% of washing, and when the turnover of cleaning hands reaches more than 35%, it has very few additional benefits.
Washing hands with regular soap compared to antibacterial soap is three times as likely to transmit bacterial infectious diseases to food. Washing hands with whole-based solution by washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that washing hands with whole-based soap reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But using soap and water is more effective than washing hands with alcohol-based substances in reducing H1N1 type A flu virus and diphysis chloride from hands. Measures needed to improve hand health in health centers may include training staff to wash hands, increasing access to alcohol-based washers and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is more effective in different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is taught as an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing products in homes, schools and workplaces challenges the achievement of practices needed to wash hands globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water leaks for hand washing near private or public toilets are rare, although there are cheaper options for building hand washing stations.
However, the low rate of hand washing, more not because of the lack of soap or water, but may be the result of our bad habits.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy choices, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioral changes at a community level.
Monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of this work.
A systematic review of 70 studies showed that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand washing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advertising campaigns are less effective.One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the three-star UNICEF "Rocket", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while meeting other health requirements.
By complying with minimum standards, schools could eventually be promoted from one star to three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of promotional measures for hand washing to reduce illness and death in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising programs aimed at changing people’s behavior. As a result of Pandemic Coronavirus 20-2019, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
A handful of studies, in general, have dismissed the cost-efficiency of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one review shows that promoting handwashing with soap compared to other measures is economically significantly more affordable.
For the first time, the importance of handwashing for human health—especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was highlighted in the mid-19th century by two of the pioneers of hand health: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the English Florence Nightingale who was “the pioneer of modern nursing.”
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant smell called miasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of food-related diseases and healthcare-related infections caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to more widely promote hand health as an important way to prevent infectious outbreaks.
The 2009 swine flu epidemic and the 2020 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect yourself from infectious diseases.
For example, skirts titled “Right Handwashing Wheels” were installed next to hand washes in public toilets and toilets in German administrative buildings and airports.
The term “washing someone’s hands from something” means declaring a person’s reluctance to accept responsibility for a subject or participate in it.
The term is taken from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate abandoned the decision to crucify Christ, but the term is now used in some English communities with much wider application.
In McBeth Shakespeare, Mrs. McBeth forcibly washes her hands in an attempt to clear a spotty stain, demonstrating her guilty conscience for the crimes she had committed and encouraging her wife to commit them.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more than others after being reminded or reminded of unethical actions and tend to use washing equipment.
Additionally, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a deepening are less likely to participate in other mandatory “dumping” measures, such as volunteering.
Doctrines recommend handwashing for health and symbolic purposes. Handwashing symbols and the use of water and none soap for handwashing are part of the handwashing religion that has been shown in many doctrines including Buddhism, Hinduism, Prayer and Memorial Results in Judaism, Basin in Christianity and Prayer in Islam. Doctrines also recommend health handwashing after specific tasks.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam command to wash hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sexism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls the risks associated with COVID-19 at work.
Covid-19-related risk control at work implies the use of safe-health practices to control risks to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Adequate control of workplace risks depends on the workplace and type of work and should be based on an assessment of the sources of risk, the severity of disease in the community and the risk factors for workers who may be exposed to the vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk, have fewer work contacts with ordinary people and other colleagues and are recommended for basic measures to prevent infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking care of breathing habits andining daily cleaning and counter contamination of the workplace.
Average-risk jobs include jobs where employees need to have frequent contact or close contact with people who have not been infected or are not suspected of being infected, but may become infected due to continued spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the general public, for example in schools, in densely populated working environments and in some retail stores with high volume of people.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, includes air ventilation through high-resolution air filters, anti-vaporization, and having personal protective equipment in the face of a person with CVD-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes that healthcare workers who are exposed to people who are exposed to or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, including those who are known to be at high risk, are at a very high risk if employees perform work that leads to the production of particles in the air or collect, transport or treat samples from people who are affected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
A suitable way to control risks for these individuals will include engineering controls such as creating negative-pressure ventilation chambers and using personal protective equipment suitable for the job task.
Quidditch-19 can have a variety of effects on the working environment.
Employees may not be present at work due to illness, need to take care of others or fear of potential confrontation.
Business patterns can change, both in terms of what goods are needed and in terms of how they are obtained (such as shopping at lounge hours or purchases through home delivery services or car purchases).
Finally, the transportation of items from geographical areas severely affected by Kuwait-19 can be stopped. Necessary preparations and programs that can be used to respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine and address the level of risk associated with different workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure to illness, risk factors from home and community environments and individual risk factors for employees such as aging or chronic diseases.
It also describes the necessary control measures to address those risks, as well as potential plans to deal with situations that may result in infertility.
Necessary preparedness and plans to respond to infectious diseases may be based on national or local recommendations.
Response targets include reducing disease transmission between employees, protecting people who are most exposed to adverse health effects,ining business activities and minimizing adverse impacts on other institutions in their supply chain.
The severity of disease in the areas where commercial activities take place affects decisions made.
The Multiple Risk Control Chain includes a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health in order to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
In cases where it is not possible to eliminate the dangers of Covid-19, the most effective methods of control, engineering controls followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
The necessary engineering control method is to keep employees away from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be affordable in the most economical way possible.
Administrative control methods include changes in policies or working practices implemented by an employee or employer.
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can prevent exposure to the virus to some extent.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks that exist for employees, properly installed (e.g., respiratory apparatus), continuously and properly covered, regularly inspected,ined and replaced if necessary, properly removed, cleaned and properlyined or removed to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk have fewer work contacts with ordinary people and their other colleagues.
Basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all work environments include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking care of breathing habits including covering their mouths and noses when swallowing, preparing paper towels and garbage bags, preparing for remote work or in varied shelves if necessary, encouraging workers to refrain from using other people’s tools and equipment, and cleaning and anti-infecting the workplace regularly.
Rapid identification and separation of potentially infected people is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends workers who have acute respiratory disease symptoms should stay at home for at least 24 hours without the use of a fever reducer or other symptom-changing medication, from fever, fever symptoms and other symptoms of illness, and that vacation policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for family members, and employees should also be aware of these policies.
According to the Office for Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs at average risk include jobs where employees need to have frequent contact or close contact less than six feet (1.8 meters) away with people who are not infected with or suspected of being infected with Kuwait-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to continued spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel in areas where Kuwait-19 is widely spread.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, for example in places such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some busy retailers. Engineering control methods for these and higher-risk groups may include installing high-power air filters, increasing heating rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic protectors for incidents and installing automatic service windows to customers. Administrative controls for these and higher-risk groups include: encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing sessions with virtual communications robots, creating varied skin bars, preventing unnecessary trips to places exposed to Shihuahua-19, preparing emergency communications programs including establishing associations to respond to worker concerns, training employees on the necessary risk factors that need to be protected or packed with personal 19 measures, training employees who are exposed to personal access, guaranteeing and exposing employees to other measures, including regular work resources, and routines that may be limited to the level of use of the workplace, which may include access to personal equipment, clothes and clothes.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use a breathing apparatus.
If a person on board an airplane becomes sick, appropriate measures to protect staff and other passengers may include separating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning only one crew to serve the patient and provide a face mask to the patient, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose when he is thirsty or thirsty.
The aircraft crew must use medical gloves for one-time use when caring for the sick passenger or when exposed to body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and should use more personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent dizziness or breathing problems.
Gloves and other unused items should be placed in biologically hazardous bags and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and anti-infected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delayed travel during illness, individual carcinoma and, in case of fever or other symptoms during travel, immediate notification to the medical center on board the ship.
For schools and child care centers, if the infected person has entered the school building in the community regardless of the spread of the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the site for a short period of time in order to clean up or counter infection.
If there is a low or moderate degree of disease transmission in the community, the following measures can be taken toward social segregation: cancellation of academic journeys, gatherings and other large communities such as physical training classes or coaching or spending food in a trio, increasing the distance between tables, removing people from entering and expelling, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
When the likelihood of disease transmission in the community exists at a significant level, in addition to social detachment methods, long-term school shutdowns should be considered.For law staff who carry out their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowers their immediate health risk.
Law enforcement officers who need to communicate with people affected or suspected of Kuwait-19 are advised to follow the instructions that emergency medical technicians follow, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact at the time of the arrest of persons, employees should remove their belts and supplies before re-use using a household cleaning spray or a clean and anti-freezing towel while following standard procedures for using and removing used personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes healthcare workers, including those at high risk.
High-risk jobs include employees in medical services, support, laboratory and medical transportation that have been exposed to people with or suspected HIV/AIDS.
Employees whose work leads to the production of particles stuck in the air, or collecting, transporting or treating samples of people affected or suspected of Kuwait-19 are at high risk.
Activities that lead to the production of particles stuck in the air include piping, screening, bronchoscopy and some dental operations and examinations or aggressive sampling of the patient.
High-risk jobs include employees who prepare bodies of people who were infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 at the time of death. The level of risk becomes very high in the event of a break-up. Additional engineering control methods for this group include creating separate rooms for patients who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, including when performing work that leads to the production of locked particles in the air.
Negative pressure heating may be suitable for some health and treatment centers.
Patient samples should be approached with level 3 biosynthesis precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if newly suspected patients entered Kuwait-19, they should be kept in a distinct and separate waiting room. In addition to using other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respiratory apparatus for those who work within a 6-foot range of patients affected or suspected of Kuwait-19, as well as for those who perform tasks that lead to the production of particulate matter in the air.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory filter device is approved by NIOSH and uses a comprehensive program of respiratory protection that includes appropriate tests, training and medical examinations according to specifications.
Other types of respiratory devices can have greater protection and make it more convenient for employees to use. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of body-wide coverage because covid-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of surgical masks for people in the entrance points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, garments and gloves for people who collect respiratory system samples of patients or care for or carry patients with COVID-19 and do not carry out any activity that leads to the production of particles stuck in the air.
In the case of work in which particles are produced locked in the air, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: conduct medical examinations in absentia, create physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allow entrance to the room only to those who are directly involved in caring for patients with COVID-19; use personal protective equipment only for specific tasks; use a respiratory mask when caring for multiple patients who are all affected by a disease; monitor and coordinate the supply chain of personal protective equipment; and avoid using a mask for people who have no symptoms of the disease.

This month we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.
All-inclusive disease is something that clearly highlights the universal unity of human beings and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on the sympathy, cooperation and socialization that is at the heart of the organization.
The accompaniment and level of care we’ve seen among our colleagues through email, calls and chats reflects the incredible people we’re lucky and proud to work with.
I am so grateful and grateful that I have all of you as a partner, by my side.
Last week, someone thanked us for what we did.
They reminded me how confident it is that the world can now visit Wikipedia and what a powerful sign that this important resource can be online and accessible to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites up to date or our partners receive money or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than ever, needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but how we work will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we do our joint work from the beginning of next week.
Changes to our work and plans.
As Robin recalled earlier, Team-C met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the days and months ahead.
During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was an appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this period.
We wanted to overcome stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce it, no problem.
Employees, contractors and contractors:
By secondary notice, we expect to work 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We’re not announcing holidays – if you can work more regular hours, you’re eating the pain of the mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and no matter if you are taking care of your loved ones, buying food, or visiting a doctor, your health is a priority for us.
We do not track your time.
If you are sick, don’t work.
It should go without saying it, but we are saying it.
There’s no need to take an exit leave or a personal leave – just tell your manager and help your team browse the calendars and schedules and make sure someone has the key tasks covered.
(If your Quevid-19 test results are diagnosed as positive, please inform Bryan of the T&C department so that T&C can help you and ensure that your condition is managed properly.)
The salary of employees working hours is paid in full.
As we said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and partners who work on hourly terms.
All salaries are paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress from the world around us.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
Again, it’s about your own care.
Please contact your manager so we know what to expect and can plan accordingly.
Some things are necessary.
There are things that we have to do them.
SRE teams, HR Ops, trust and security, and attracting capital (and others) do fundamental and important tasks that may need more support.
We will start a process with other departments to evaluate current goals and focus on supporting the things that are essential to our mission.
There is a lot to do for all of us, we will all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down now, we will not see any harm later.
We don’t have a plan to work twice as soon as pandemic is over and to get things done now.
You are not expected to work extra hours to fulfill deadlines that are now impossible.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed and will endeavour to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
What about the APP?
To align with the new realities and expectations of the daily working hours, we intend to adjust our 2021-2020 annual delivery schedule.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 programme that will give us more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize vital tasks, caring for themselves and caring for their loved ones, while allowing those who need or want to work fewer hours over the next few weeks to do so.
This time extension significantly reduces the level of pressure on current work schedules across the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and will inform the representatives and teams of the next steps as soon as it is approved.
Thanks to the annual planning team for leading this work.
Office condition, exposure to illness and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of SF’s colleagues may have been exposed to Covid-19.
However, for more care, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to counterfeit all levels in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to defuse all levels, as well as the lobby and elevator along the way to our floor.
This building has its own care protocol and uses products that are beneficial to the health of its inhabitants.
We are confident that when we decide to return, the office will be well-prepared.
Our Washington office is located on a WeWork and they have shared their Quidditch-19 protocol with us and all of our DC-based employees.
According to the San Francisco State Guidelines, our Washington DC office has turned into a completely remote set since last week.
As some of our New York-based partners know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Old colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be a match to circumstances and would like to have suggestions for you:
Limit the length of sessions to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, look at how they can be held in a few days.
Clearly specify the session, have an agenda and submit the necessary content for study in advance.
Configure video by default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Appoint someone responsible for the meeting, someone responsible for monitoring the chat to follow questions and list of speakers, and someone for noting (or joint noting).
If you need a convenient destination, send an email to the technical support team.
Use your health expenses for the promise.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk about shared work with your colleagues.
The Human Resources Operational Team to support increased work spread across the foundation is pursuing web-based ergonomic guidance.
Last week we asked all recipients of foundation-level grants such as editathon to cancel public events held with Wikimedia budget until the World Health Organization announced the end of pandemic.
We inform them that we know that our request to cancel programs and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out agreed activities related to receiving financial benefits and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying their purposes.
Next week we will provide more guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional social meetings.
There seems to be a common feeling across the global community, both discomfort due to these disturbances and at the same time feeling relieved due to their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikipedia, and so on.
As we move forward, CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space available to the community to monitor their impact and keep us connected with them.
Related topics about Kuwait-19
We will send you a meeting invitation for special employees to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC with 07:00 PT time.
We have since used and put new and more information at your disposal, answer your questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We are all together on this issue and we are here to help you in every way we can.
In the meantime, you can find relevant information through this email and other information related to Quidditch-19 in the Office Wiki.
CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to establish regular contacts with those of our employees who reside in countries that are already significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, main workflow or news coverage challenges, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you when needed.
If you want to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan – Director of International Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as giving up our work and commitments.
Rather, it indicates that at this moment our work and commitments probably need to be aligned with ways we haven’t in the past.
These are facilities that we believe are essential to support each other so that we can continue our work and support our movement and provide the services that the worlds are committed to them.
The things we have planned will be waiting for us when it comes.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for important work to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to this, so we want you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be in your best shape when the need grows.
Now, please wash your clothes and don’t put your hands on your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The b'enzyme metabolizer angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that absorbs to the external level (cellular cavity) of the lungs, cavities, heart, kidneys and intestines cells.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the angiotensin-related metabolite enzyme (ACE) by reducing and increasing angiotensin-II levels (Ang(1-7), which has made it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transforming enzymes are 2 types of methanol-containing enzymes located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal range of M2 peptidase and a range of C-terminal chloric amino acid carrier.
ACE2 is a type I monocytogenic protein whose enzymatic active range is located near the lungs and other tissue levels.
The external range of ACE2 cells, along with another enzyme called adhesive, is separated from the intestinal range and the dissolved protein is eventually eliminated from the urine after entering the bloodstream.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 flushes into the cell membrane of mainly reumatoid type II cells, small intestinal endocytes, endothelial cells, and slender muscle cells of more organs.
The signs of ACE2 mRNA are seen in the cortex of the brain, the cord, the hypothalamus, and the cortex of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE detoxifier.
ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn separates the fenylalanine carboxyl-terminal amino acid from angiotensinII (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes to angiotensin rugga (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Bradycaen, apeline, norotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the intracranial flow of the amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and plays a role in the development of Huntington’s disease.
ACE2, as an intruder protein, plays the role of the primary point of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (Sars-Agent Virus), and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-Agent Virus-19).
More importantly, the stacking of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 into the ACE2 enzymatic range at cellular level leads to intracelular infestation and transmission of viruses and enzymes into endosomes within cells.
This entry process is required for the preparation of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host protein, which is inhibited in the ongoing research process as a potential treatment under consideration. It has been assumed that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help to cope with infection.
However, numerous professional communities and regulatory bodies have suggested continuing treatment with standard ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A rule-of-law review published on July 11, 2012 found that “use of ACE inhibitors was linked to a dramatic 34 percent reduction in the likelihood of alopecia compared to controls.”
Meanwhile, “The likelihood of arthritis decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were more likely to develop arthritis, especially those who had a stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was linked to a reduction in the number of deaths due to alopecia, although the results were less likely to cause alopecia compared to the overall outcomes.”
Human recycled ACE (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute rheumatoid injury and appears to have improved respiratory hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory dysthesia syndrome caused by lipopoly sacharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a new drug for people with sensitivity to systemic and classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or diseases that stimulate the circulation of angiotensin II. The impact of rhACE2 injection has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
b'Quevid-19 programs are mobile software applications that are used to guide calls during the 20-2019 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (relationships) who are likely to have been in contact with an infected person.
Several programs have been developed or proposed that are supported by government officials in some territories and regions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the preparation of call guidance programs.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially in systems based on the geolocation of users of the application.
Less intrusive methods include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will store support for Bluetooth-based apps directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed a program that allows citizens to find out if they have been in contact with people with Kuwait-19.
The program has been deployed in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The program has been developed by the local IT community, has been released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has released a blockchain-based program called "StopKorona!" to guide potential contact with infected people and provide an immediate response to therapeutic referrals.
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On April 12, the government announced that the call guidance program is in an advanced stage of development and will be ready to stabilize within a few weeks.
Both Australia and Zelandia have plans based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geographical area program for patients with Kuwait-19 and residents of Moscow, to prevent them from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has pointed out a number of application problems associated with program-depleted systems, including potential false positive and inefficient results if the program is used in small population samples.
By investigating issues related to the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that are allowed to add coronavirus apps to the App Store and only allows “official” or authorized organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the consequences of co-monitoring using coronavirus programs, stating in particular that it is unclear whether or not the surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight criteria for government plans:
Supervision must be “legal, necessary and appropriate”;
Monitoring and monitoring must have automatic cancellation capabilities;
The use of the data should be limited to cases relating to Kuwait-19;
The security of data and information must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence.
Digital monitoring should not be discriminatory and isolated.
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the legal framework;
Guarantees should be considered to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain of abuse;
Targeted involvement of all “related stakeholders” including public health experts and groups in the region is essential.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published the lists.
The Google/Apple proposal is aimed at addressing the problem of continuous monitoring by removing interference from their device operating systems, as soon as necessary.
In some countries, the network localization process has been used instead of the program, and as a result, the need to download the program and the ability to escape the scam has been lost.
In Israel, the rule of law has been adopted.
Network-based platforms that have access to local raw data may violate privacy.
However, not all central server systems require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-keepers only use central servers for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed system was used to control calls.
Instead of using a specialized program, the system collected navigation information from various sources, including mobile device navigation data and card transaction data, and used it to notify people who could be infected.
In addition to using this information to communicate to potential audiences, the government makes local information publicly available.This type of disclosure is allowed as a result of widespread changes in data protection laws, as a result of the MERS spread in the country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of applications and websites.Some countries, such as Germany, have considered the use of centralized systems and privacy guards.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been revealed.
Lead contact with privacy is an accepted concept whose history of documentary research relates to it dates back to at least 2013.Until April 7, 2020, dozens of undergraduate groups were working on privacy practices, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record how close a user was to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that adopts centralized and non-centralized approaches and is not an autonomous protocol. Of non-centralized protocols, it can be referred to “near-centralized near-conflict with privacy protection” (DP-PPT/DP-3T), “temporary contact numbers” (TCN, known as call event numbers, CEN), “privacy-sensitive protocols” and “plane call guidance partnerships” (PACT).
In these protocols, personal data will never be removed from the device and all corresponding events will take place inside the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Testing Center has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy practices in the process of collecting and using location and targeting data, to guide the process of QVID-19.
The platform was developed on the basis of the research findings contained in the official report “Applications Legacy: Maintaining Personal Privacy During Everything” published in March 2020.Another similar initiative, the SafeTrace platform is the product of Enigma MPC. The company is dedicated to developing privacy technologies that have formed at the MIT Media Laboratory.
SafeTrace with secure hardware technologies allows users to place sensitive local and health data, without violating data privacy, at the disposal of other users and regulators.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed through a number of groups. These groups gathered together on what was essentially covered by similar and largely coupled protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and providing a global cooperation framework in the field of guidance and warning programmes, from the key aspects of achieving widespread acceptance.
On 9 October 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has made the BlueTrace protocol available to the public as part of its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the controllers of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a call-driven initiative that they claimed would preserve privacy.The initiative is based on a combination of “low-energy Bluetooth” technology and privacy-keeping encryption.
They also published the main features of the technology used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three stages:
Introducing tools to empower governments to create coronavirus control programs with privacy capabilities
Direct integration of this feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to solve the acceptance and continuous monitoring problems by distributing the software through an operating system update and then removing it in the same way after the threat is removed.
A drug adjustment (known as change of application, change of prescription, change of function or change of therapy) is a change in the use of a drug approved to treat a disease or physical problem different from what the drug was originally developed for.
It is a path of scientific research that is being conducted to develop safe and effective treatments for QVID-19.
Other research objectives may include the development of the Covid-19 vaccine and improved human plasma transfer. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has several ligand connectors.
The analysis of these connector sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral drug against the Quevid-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be referred to the polypepine protease, RNA-affiliated RNA polymers, heliase, S-protein, and ADP ribosphatease.
Hussein A. A. and colleagues reviewed several proposed drugs that were then optimized for skeletal similarity to the most approved drugs to accelerate the process of developing a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in the pre-clinical study to be proposed in the design of the clinical study.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or people who are planning to get pregnant.
The lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) review, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, found that “no benefits have been observed.”
These drugs are designed to prevent the spread of HIV by sticking to the proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that can tissue the SARS-CoV-2 protein.In the scientific community, reports have been made about guiding resources towards changing the use of drugs that were specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has unified lopinavir/ritonavir in international tests.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola viral disease and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later identified that Remdesivir was active in a laboratory environment against Philo, Pneumovirus, Paramyx and Corona viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through movement that can lead to more severe and congestive diseases.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that Remdesivir may be genetic-effective inhibitors of resistance formation. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two cases that are the neighboring Cleveland Educational Hospital. One includes people with mild illness and another people with severe illness.
Three clinical trials have been conducted on the effects of intravenous vitamin C injection on people with severe severe disease, two of which are controlled with darunoma (China and Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).

Among the antibiotics presented as a potential alternative to curvade-19 treatments, the following can be mentioned:
Toquilisumab (Anti-IL-6 Component): Approved in China
Also test laboratories in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaccin Covid-19 is the 2019 coronavirus vaccine (Covid-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, numerous efforts are underway to build the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it does not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the active virus, to be available before the next 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines in April were under Phase I safety studies.
Kuwait-19 was identified in December 2019.
The widespread global outbreak occurred in 2020 and led to dramatic investment and research activities to build vaccines.
Many organizations use the released genome to produce a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that CEPI’s requirements for vaccine development include speed, production capacity, scale stability and universal access.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms are under investigation and development by early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against KEV-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have entered Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I amplifier and proposed vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase I expander and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus carrier)
According to CEPI scientists’ announcement in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them have been approved as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute’s announcement) and 37 others have been made public but some of them are not publicly available (probably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II trials involve preliminary safety and safety examinations, usually randomized and controlled with a dermatologist, carried out in different centers to determine more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants in a control group and optimize the efficacy of vaccines for disease prevention to detect unwanted dosage effects.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in the active development phase (started by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (currently in the pre-clinical research phase).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was researching the ability of molecular vaccines to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate immune responses.

In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a proposed vaccine based on DNA, possibly ultrasound.
Using bacterial agents, this DNA will be designed to multiply within human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles.This process stimulates the immune system to produce immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined their resources to access IBM supercomputers as well as cloud browsing resources from Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have improved or undesirable effects.
That means they may have benefits beyond preventing disease.
Another randomized laboratory in Australia is scheduled to register 4,170 medical service sector workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective at the manufacturing stage.
Early research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using Covid-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 tragic rats, other laboratory animals and non-human specimens, suggests the need for Level 3 immunity prevention measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard immunity routines.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal samples.
By 2020, there will be no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.

During Morse's pregnancy, it was thought that ongoing research on Morse would possibly provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
Until March 2020, there was one marsh vaccine (DNA-based) that had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and there were three other vaccines that were all virus carriers. There were also two adenovirus carriers (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA carriers (MVA-MERS-S).
The views posted on social media have promoted conspiracy theories about the existence of the virus and the vaccine for it.
Inventions mentioned on various social media sites refer to previous inventions related to genetic twists and vaccines related to other coronavirus types such as SARS.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a type of infectious disease known as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms are fever, dizziness and shortness of breath.
Other signs may include fatigue, muscle pain, coughing, coughing, hearing loss and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some cases lead to viral ulcers and multidisciplinary defects.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were worldwide from 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 of them leading to death.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is mainly transmitted through close contact, often through droplets caused by coughing, coughing, or talking.
Although the droplessness causes these drops to spread, the droplessness usually falls on the ground or on the surface instead of moving over long distances.
People can get affected by touching the infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The probability of infection is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. Of course, there is also the possibility of transmission of the virus before the onset of symptoms and in the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the RRT-PCR (rRT-PCR) of the neuropharynx swab.
The use of the mask is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and their surroundings.
Recommendations for the use of the mask for the general public are different; some officials are opposed to the use of the mask and some agree with it, and some consider wearing the mask mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for Quevid-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in every six areas covered by the WHO.
People with this virus may be without symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency signs may indicate difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking and dizziness in the face or lips.
Symptoms related to the upper respiratory tract, such as rashes, rashes in the nose or throat, have also been seen with less rashes.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, strabismus and cough are observed at varying degrees.
Some cases in China were initially caused only by shortness of breath and severe heart attack.
In others, the disease can continue until the initial stage of laryngitis, multidisciplinary deficiency and even death.
This period is called a period of depression.
The curvature period is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms become apparent within 11.5 days of the moment of infection. reports show that not all infected people necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in the transmission process is still unclear. Of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals may be the cause of the disease.
The proportion of people without symptoms is unclear at the moment and is under investigation.The KCDC has that 20% of all confirmed cases remained unclear during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China (NHC) has started listing unsimptomatic cases in its statistics since April 1st, with 130 (78%) of the 166 cases of infection on that day unsimptomatic at the time of the test.
Both mixed and mixed can be virus carriers.
Speaking loudly disperses more particles than speaking slowly.
Researchers in Singapore have shown that not covering your mouth and nose during swallowing can cause droplets to be released up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually aerobic, the National Academy of Sciences has announced that there is a possibility of transmission through the air, and in air collectors installed in the corridor outside people’s rooms, positive samples related to the virus’s RNA have been seen.
Some medical routines such as tubing and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory outbreaks and spread of the virus through the air.
Although there are concerns about the transmission of the virus through the liver, this probability is little assumed. The probability of transmission of the virus through humans is more symptomatic. The probability of transmission of the virus is lower before the symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has announced that despite the inidentification of the pathogen, each person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus can survive for a day on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and for up to four hours on 99% of plastics.
Of course, this time depends on humidity and temperature.
The proper use of soap and detergent is also effective. soap products destroy the protective layer of viral fat, deactivate it and remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzeconium chloride and clorhexidine gluconate, have less effect.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, sclerosis samples were taken on average two days after the onset of the sclerosis.
In five patients out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load and in the sixth patient, the highest viral load was seen in the second-day trial.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was initially taken from three people with alopecia and associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in coronaviruses of related nature.
The virus is destroyed outside the human body with home soap. The soap protects the bubble. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
Quevid-19 has the most effect on the lungs because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II pulmonary cluster cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called “spay” (pollomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of people infected and hospitalized at Wuhan Hospital. This problem is more common in severe cases of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to symptomatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders in the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and play a role in heart activity.
The higher incidence of thyroidism (31%) and viral thyroidism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with Covid-19 infection and may be associated with weak diagnosis. Covid-19 deaths have resulted in diffuse arterial injury (DAD) and the influence of lymphocytes-containing inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has shifted to stem cells containing ACE2 in the respiratory tract, signs of severe systemic inflammation have been observed in patients with covid-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells with the absorption of inflammatory IL-6 secretion monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology has been demonstrated in Covid-19 patients.
Influence of lymphocytes has also been in the course of collapse.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is the momentum retarded polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with the nasopharyngeal fluid. Of course, a nasopharyngeal fluid or mixed sample is also applicable.
Results are usually ready within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be used, but it requires taking two blood samples at a time interval of two weeks.
Chinese scientists were able to differentiate a species of coronavirus and release its genetic fabric, thus enabling laboratories around the world to perform independent polymer chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infections.
By April 4, 2020, Padden tests (which have the ability to diagnose active infections and an individual’s history of infection) had been in the hands of the study, but not much has yet been done.
The accuracy of this Chinese experiment in the field of testing is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care trial on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The Zhongnan Hospital Diagnostic Guidelines from the University of Wuhan have suggested methods for diagnosing infections based on clinical characteristics and risk of all diseases.
Multi-tubular matte glass curtains with side, non-comparative and rear distribution are used to detect in the early stages of infection.
Sub-western overwhelming, stable covering (enrichment of the spleen with variable clotting) and severe stiffness may be a sign of disease progression.
There is not much information available about the microscopic and pathophysiological lesions of Quevid-19.
The most important pathological findings in calcium discharge include:
Macroscopy: Precaria, Precaria, Hardness of the Heart and Respiratory Man
There are four levels of severity of viral allergy:
Mild hypertension: respiratory hypertension, pneumocyte hypertension, large pneumocyte hypertension, inflammation of the intestines with lymphocyte infiltration and multislim large cell formation.
Injury: Injury to the injury to the injury to the injury.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Improving alopecia: formation of spotting in respiratory cavities and respiratory fibromialgia.
Blood: Intracranial dispersive clotting (DIC); lococorytroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, refraining from being in busy places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory health and refraining from touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when swallowing and using the inner part of the towel, if the towel is not available.
Hand health after swallowing or acid smell is recommended.
The CDC has suggested the use of cloth masks in public places to a certain extent, to prevent the spread of disease by people without signs. Social distancing measures aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups of people through closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and canceling large gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include observing a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) between people.
Since the discovery of the vaccine is not expected at least until 2021, an important part of the management process of the vaccine is the attempt to reduce all infestation, or the same “deformation level.”
The CDC also recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap water for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or clearly contaminated hands, before eating and after nasal ejaculation, nausea or appetite.
The CDC also recommends the use of a hand alcohol detergent with a minimum alcohol content of 60%, in the absence of water and soap.For areas where conventional hand detergents are not available, the WHO has offered two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
It is used to remove micro-alcoholic havoc from hydrogen peroxide; "This active substance is not used for hand detoxification."
Glycerin is used as a moisture preservative.
Individuals are administered with supportive care that may include fluid-treatment, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs injured.
The CDC suggests that people who are suspicious of anxiety use a simple mask.
Bronchial respiratory oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Adherence to individual health and lifestyle changes and family diet are suggested to enhance safety.
Supportive treatments may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the China National Health Commission have proposed care for people who are infected with Kuwait-19.
Special care professionals and lung specialists in the U.S. have compiled various institutional treatments proposals in a free source format called IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Covid-19.
To alleviate symptoms, some medical experts have diagnosed the use of paracetamol (Staminofen) for first-line intake better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the likelihood of transmission of the virus, it is necessary to take precautions, especially in therapeutic sites where blocked particle-generating routines, such as piping or manual aeration, are carried out.
For therapists who care for people with HIV/AIDS, the CDC recommends personal maintenance in the “Airborne Carcinogenic Infection Convention” (AIIR) and the use of standard precautions, contact prevention measures and airborne precautions. CDC has issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during this pandemic.
Proposed tools include: PPE gloves, respiratory or facial masks, eye protectors and surgical gloves. If any, use of respiratory masks (rather than facial masks) is preferred.
The N95 breathing mask has been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of the mask with an “emergency license” (EUA).
This mask is designed to protect against airborne particles such as clay but is not guaranteed against specific biological factors for use outside the main application.
If the mask is not available, the CDC suggests using a face protector or, as a last resort, a handmade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that it requires mechanical induction or alternative methods, but some require such measures.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory dysfunction caused by Quevid-19 is examined in the case of people who have a dysfunction in their hands. Some evidence suggests that with a flux-out of sight or positive double-layer pressure in the respiratory tract can be prevented piping.
Whether either of these methods leads to achieving similar benefits in patients is still unclear.
Some doctors prefer to use aggressive mechanical scanning if any, because this method limits the rate of scattering of residual particles compared to the upstream nasal tract. The incidence of severe cases is more common in elderly people (people over 60, and especially those over 80).
In many developed countries, hospital beds are not sufficient, as a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in cases of severe infection to Kuwait-19 that require accommodation is limited.
In a study conducted in China, it was found that 5% of people in the special care sector are in need of special care, 2.3% need mechanical care, and 1.4% die.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized due to Kuwait-19 infection are eventually treated in ICU.
Mechanical dysfunction becomes more complicated as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) becomes aggravated in Queda-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
To maximize oxygen absorption and cutting from the probability of radiological injury associated with the thoracic and thoracic apparatus, the use of a thoracic apparatus with high pressure control and PPEP conditions is essential.
Old booster devices may not be PEEP high.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Apparently Remdesivir is the most promising among the drugs.
While the development of new drugs will take time until 2021, several of the drugs under testing have already been approved for other applications or are in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO has suggested that volunteers participate in trials related to evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential drugs.The FDA has granted a temporary license for the use of plasma purification as a trial treatment; of course, in cases where a person's life is severely or completely at risk.
This medicine has not provided the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The app can identify the 'most negative calls' with the help of surveillance data and identify the probability of an incident.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the app will report the matter to the local health authorities in addition to providing a home carcinogen proposal. Cellular cellular screening analysis, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected people and their associates in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible for security agencies to secure cellular data from suspects of Kuwait-19.
The measure was taken to protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom placed collected phone location data at the Robert Koch Institute, a federal government agency in Germany, to enable research into the trend of the virus and its prevention.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify people with cancer disorders.
Giulio Gallera, an Italian regional health officer, told mobile operators that “40% of people still move freely.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend with the company of over 42,000 people.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, called for creative initiatives to prevent the coronavirus outbreak.
Cardiovascular disease, travel restriction, side effects of treatment or fear of infection can stress people.
Rory O’Connor said: “The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental stress and economic problems can change people’s mental and physical health.”
It can be symptomatic or asymptomatic at some stages, with complications like other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as colds.
Mild cases usually improve within two weeks, but recovery in people with severe or acute illnesses can take three to six weeks.
Based on data relating to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the highest risk groups for infection with COVID-19; of course, there is not much information available about COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause alopecia.
In unhealthy people, Quevid-19 can rapidly turn into acute respiratory dystrophic syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory dysfunction, infectious shock, or multidisciplinary defect.
Covid-19’s consequences include infections, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, cavity, and liver failure.
Blood retention disorders, especially an increase in protrombin time, have been observed in 6% of people who were hospitalized due to Quevid-19. Kidney failure was 4% among those people.
Approximately 20-30% of people with Quevid-19 have seen signs of increased liver enzyme secretion (transaminase).
According to the report, the average time gap between signs and death was ten days, five days of which is associated with the disease.
Of course, in patients transferred to ICU, an average time gap between infarction and death was for seven days.
Recent case studies showed that the average time gap between early signs and death was 14 days, with the full range of six to 41 days.
Studies by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-asymmetrical tests of lung samples of dead people indicate diffuse fibromial damage and cellular fibromyoxide emissions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to the lung image with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8 percent of deaths by China’s National Health Commission, increased levels of troponin or heart attack were caused by heart damage.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of residents have previously suffered from the disease.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region also affect the death rate.
Estimated death rates from the disease vary due to regional differences as well as difficulties with the method of recognition.
A low number of mild cases may lead to overestimating the rate of casualties.
Of course, the fact that deaths were the result of previous incidents may mean that the current mortality rate has decreased.
Smokers, compared to non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration report noted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease and the presence of signs of organ damage in lung scans.
This condition can lead to special post-care post-healing syndrome.
By March 2020, it was unclear whether the history of the disease would cause effective, long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunization is likely based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, coronavirus test results have also been positive in people recovered from Covid-19.
There is a belief that these cases are caused by an infection and not a recurrence to infection.
It is assumed that this virus is natural and has an animal origin, through infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the outbreak of the infection was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
With a review of 41 confirmed first cases of Kuwait-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, the first case returns from its signs to December 1, 2019.
The official publications of the WHO have announced the date of the first cases of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
To measure death and death rates, different criteria are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of trials, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent from the initial stage and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed death from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for death from Covid-19 with clinical diagnosis or all receptions without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, by April 17, 2020, the global death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number varies in each region. From other measurements, the case mortality rate (CFR) can be referred to, which specifies the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease. Infectious mortality rate (IFR) is another criterion that specifies the percentage of infected (identified and unidentified) people who die from the disease.
This statistic is not limited to time and follows a specific population from the infection stage to the closure of the case.
Although not all infected people necessarily produce pandemics, the presence of pandemics may provide information about how many people are infected.
In the small village of 4,600 people in Castiglione d'Adda, Italy, 80 tonnes (1.7%) died from the virus.
In Gangelt, the disease spread as a result of Carnival festivals. Infection of young people resulted in relatively lower mortality and mortality rates. However, some deaths from Kuwait-19 have not been officially included in the category of deaths due to the virus.
Meanwhile, the German health system hasined its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, according to blood donor assessments, may have produced pedicles.
69 (0.004% of the population) confirmed deaths from Kuwait-19 were recorded.
The impact of this pandemic and its death rate vary between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, mortality and mortality rates in men have been to be higher.
The highest likelihood of developing is in men over the age of 50. This gap between women and men disappears by the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for this gender difference are unclear, but genetic and behavioral factors may be influential.
Gender-based cognitive safety differences, less smoking inclination among women, and more men’s exposure to similar diseases such as hemorrhage, may play a role in increasing men’s death rates at a younger age than women.
In Europe, 57% of infected men and 72% of those who died from Covid-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government has not taken any action to secure gender-related data in the context of COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are months and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that “Covid-19” was chosen as the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, announced that the CO is coronavirus-related, VI-related, D-abbreviated disease and 19-related to the time of its first detection: 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to prevent references to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or groups of people, based on international proposals for designation and with the aim of preventing female labeling. The virus is known as the causative agent of Covid-19, coronavirus 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the titles “Covid-19” and “Covid-19 agent virus” in official communications.
This disease and the virus that causes it are commonly called coronavirus.
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “coronavirus Wuhan”.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as the temporary names of the disease. These names were selected in accordance with the 2015 Guidelines on the Absence of Treasuring Place Names for Naming Viruses and Diseases.
The official names of Kuwait-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are increasing the production of health products such as nasal soaps and device parts.
For example, in one instance, an Italian hospital needed a suppurator and the supplier could not supply it on time, which resulted in a local start-up requiring the engineering of the suppurator and the production of 100 suppurations per night.
Following the early stages of Covid-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and insufficient information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease formed and quickly spread online.
This virus is transmitted from humans to animals.
Studies to find evidence of the virus’s proliferation in pigs, eagles, and chickens have failed.
No medication or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines is ongoing among government agencies, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization conducted a unified trial to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine yet, but various institutions are actively looking into proposed vaccines.
The results of previous surveys on SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are under investigation.
First, researchers are building a complete virus vaccine.
The use of a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at preventing the development of an immune response in the human body to a new infection.
The second step, subunit vaccines, is followed, with the aim of creating a vaccine that can sensitize the immune system to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on the Spike S protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third approach relates to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA, a new method of vaccine preparation).
Test vaccines for each of these initiatives should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of vaccines with the presence of four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Pattern-based development has been presented as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but there is some debate in this regard.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been underway.
Seven clinical trials evaluated treatments previously approved for the treatment of malaria, which could be referenced to four hydroxy chlorokin or chlorokin research schemes.
Changing applications of antiviral drugs are the subject of most of the Chinese research, which is expected to announce the results of nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the Covid-19 vaccine and the proposed drugs is ongoing.Many of the antiviral drugs available for the treatment of Covid-19 are under investigation, including remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta combination.
Until March 2020, there was endless evidence of remdesivir’s effectiveness.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unauthorized remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was examined in China in February 2020 and its preliminary results were released.
Of course, the researchers community is invited to fund these findings.
Korean and Chinese health institutions have suggested the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while suggesting a daily intake of one gram, has stated that taking the dose is twice as dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license for hydroxychloroquin and chlorochloroquin, with the help of physicians treating people with covid-19.In China’s 7 Virus Guidelines, the name interferon, ribavirin or oymyfenovir is outlined for the treatment of covid-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin intake is essential to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory environment.
Nitroxanthin, after its low-density effect on inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 proliferation has been proven, has been proposed for research in the human body.Studies have shown that preparation of primary spike protein with transgender protein serum 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entering SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with an ACE2 receptor.
The study of chlorokin and hydroxy chlorokin with/without oxitromycin has major limitations that have opened the medical community from acceptance without examination of these treatments. Oseltamivir does not inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment and its role in the treatment of Covid-19 has not been proven.
Cytokine storm can be a severe result of the subsequent phase of Quevid-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquin has anti-storm cytokine properties.China’s “National Health Commission” has approved tokylizomab after a brief review of the treatment guidelines.
After the use of the drug in people with severe illnesses produced positive results, it was undergoing a Phase 2 non-reversible trial at the national level in Italy.
By combining a serum freatin blood test to identify the cytoquin storm, it is working to counter this development that has been declared the cause of death for some people affected.
The FDA approved the Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist in 2017 based on past case studies for the treatment of cytokine-release-resistant syndrome that is generated by another cause, CAR T therapy cells.
To date, there has been no randomized and controlled evidence based on the effectiveness of tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS.
The transfer of pure and purified pathogens produced in the immune system of people who have improved from Kuwait-19 to people in need is under investigation as a non-vaccinating method with inactive immunization.
This method was tested for Saras and the results were not certain.
Viral anesthesia is a possible contributor to the operation on the basis of which inactivated pandemic therapy provides a defense ground against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other compounds, such as cytotoxic cells dependent on padden and/or fagocytosis, may be effective.
Other types of inactive therapeutic pesticides, such as the use of artificial monoclonal pesticides, are under investigation.
Cerebral serum production, which includes the fluid part of the blood taken from recovered people and contains specific pathogens of the virus, may increase for faster development.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, one of the doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital, later died as a result of the infection with Kuwait-19 and after public information about the outbreak of the virus.
