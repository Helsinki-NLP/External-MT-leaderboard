Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix it.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
I like to dance.
It's all going to be okay.

Why are you learning French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane. He's not going to be able to get her back.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
- Good morning, please.
Do you like the juice?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you get any sleep?
Tom is a crazy kid.
That's the way it is.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're getting for the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Could you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should talk about them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write it down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom is not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
Raw fish is not my taste.
- Sit down. - What?
You got anyone?
This is a student of Yutshu High School.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with this.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he all right?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me ?
May I know where you work?
Can someone explain it to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We've green-lighted the house.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom is here.
How are things in Boston?
I just got promoted.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play around here.
Please, shut the door.
Garlic is good for your health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
She's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop it.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What glitters is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
It's ringing my phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where 's the oven ?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who are these?

The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom wouldn't touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone been here ?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
Those aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today place more importance on popular culture than ever before.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you get your hair done?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.

You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who this is?
Did you see the baseball game on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
He does the same to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust the strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'll be right there.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me explain my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You 're 18 .
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
I'm going to say.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek mythology?
He closed the 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a dictionary of French.
The captain welcomed us.
She went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to get her down with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not being read.
Tom hugged Mary.
You wouldn't go to Australia and build a store?
What do you call that?

My office is in the city center.
She has two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom was interviewing Mary.

The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay, you know.
You're a man of great reliability.
Tom is not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys are not mine.
That was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I'll say it again and again.

I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm a little tired myself.
You sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize to me.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
His father is Japanese?
Careful, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?

We're going to kill you.
You're old enough to do it alone.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog".
You work hard.

It's actually a nice theory. The only downside I think it has is probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He's spending a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm really pissed off right now.

There's a lot of noise here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than this one.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.

Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk! You are drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
Are you awake?

Who is Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call me back.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk more slowly.
Put the book on top of the rest.
The bird's in the sky.

Are you drunk ?
He tried to write a story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going? !
My father's gone.

I've lost my pen.
How do you pronounce that word?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?

I'm too strict about this.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
How much are these apples?

I think they go to Australia just to have fun.
Tom's cheeks are red.
I'm the Richard.
What did you open it with?
Would she want a reservation, a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthday yesterday.
Tom has a Canadian passport.

Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We've been well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me to sleep, don't you?
Is it raining ?
He's very slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
