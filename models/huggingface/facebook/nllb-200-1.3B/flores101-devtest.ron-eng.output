Even though an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that there are adequate drugs to treat an existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies have indicated that it had less of a benefit in preventing death than was desired.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning that scientists used it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a hypothesis already widely held, but it provides details that cannot generally be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown at the top, with a light orange color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed ax, called a rahis, but do exhibit other characteristic elements of feathers  beards and barbels  the researchers concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression, and the researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken poop.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the pubic hair of a young.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.
The governor's office said that 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant as responsible for the bombing.
They discovered that the sun works by the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observations of the Arrow galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Arrow Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a sort of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll has discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate".
It's possible that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll argues, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she is in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole TB population appears to be still low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

 All the entrances to the caves, which have been called The Seven Sisters, are between 100 and 250 meters (328 - 820 feet) in diameter.
The infrared images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the probability that these are caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a less technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, polling stations have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the process, and at night, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in front of the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tampered with because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing the photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has told reporters that it will not make any further comment at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to draw on the basis of the pre-war borders of the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel claims that after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence for only five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, the test being monitored and its effectiveness subject to evaluation.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Hunting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the sport hunting programme of the Sport Hunting Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt were given comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organise elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MECI) stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company said were not serious.
The minister responded, saying that the delay on Apple's part is "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Bureau stated that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, the photos took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestling brothers also brought a tribute to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said that the moon was the first queen of the extremes, my first manager, the moon died in the night two months ago, a unique moment, as she was, a strong woman.
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed "Gold Powder", commented that "The Moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as three relay events, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the pain medication that was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before early February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comet may have been the source of the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on the use of satellites, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley and parking and public transport parking facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between the endemic Darwin's cyntheza, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus cynthezoa, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with your clean, wet hands, make a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and cause a crust of some kind to form.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of the sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, shared by men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-high rocket to take a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is to give us a much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the many smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each cat has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Families are made up of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and shoot with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can rage.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather a phrase of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they'll catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground to find them.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move around undetected, and they hunt by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., expel) from the lungs.
Plants produce food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 blade-shaped teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which means that nothing in its path escaped with good luck.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, and his food included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurians, and he may even have been a cannibal.
They also attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't stand up to them.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a perch.
Another difference is that while poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to make benches where they would lie down on their side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not have included foods that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of temples, pyramid-shaped towers called girders were built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; the shops were just stalls that faced the street; the houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not very forested, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he found, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words: The original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776. The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was kept rolled up.
Therefore, the marking was probably made simply for labelling.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was run by the French from Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces along with the Free French had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
Cities are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations per se.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  the Congress being its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to overturn interstate laws and tax tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, are ranked second in the world's most successful teams and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is home to nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an archipelago.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera's image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format, which is somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, so abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to it.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had caused many to question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were crusades between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to have a share of success.
So did the military, because instead of a class-based military hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the mundane, and he often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it's there, and once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things you can see are the clear, beautiful skies above and the mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, vaults, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The upward-hanging mark looks like a V, and the downward-hanging mark looks like a square or a square missing its bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the side where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow upward usually produces a softer sound, while a bow downward is stronger and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bow features are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen's eyes.
The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expense and interest associated with bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events unfolded is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is governed by an associated logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effectson society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you might say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silks and spices more precious than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow channels of communication, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years old.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe was starting to develop its own style, and one of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people started using buttons to lock their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated from society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child has been due to the rejection of the child by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or run away from home.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that has cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or site method is not a learning method but rather a support tool for people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scale, but so is the little stickman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is included in the software, providing the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in family care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extorting.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We see the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system needs to provide safe housing, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of children, which were not covered in the home they had previously lived in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinctive features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approaching types of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement and  continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated public reactions to websites.
Using video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to observe whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds at each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a way similar to the way chimps in the savannah today do.
Sleep interruption is the procedure whereby you intentionally wake up during normal sleep to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without waking up completely.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
Anyone can reach enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but with the addition of the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries distancing themselves.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was going to take 40 years and be fought in earnest by the armies of the delegates on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were rendered useless almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were put in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one part of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking over Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them near the house for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually in the care of goats that were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds.
Wagonways have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a common practice, but iron led to the faster use of wooden wheels on wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning straight man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and we should disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are now greater because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the document was given its first public reading by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But you can still see many of the dinosaur-like features in birds.
They have legs with claws and claws, lay eggs and walk on their backs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and the names of these numbers are binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by particular entomologists for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to fleas, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's best interests.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method, which is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers made extensive use of classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They have two experiments marking either the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of fieldwork include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visits to parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example would be visiting, taking pictures, and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural settlements to their jobs, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
They're all involved in society and they use transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Traffic flow studies are unfortunately difficult, because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to remain within reasonable constants; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying, and their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being six miles wide at points.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it accumulates water from thousands of smaller bodies of water.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about some of the most fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are fairly easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forth a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air, and fire.
He was referring to the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after it was created.
Sadly, as newer writing tools have come along, the pencil has lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, but splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km at the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in higher elevations.
It might be more maria in the nearby area, because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on identifying what attracts people's attention or what they enjoy.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment can determine whether or not they do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people become unrecognizable individuals who believe they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can freely manifest.
Therefore, the process by which an organisation works unitedly to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher performance.
The data from neurobiology is the physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such, it allows for narrowing the research area and defining it more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that have not been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulations that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computing, dealing with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in a few software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would be happy to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and the previous versions are maintained online, to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since the student audience is often the most critical, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study well beyond the ordinary school day.
The proper use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka County and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian excellence.
Larger portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that have the gift of surprising many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa lie in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and truly self-sustaining continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but don't make it look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, hand-grabbed, etc.
Be firm when you say no to a man, and don't be afraid to stay firm in your position (cultural differences or not, it's still not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, being named Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the White House, but abandoned it again in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tajine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of small things, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city an informational effort is required to understand the state of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trail rides in Africa.
The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
He was one of the main hosts during the Henry Louis Gates PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bounded by the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong is given by Hong Kong Island and is the place that many tourists look to as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a diagram of bright bars that is put in value by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urbanised part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists and they took over, and therefore for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, though - they also comprise some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two bands of 3.50 meters wide.
The free passage height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has struggled to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches are also held here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo games, see Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Lira (FKP), the value of which is set at the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably accept British and American currency; contact the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you have to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures often reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly wet or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, buffalo, elk, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be advisable to avoid smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the State of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a memorable naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide array of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would be better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you're apprehensive, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of flat white is unusual. A short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes full of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered in price, but very good.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April 1770 in the north.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp on-site and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're gonna have to get there early to catch a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music into the late night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, consider the location of the cabin, since navigating through the ice makes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers and the money spent by them.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood up and guests staying in the venue.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness affects judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Drivers driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or viscous or condensation, or by ice forming on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably Africa's main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to the overland voyages undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those of the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll be able to see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, or walking down) consists of hiking for either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement is announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, coronavirus cancellation policies were not extending until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Many hotels have a treadmill and a treadmill that you can borrow, even if they're not in the room.
If you do not have a treadmill or if you do not like to wear treadmills, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to allow the material to heat up too much (which may cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, it takes more than one minute.
Filters differ in their efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by physical force are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers who are to visit high tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing isolated and unmanaged areas.
If you're used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are the norm.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, oddly enough, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used year-round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts and other nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be dried or liquid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simply spiced dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the chair.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety problems, as it is possible for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle but is left with one leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him along as he pursues.
First of all, most riders wear high-heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the ladder straps to detach from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought after place for mountaineering in Chile, known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and tall granite plumes.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually making new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Snowboarding sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, consisting of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard board attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who arrange their entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is extremely old. We have cave paintings that depict skiers as far back as 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, skiing by shift or skiing.
It is a related activity, but usually not involving alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than you would on foot, but you'll rarely be able to reach the speeds typical for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organised as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to do it at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, holders of a Schengen visa do not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen Member States separately, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition of what items are antiques, and some tax authorities consider items over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition varies by geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer farming is an important source of income among the Sami, and the trade-related culture is also important for many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma population.
If the country you are visiting has a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified manner compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term used for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and is of many kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea blasts and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather in the area as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" will probably give you the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are plentiful, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports without a gender (X) declaration or documents updated to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scan without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Backflow is the backflow to the ocean from waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current to deep water can form.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to head into a position where you're not trapped again, and depending on your skills and whether or not anyone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock is more rapid than culture shock (less persistent than honeymoon euphoria), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have special difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the customs of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, realizing that visiting a new country involves an adjustment process.
The world doesn't always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for kids in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is usually constant, and the sound and light show seems to be a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula come together to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m (14,090 ft).
In remote places with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally can't take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside, with an unobstructed view of the satellite, to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including by pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to university, without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of distance learning abroad may even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
There is normally a tuition fee that is paid when enrolling in these educational programmes.
 Finland is a great place for boating.  The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national recreational activity of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in 40.
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go on excursions on a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means near the big city and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the personal fears and dislikes about other things that manifest in a lot of people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries.Often, delivery time is critical for documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they've sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and unload.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for that privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it for you).
It's not cheap, though: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate in business class and up to 11 times more in first class!
In general, it is also pointless to seek discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in a context where they charge according to the requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres, are lined with traditional 18th-century red-brick roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views over the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble carvings of doves over some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became outside the country following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scottburb bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north you can visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and many women alive who survived the internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, among other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, uncivilized and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as best you can, as someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved).
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a little courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, molid and fir trees and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
And they can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes aren't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorca's cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during summer time, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, like the word "you", always start with a capital letter, even inside the sentence.
It's an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of them being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you should pay more attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel behind them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively light grammar and is generally regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn more about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may conclude prematurely that Portuguese is close enough that it is not necessary to study it.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Because in their heyday light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're usually in cities or on campuses, being more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum flowers were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants look no better than in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to pick just one.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, collecting specimens will also result in your expulsion, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily navigate and you can buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
But being in the upper tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when it's clear, less often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, where tradition holds that the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried alongside their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take is going to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for organizing a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night up in the open air to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often meeting at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals have been unable to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not so often a problem, you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard clothing in the business environment, and coworkers address each other using their surnames or job titles.
Harmony at work is essential, with emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
