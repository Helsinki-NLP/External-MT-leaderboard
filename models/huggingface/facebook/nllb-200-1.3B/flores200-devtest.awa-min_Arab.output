The tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar are all in the genus Panthera. The cat may have all four claws.
The tiger's roar is not the same as the lion's full-throated roar, but rather the sentence of a harsh, shouted word.
Ocelot preferred to eat small animals. They caught monkeys, snakes, rats and birds, almost all of which were much smaller than the animals they preyed on.
Scientists believe that osselites chased animals (prey) and took prey by smell, smell or while on the ground.
They are nocturnal, and can see well in the dark, and move very quietly, as they prefer to blend in with their surroundings.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from its main population (such as moving to a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island and not being able to return from there easily), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.

The original population has not changed at all, they still need adaptation.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to appear distinct from other populations.

Mosasaurus was the greatest hunter of his time, so he feared no one but the other Mosasaurus.

We don't know for sure, but it may have been a thorny tongue. Its diet included turtles, giant mackerel, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a carnivore.

For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most prevalent film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but the only orientation ratio is taken by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The orientation ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.

The essentially controversial and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by keeping the scale of the arrangement in the image.
According to this rule, the most suitable place for the main subject is at the dividing point of the line dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).

However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can be traced back 25 to 30 years.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture can be defined by age, race, class, location/gender.
The characteristics that uniquely define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including moods, manners, and arguments.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take the example of some unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, and unfortunately or through deliberate abuse were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been given up for adoption by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases these children have been abandoned by the parents due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before they are left alone or run away.
Others are accused of having pets; others are said to live alone in the wild.
When brought from amongst fully non-human animals, feral children display almost exclusively animal-specific behaviour (within physical limits), such as being afraid of humans or of being separated from humans.



Virtual Scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to question, indicate, and explain processes that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.

The use of video recordings, month by month, has pioneered important discoveries useful in reading facial activity that is extinguished in milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person's correct interpretation of a particular expression can determine whether someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, points out that many people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still make a correct assessment of honesty.
He also suggested that this ability to explain human behavior could be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation, one with hidden variation and the other with visible variation.
Mutations add new genetic variation and selection removes expressed variation from the group.
Each generation of isolation and recombination causes a shift in diversity between the two groups.
Outside of the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available arboreal plant resources.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The most readily available plant resources are proteins in leaves and fruits, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.

All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised why our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.

The war lasted for the next 40 years and was fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, through the use of the pseudo-army.



The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was using mostly U-boats to try to block this route.

It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep goats for milk, hair, meat and skins.


The wagonway was made of only wooden parallel planks to allow the horses to achieve greater speed and to pull more weight than the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
The use of railings to hold tracks in place was long overdue. Gradually, however, it was realized that railings would be more efficient if iron bars were applied to the tracks.
This became commonplace but iron caused the wagons to have too much friction on the wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railways were introduced.

Their ancestors, the Astralopithecus, did not usually walk straight.
Bivalve specialization has been found in the fossil of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saheltropus may have walked on bipedal feet as early as seven million years ago.

The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nidicolous, meaning that both can live in their host's nest or in the habitat.
The United States has approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a major neurological disorder in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is an AEC disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.

As knowledge of Greek declined, the West broke itself off from the Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.

Tone rhythms that are not just responses to external periodic signals have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, trees, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue the period of cyclic processes that run independently even in the absence of external signals.
One of the key suggestions of the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershé and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
People have experimented with DNA in phase with radioactive phosphorus or with radioactive sulfur in phase with protein in phase.
Depending on the type of mutation, the mutation can have different effects, with the extent of the affected genetic material being of great importance in determining whether the affected cells are genes.
Mutations in the genome alone can lead to the development of children, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.

Why do transport systems often have these complaints? Who fails them on a daily basis? Is it just because they are useless transport engineers? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of different drivers and vehicles and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.

To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in planning, designing and operating road connectivity.

Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break up with little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The nearest part of the crust is about 70 km thick and the farthest part is 100 km thick.
It is thick under the Maria and thick under the Highlands.
The thickness of the crust allowed for more lava to be deposited in the nearby area, making it easier for lava to rise above the surface.
The theory of satisfaction focuses on finding out what people want and what they want from them.
Theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires. As a person grows, their needs and desires change dramatically.

The most famous binary satisfaction theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two Factor theory.

It makes it difficult for managers to make tough decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, assign responsibility and hold people accountable.
