This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but also provides details that are not normally obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown above and pale or carotenoid-pigmented below.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed stem called a rhinus, but still have other distinguishing features - beard and beardlets - researchers have concluded that the rhinus most likely evolved later by developing other distinguishing features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control and demonstration, and researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen represents an adult plumage, not a chicken's down.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it was the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen had the plumage of an adult, not the plumage of a chicken.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth in, causing tides, so does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, a large portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally done by low-tech methods: the voter closes in the booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French election laws are quite strict about procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes have been added to them except those of the people who were allowed to vote and whose votes were duly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the process, and the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adecco with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimony could be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts have deemed the publication of photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when publishing photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is handed down.
The document, according to the leak, will address a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly touched upon include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who took part in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of the rangers, as the test was supervised and evaluated.
The NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers for the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage for the National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martey took the oath of office of the new Provisional Electoral Council (VIS), which consists of nine members.
This is Martey's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Interim Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of broken iPods were reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 c-rays associated with these devices.
Last week, the Department of Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating that the company described as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer stole a tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman, as she was straying into the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if you inject the hormone, it will increase the maturation of the baby's lungs during fetal development.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two onboard autographs, or "black boxes".
His fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna, too.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of the two moons. It's as unique an event as she is. She's a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels said, "The moon was as awesome as I was -- maybe even more awesome -- I love it and I'll miss it -- I hope it's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have risen 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her view that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign during the 2010 federal election campaign.
34% of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll found that 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three-man relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve the pain because it's banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
It was announced on Tuesday that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water to Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There's no additional transportation to Wembley, no ground trains, no parking and no interceptors on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be held behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) report that the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) has allowed the new species to evolve in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped in any way, it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be spun and plated, and it can be chipped or rolled.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "face-writing".
You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions  are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
You can make a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container and then sealing the mixture into a balloon with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which is unusual, and then it will form a shell-like structure.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Fragments of sewer systems have been found in homes in Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster mode of transportation.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are a larger number of medium-sized cats, which eat small prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray domestic cats) eat and hunt much larger numbers of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat species does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride includes one to three adult males, as well as females and young, which can number up to thirty.
The females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves very much like wolf packs or dogs, animals that are remarkably similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and also very dangerous to their victims.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is a member of the same genus as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like shouting out sentences from unintelligible words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they get a chance, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by scent, tracking its movement through the ground by scent.
They have excellent night vision and can move almost imperceptibly, tracking their prey by blending into the environment and then attacking it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all -- it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that you can't say they're the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, the emergence of new species, and the formation of species is a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants feed on the sun's energy through photosynthesis and also cast shadows.
We build our homes and make clothes from plants, and most of our food is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaur was the most formidable predator of his time, so he feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra row of teeth in the sky, so that anyone who came in its path was not spared.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a split tongue, and he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus would not have been able to match it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as boar, peacock, snails and a rodent species like the slug.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, the rich enjoyed sharing feasts, during which they ate on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's dwelling place.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods at ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special pyramid-shaped towers called "zikkurate" were erected.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a home was not of much importance.
Most of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, and shops had open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and, as he moved further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
But regardless of when it was discovered, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Treasure of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
But that's not true, because even though it says something on the back, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads: "The present Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence this large parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was folded for convenient storage.
So it's quite possible that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of the Neptune operation and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It was run by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France, which became known as Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, Free French and American forces liberated southern France and marched toward Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, the speakers of which are a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil", and is a cognate of the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of a society in a certain way.
Civilization culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuous cultural presence and the continuous spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government, the only organ of which was Congress.
Congress had no taxing power, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and enforced all its acts.
He also had no authority to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous approval of all states, but the states were so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and the Formula 1 car race.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its location in a cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Simonosek Treaty, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for static photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is the same size as digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a little bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with small integers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The rule of thirds, which is often used and ridiculed, is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in language and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are there for that very purpose.
The center of church power was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being adhered to.
Soon after the war began, Britain sea-blocked Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated widely accepted international laws, enshrined in several international treaties over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unimpeded underwater warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were prevalent among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations sought to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his supervisor at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique way of denoting time periods was used; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up for all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true in the army, for ranks are now based on merit rather than origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in subjects not related to worldly life, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (light) for meditation.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid insight into Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to detect even if you know it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the pharaoh's memory.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and relatives.
The upward motion of the loop looks like a V, and the downward motion of the loop looks like a parenthesis or a square without a bottom.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and move the bow forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand is holding the bow and move it back.
Moving the string upward usually produces a softer sound, while moving the string downward is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own line, but remember, the line is printed for musical reasons, and it's usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of angry women from the marketplace forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one of the crowd nodded to a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the surplus profits from long-term exploitation of the Filipinos were the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to create the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually beyond cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, not by society.
For example, one could say that the car is the inevitable cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the invention of new treatments for injuries in health care.
Romanticism largely embraced cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichtel and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, it gave rise to associated customs and culture that, in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than the goods offered on the Byzantine markets.
At this point, the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25-30 years.
The style began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the greatest achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Natural agriculture  is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture  is a simple, often organic, system of farming that uses seeds from plants growing in the ecosystem, along with the use of seed rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel oppressed by society's standards and allow those people to define who they are.
Subcultures may differ in age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often express their identity through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several sad cases where children were not in contact with adults during their adulthood because of lack of attention, bad circumstances, or deliberate abuse.
Some of these children were isolated by people (usually their own parents) and in some cases, this rejection was the result of parents not accepting their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before they fled or were abandoned.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If fully raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child will display behaviors (within physical limits) similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, scaffolding is way ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a Microsoft Office scraper.
The virtual learning aid scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that a learner might find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not given care, education, and nurturing.
We believe foster care is safe for children.
Our child welfare system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care system should provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that 'learning' and 'socialization' are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also named as new facets of motivation by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his or her microexpressions.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sachs described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation brings in new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of emerging variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation brings about variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs at the expense of available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences, such as stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they're poorly absorbed by primates like us if they're not cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digested but is also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
With all of this in mind, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" much as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include taking large amounts of fluid (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, causing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force you have, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, which is the process of visualizing the various deities to purify energy channels, activate chakras, and achieve enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it was fought in the real world, using proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian placederate.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, while also preventing the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Company during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to themselves to keep milk, wool, meat and skins at hand.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goat herders, usually children or teenagers, similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the gauge roads were simply parallel logs, they allowed horses to transport larger loads at a higher speed than the slightly bumpy roads of the time.
Scales were used long ago to hold the rails in place, but it later became clear that the paths were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more.
The wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first railways were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
For their Australopithecine ancestors, walking upright was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the remains of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sachelantropic was walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to ease some of the suffering.
It's usually a symptomatic treatment, but if we need more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by human scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have added to the problems.
After passage by Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap's leaflets.
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read before his troops in New York on July 9.
Dunlap's 25 leaflets are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and the original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survived to the present day.
They're often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot more to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information processing, which is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits"  or "bits" if computer jargon is used.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose quickly.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of a medicine or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient bed bugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making MS the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by applying the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and conducting observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often heavily dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, are found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, which are viruses.
They did two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go out into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
An example is the visit, photography, and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, and they are passed by people whose work is in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is connected to and supports the car-based transportation system in one way or another.
Now, science indicates that a huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you cannot predict the driver's behavior with 100% probability.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often fairly systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, the relationships between three basic quantities were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies, find food and mate.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
The ostrich and the partridge are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon is the second longest and first largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km long, with thousands of smaller rivers flowing into it.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments erected by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they are all found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they would transition to new states to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of the smallest particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil lost its status and became less popular.
People now type on computer screens and never have to deal with a sharpener.
You can only guess what happens to the keyboard as more and more technology comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to keep many protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then the re-splitting of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the hills.
There could be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner, so the lava was easier to lift to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people to act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside as they grow older.
These theories look at what makes people want to do what they do and what makes people around them do or not do certain things.
The two popular theories about content  are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory of motivation.
Generally, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start managing people who were previously their equal in status.
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating work, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the team has done and take it upon himself.
Because the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They're usually more autonomous than employees in traditional teams, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management can't always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a team of leaders to which each participant reports.
Why should organizations go through the time-consuming process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be shown.
And in the end, a group of organizations working together to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and experience building.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The data from neuroscience provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to consciousness, narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is being used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, injury, lesion, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes that go on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is forming a very important area of computer science that looks at machine behavior and learning and the "injecting" of intelligence into them.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples: control, planning and scheduling, responding to a client's diagnosis and questions, and facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These questions are divided into disciplines that are designed to solve problems that we face in our daily lives.
Currently, AI is often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in some home computer and video game software applications.
School tours are very important for any classroom. Very often teachers want to take their students to places where they cannot get to by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can visit museums, an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Posting the excursion to the virtual space for everyone to see  is also a great way to refresh the memory of the excursion and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old versions are still accessible -- they serve as a memorial album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of the audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "helps students to understand the world around them better", and it encourages students to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers. - Toto, 2004.
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to extend their learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to online material, students can define their own position in the context of other people's work, as well as articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa  is a lovely bilingual capital of Canada with a wealth of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
A surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans in the United States than citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a continent of its own in terms of wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a route from Europe to India through the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It 's also good to wear a ring (just not too expensive to look like).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can make them feel harassed, often harassed, held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm and firm in your refusal to be a man (no matter what your culture may be).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco renamed the city Ed-Dar-el-Bayda, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts here named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tijinas, pottery, leather goods, hourglasses and a whole range of trinkets, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a fairly safe place, you should check in advance about any travel outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, and it is also a place where you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can take a mototaxi to Goma, the usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger posed by desert sands.
When we were filming Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic color, not African.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park's area is  19,500 km2; it has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the leading among South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for guarding and visiting the park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South Africa's national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider their main attraction.
The grid of buildings that line the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a glittering column diagram highlighted by the waters of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque sights in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the coast of the Jhulun Peninsula, which is across the street.
Most of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the land reclaimed from the sea on the northern shore.
It's a place that the British colonizers took over, and if you're looking for evidence of a colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove scrub, extending from the coast 80 km (50 mi) inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps  they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to estimates, there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
The  route is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oiapoc River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oiapoc River and connects Oiapoc, Brazil, to Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoc, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the sub-bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarines were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced natural agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaykur and the Paiaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which had been called "the vast province of the East Indies", came into being as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on these islands, which is in Port Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer, winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above +30¬∞C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same all year round.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
Park officials warn: stay within 100 yards of bears and wolves, and within 25 yards of all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may seem,  buffalo, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep the proper distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their privacy.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid preparing or carrying smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of Tupu'a supreme leader Tamse Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the phutiqua.
In central Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in Wyethmata Bay, Tamaki Drive is a popular beach destination.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore.
The most popular local beer  is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better transported.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, bottled water is not difficult to find.
The Australians don't understand the idea of "flat white". "Little black" is espresso, cappuccino they serve with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and although the fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
The reef is a year-round destination for many trips, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cube medusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
The crested crocodile is not active in the ocean, and its main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to avoid worrying about where to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfer or even combination packages that include flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants sleep on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this to be a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have already ended, there may be areas of the festival where music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, make sure to find out where your cabin is, as walking on the ice can make a rather creepy noise that can disturb sleep for the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include walking around the city.
Usually casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in good spirits.
Some clubs offer free alcohol, but getting drunk is a mental blur, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is planning to drive through high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you will not be able to drive as well as on a normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to allow you to get stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall, hail, condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously year-round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
The term safari in everyday usage means a land trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, so even with the usual equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you can see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "shrub exploration", "hiking safari" or "walking") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the date was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules may vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer ironing and ironing board rentals, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have a iron or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironing socks, you can try a felt, if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which may cause it to settle or in very rare cases to burn).
There are many different ways to treat water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters are effective in many ways, and if you are in doubt, you should consider buying water from sealed bottles and a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they have never seen in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain points without taxes or excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, barren and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on the alert for steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 miles/h (56-64 km/h)  and strict observance of them is even more important than anything else.
However, oddly enough, mobile phone service is much better here than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is very abundant and varied, and it is similar to the confectionery of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, apple baking  year round, and cherry and plum baking appear in the summer.
German baking often uses almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and popular cakes are often perfectly paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling flour confections, try what, depending on the region, are called doughnuts or doughnuts with filling.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices mixed with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is used extensively in curry, and in South India and some coastal regions, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to refer to the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarification, the term most often refers to food native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of spicy dishes, with the most preference given to flavor additives such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The sternum is the support for the rider's legs, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety concerns as there is a chance of the leg getting stuck.
If the rider's leg is caught in the stirrup after the horse has dropped, the running horse can pull him away.
First, most riders wear high-heeled riding boots with smooth and fairly thin soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety arches that allow the leather strap to fall off if the rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering, known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
From the top, you can enjoy the stunning mountain scenery, and rock climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its enormous climbing potential.
Mountain winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending over snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Mountain skiing  is the main tourist destination for many ski lovers (also sometimes called "ski idlers"), who plan their holidays entirely around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The history of skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to, but does not usually include, hiking up the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as skating on the slope requires stiffer skis and boots.
Let's say that the ski route  is a walking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than you would if you were walking, but you can only achieve this speed on a treadmill in very rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and you have a ski rack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean applying for a visa and going through passport control several times.
But the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Once you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
